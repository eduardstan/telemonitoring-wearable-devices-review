TI  - Improvements in Patient Monitoring in the Intensive Care Unit: Survey Study.
PG  - e19091
LID - 10.2196/19091 [doi]
LID - e19091
AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to demographic change and, more recently, coronavirus disease 
      (COVID-19), the importance of modern intensive care units (ICU) is becoming 
      apparent. One of the key components of an ICU is the continuous monitoring of 
      patients' vital parameters. However, existing advances in informatics, signal 
      processing, or engineering that could alleviate the burden on ICUs have not yet 
      been applied. This could be due to the lack of user involvement in research and 
      development. OBJECTIVE: This study focused on the satisfaction of ICU staff with 
      current patient monitoring and their suggestions for future improvements. We 
      aimed to identify aspects of monitoring that interrupt patient care, display 
      devices for remote monitoring, use cases for artificial intelligence (AI), and 
      whether ICU staff members are willing to improve their digital literacy or 
      contribute to the improvement of patient monitoring. We further aimed to identify 
      differences in the responses of different professional groups. METHODS: This 
      survey study was performed with ICU staff from 4 ICUs of a German university 
      hospital between November 2019 and January 2020. We developed a web-based 36-item 
      survey questionnaire, by analyzing a preceding qualitative interview study with 
      ICU staff, about the clinical requirements of future patient monitoring. 
      Statistical analyses of questionnaire results included median values with their 
      bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals, and chi-square tests to compare the 
      distributions of item responses of the professional groups. RESULTS: In total, 86 
      of the 270 ICU physicians and nurses completed the survey questionnaire. The 
      majority stated they felt confident using the patient monitoring equipment, but 
      that high rates of false-positive alarms and the many sensor cables interrupted 
      patient care. Regarding future improvements, respondents asked for wireless 
      sensors, a reduction in the number of false-positive alarms, and hospital 
      standard operating procedures for alarm management. Responses to the display 
      devices proposed for remote patient monitoring were divided. Most respondents 
      indicated it would be useful for earlier alerting or when they were responsible 
      for multiple wards. AI for ICUs would be useful for early detection of 
      complications and an increased risk of mortality; in addition, the AI could 
      propose guidelines for therapy and diagnostics. Transparency, interoperability, 
      usability, and staff training were essential to promote the use of AI. The 
      majority wanted to learn more about new technologies for the ICU and required 
      more time for learning. Physicians had fewer reservations than nurses about 
      AI-based intelligent alarm management and using mobile phones for remote 
      monitoring. CONCLUSIONS: This survey study of ICU staff revealed key improvements 
      for patient monitoring in intensive care medicine. Hospital providers and medical 
      device manufacturers should focus on reducing false alarms, implementing hospital 
      alarm standard operating procedures, introducing wireless sensors, preparing for 
      the use of AI, and enhancing the digital literacy of ICU staff. Our results may 
      contribute to the user-centered transfer of digital technologies into practice to 
      alleviate challenges in intensive care medicine. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

LID - 10.3233/SHTI200676 [doi]
AB  - eHealth is the use of modern information and communication technology (ICT) for 
      trans-institutional healthcare purposes. Important subtopics of eHealth are 
      health data sharing and telemedicine. Most of the clinical documentation to be 
      shared is collected in patient records to support patient care. More 
      sophisticated approaches to electronic patient records are trans-institutional or 
      (inter-)national. Other aims for clinical documentation are quality management, 
      reimbursement, legal issues, and medical research. Basic prerequisite for eHealth 
      is interoperability, which can be divided into technical, semantic and process 
      interoperability. There is a variety of international standards to support 
      interoperability. Telemedicine is a subtopic of eHealth, which bridges spatial 
      distance by using ICT for medical (inter-)actions. We distinguish telemedicine 
      among healthcare professionals and telemedicine between health care professionals 
      and patients. Both have a great potential to face the challenges of aging 
      societies, the increasing number of chronically ill patients, multimorbidity and 
      low number of physicians in remote areas. With ongoing digitalization more and 
      more data are available digitally. Clinical documentation is an important source 
      for big data analysis and artificial intelligence. The patient has an important 
      role: Telemonitoring, wearable technologies, and smart home devices provide 
      digital health data from daily life. These are high-quality data which can be 
      used for medical decisions.

TI  - A remote healthcare monitoring framework for diabetes prediction using machine 
      learning.
PG  - 45-57
LID - 10.1049/htl2.12010 [doi]
AB  - Diabetes is a metabolic disease that affects millions of people each year. It is 
      associated with an increased likelihood of vital organ failures and decreased 
      quality of life. Early detection and regular monitoring are crucial for managing 
      diabetes. Remote patient monitoring can facilitate effective intervention and 
      treatment paradigms using current technology. This work proposes an end-to-end 
      remote monitoring framework for automated diabetes risk prediction and 
      management, using personal health devices, smart wearables and smartphones. A 
      support vector machine was developed for diabetes risk prediction using the Pima 
      Indian Diabetes Database, after feature scaling, imputation, selection and 
      augmentation. This work achieved the performance metrics of accuracy, sensitivity 
      and specificity scores at 83.20%, 87.20% and 79% respectively through the tenfold 
      stratified cross validation method, which is competitive with existing methods. 
      Patients can use multiple healthcare devices, smartphones and smartwatches to 
      measure vital parameters, curb the progression of diabetes and close the 
      communication loop with medical professionals. The proposed framework enables 
      medical professionals to make informed decisions based on the latest diabetes 
      risk predictions and lifestyle insights while attaining unobtrusiveness, reduced 
      cost, and vendor interoperability.

TI  - BlockIoT: Blockchain-based Health Data Integration using IoT Devices.
PG  - 1119-1128
AB  - The development and adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHR) and health 
      monitoring Internet of Things (IoT) Devices have enabled digitization of patient 
      records and has also substantially transformed the healthcare delivery system in 
      aspects such as remote patient monitoring, healthcare decision making, and 
      medical research. However, data tends to be fragmented among health 
      infrastructures, and prevents interoperability of medical data at the point of 
      care. In order to address this gap, we introduce BlockIoT that uses blockchain 
      technology to transfer previously inaccessible and centralized data from medical 
      devices to EHR systems, which provides greater insight to providers who can, in 
      turn, provide better outcomes for patients. This notion of interoperability of 
      medical device data is possible through an Application Programming Interface 
      (API), which serves as a versatile endpoint for all incoming medical device data, 
      a distributed file system that ensures data resilience, and knowledge templates 
      that analyze, identify, and represent medical device data to providers. Our 
      participatory design survey on BlockIoT demonstrates that BlockIoT is a suitable 
      system to supplement physicians' clinical practice and increases efficiency in 
      most healthcare specialties, including cardiology, pulmonology, endocrinology, 
      and primary care.

      eHealth Environments.
PG  - 3393-3403
LID - 10.2147/JMDH.S429071 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: The technological advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT) creates 
      opportunities in various social sectors. Patients in clinics or home care have 
      their comfort and safety enhanced with remote monitoring, sensors and 
      applications that control and transfer patient data. These applications must be 
      trustworthy, since they deal with sensitive data. PURPOSE: The purpose of this 
      work is to identify gaps in trustworthiness, availability, effectiveness, 
      security and other attributes. Also, to highlight challenges and opportunities 
      for research and give guidance on choosing the right technology or application 
      based on the resources available to support patients and doctors, protocol of 
      communication and maturity level of these technologies. METHODOLOGY: This work 
      presents a systematic review of the literature following four steps: Definition 
      of the Research Questions, Conduct Search, Screening of Papers, and Data 
      Extraction and Mapping Process. RESULTS: Based on the articles studied, it was 
      possible to answer important questions about eHealth applications. The results 
      highlight how eHealth applications can enhance patient care by monitoring health 
      data and supporting doctors' decision-making with a reasonable level of 
      trustworthiness. Additionally, the results demonstrate how applications can 
      notify external caregivers in emergencies and assist in diagnosis and treatment 
      of illnesses. However, these applications still face problems related to sensor 
      lifetime, medical data sharing, interoperability and lack of standardization. 
      Finally, we suggest a literature mapping to support the choice of technologies 
      based on resources available, communication protocol and technological maturity. 
      CONCLUSION: This work carries out a systematic literature review to discuss 
      state-of-the-art eHealth applications and gather new information of current 
      research. In this process it was possible to show how these applications work, 
      map out their main technological characteristics to assist the decision-making 
      process for future works and uncover eHealth applications' strengths, future 
      perspectives and challenges, specifically related to the high level of 
      trustworthiness necessary.

TI  - Integration of mobile sensors in a telemedicine hospital system: 
      remote-monitoring in COVID-19 patients.
PG  - 93-97
LID - 10.1007/s10389-021-01655-2 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The goal is to design and, in a next step, establish a scalable, 
      multi-center telemonitoring platform based on existing systems for monitoring 
      COVID-19 patients in home quarantine. In particular, the focus will be on raw 
      data acquisition, integration of sensor data into the hospital system, structured 
      data storage, and interoperability. SUBJECT AND METHODS: Data necessary for 
      monitoring, otherwise provided in various portals, will be continuously queried 
      and integrated into the hospital system via a new interface in this 
      proof-of-concept work. RESULTS: Based on extensive preliminary work at Klinikum 
      rechts der Isar with a structured clinical database, we extend our system's 
      integration of raw data and visualization in dashboards, as well as scientific 
      provision of data from mobile sensors for monitoring patients in home quarantine. 
      CONCLUSION: Based on existing integrated telemonitoring systems supporting 
      semantic and syntactic interoperability, short-term provision of scientific 
      databases is possible. The integration of different mobile sensors into a 
      clinical system for remote monitoring of patients around the clock is still new 
      and to our knowledge unique.

AB  - Biometric monitoring technologies (BioMeTs) have attracted the attention of the 
      health care community because of their user-friendly form factor and multi-sensor 
      data-collection capabilities. The potential benefits of remote monitoring for 
      collecting comprehensive, longitudinal, and contextual datasets span therapeutic 
      areas, and both chronic and acute disease settings. Importantly, multimodal 
      BioMeTs unlock the ability to generate rich contextual data to augment digital 
      measures. Currently, the availability of devices is no longer the main factor 
      limiting adoption but rather the ability to integrate fit-for-purpose BioMeTs 
      reliably and safely into clinical care. We provide a critical review of the state 
      of art for multimodal BioMeTs in clinical care and identify three unmet clinical 
      needs: 1) expand the abilities of existing ambulatory unimodal BioMeTs; 2) adapt 
      standardized clinical test protocols ("spot checks'') for use under free living 
      conditions; and 3) develop novel applications to manage rehabilitation and 
      chronic diseases. As the field is still in an early and quickly evolving state, 
      we make practical recommendations: 1) to select appropriate BioMeTs; 2) to 
      develop composite digital measures; and 3) to design interoperable software to 
      ingest, process, delegate, and visualize the data when deploying novel clinical 
      applications. Multimodal BioMeTs will drive the evolution from in-clinic 
      assessments to at-home data collection with a focus on prevention, 
      personalization, and long-term outcomes by empowering health care providers with 
      knowledge, delivering convenience, and an improved standard of care to patients.

TI  - LoRaChainCare: An IoT Architecture Integrating Blockchain and LoRa Network for 
      Personal Health Care Data Monitoring.
LID - 10.3390/s22041497 [doi]
LID - 1497
AB  - Over the past several years, the adoption of HealthCare Monitoring Systems (HCS) 
      in health centers and organizations like hospitals or eldery homes growth 
      significantly. The adoption of such systems is revolutionized by a propelling 
      advancements in IoT and Blockchain technologies. Owing to technological 
      advancement in IoT sensors market, innovations in HCS to monitor patients health 
      status have motivated many countries to strength their efforts to support their 
      citizens with such care delivery systems under the directives of a physician who 
      has access to patient's data. Nevertheless, secure data sharing is a principal 
      patient's concern to be comfort to use such systems. Current HCS are not able to 
      provide reassuring security policies. For that, one of our focus in this work, is 
      to provide security countermeasures, likewise cost-efficient solution for HCS by 
      integrating storage model based on Blockchain and Interplanetary File Systems 
      (IPFS). Blockchain technology is an emerging solution in pharmaceutical industry 
      and starts to take place for HCS and allows HealthCare providers to track 
      connected devices and control access to shared data, hence protecting patients' 
      privacy. Furthermore, the addition of Edge and Fog computing has improved HCS to 
      react in real-time and enhance their reliability. A variety of communication 
      protocols can connect sensor devices to edge/Fog layer and the best choice will 
      depend upon connectivity requirements: range, bandwidth, power, interoperability, 
      security, and reliability. Instead, systems efficiency would decline and hurt if 
      communication protocol is inconsistent. LoRa (Long Range) communications 
      technology is emerging as the leader among Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs) 
      entering the IoT domain benefiting from many features such as long-range 
      distances and low power consumption. This work proposes LoRaChainCare, an 
      architecture model for HCS which combines the technologies Blockchain, Fog/Edge 
      computing, and the LoRa communication protocol. A real implementation of 
      LoRaChainCare system is presented and evaluated in terms of cost, run time and 
      power consumption.

TI  - A conceptual IoT-based early-warning architecture for remote monitoring of 
      COVID-19 patients in wards and at home.
PG  - 100399
LID - 10.1016/j.iot.2021.100399 [doi]
AB  - Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, health services around the globe are struggling. An 
      effective system for monitoring patients can improve healthcare delivery by 
      avoiding in-person contacts, enabling early-detection of severe cases, and 
      remotely assessing patients' status. Internet of Things (IoT) technologies have 
      been used for monitoring patients' health with wireless wearable sensors in 
      different scenarios and medical conditions, such as noncommunicable and 
      infectious diseases. Combining IoT-related technologies with early-warning scores 
      (EWS) commonly utilized in infirmaries has the potential to enhance health 
      services delivery significantly. Specifically, the NEWS-2 has been showing 
      remarkable results in detecting the health deterioration of COVID-19 patients. 
      Although the literature presents several approaches for remote monitoring, none 
      of these studies proposes a customized, complete, and integrated architecture 
      that uses an effective early-detection mechanism for COVID-19 and that is 
      flexible enough to be used in hospital wards and at home. Therefore, this 
      article's objective is to present a comprehensive IoT-based conceptual 
      architecture that addresses the key requirements of scalability, 
      interoperability, network dynamics, context discovery, reliability, and privacy 
      in the context of remote health monitoring of COVID-19 patients in hospitals and 
      at home. Since remote monitoring of patients at home (essential during a 
      pandemic) can engender trust issues regarding secure and ethical data collection, 
      a consent management module was incorporated into our architecture to provide 
      transparency and ensure data privacy. Further, the article details mechanisms for 
      supporting a configurable and adaptable scoring system embedded in wearable 
      devices to increase usefulness and flexibility for health care professions 
      working with EWS.

      This paper, after a description of the GK platform architecture, is focused on 
      the creation of a FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource) IG 
      (Implementation Guide) and its adoption in specific use cases. The final aim is 
      to combine conventional data, collected in the hospital, with unconventional 
      data, coming from wearable devices, to exploit artificial intelligence (AI) 
      models designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a new parsimonious risk 
      prediction model for Type 2 diabetes (T2D).

TI  - Implementation of ISO/IEEE 11073 PHD SpO2 and ECG Device Specializations over 
      Bluetooth HDP following Health Care Profile for Smart Living.
LID - 10.3390/s22155648 [doi]
LID - 5648
AB  - Current m-Health scenarios in the smart living era, as the interpretation of the 
      smart city at each person's level, present several challenges associated with 
      interoperability between different clinical devices and applications. The 
      Continua Health Alliance establishes design guidelines to standardize application 
      communication to guarantee interoperability among medical devices. In this paper, 
      we describe the implementation of two IEEE agents for oxygen saturation level 
      (SpO2) measurements and electrocardiogram (ECG) data acquisition, respectively, 
      and a smartphone IEEE manager for validation. We developed both IEEE agents over 
      the Bluetooth Health Device Profile following the Continua guidelines and they 
      are part of a telemonitoring system. This system was evaluated in a sample 
      composed of 10 volunteers (mean age 29.8 ± 7.1 y/o; 5 females) under supervision 
      of an expert cardiologist. The evaluation consisted of measuring the SpO2 and ECG 
      signal sitting and at rest, before and after exercising for 15 min. Physiological 
      measurements were assessed and compared against commercial devices, and our 
      expert physician did not find any relevant differences in the ECG signal. 
      Additionally, the system was assessed when acquiring and processing different 
      heart rate data to prove that warnings were generated when the heart rate was 
      under/above the thresholds for bradycardia and tachycardia, respectively.

TI  - Design and Usability Assessment of a Multi-Device SOA-Based Telecare Framework 
      for the Elderly.
PG  - 268-279
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2019.2894552 [doi]
AB  - Telemonitoring is a branch of telehealth that aims at remotely monitoring vital 
      signs, which is important for chronically ill patients and the elderly living 
      alone. The available standalone devices and applications for the self-monitoring 
      of health parameters largely suffer from interoperability problems; meanwhile, 
      telemonitoring medical devices are expensive, self-contained, and are not 
      integrated into user-friendly technological platforms for the end user. This 
      paper presents the technical aspects and usability assessment of the 
      telemonitoring features of the HEREiAM platform, which supports heterogeneous 
      information technology systems. By exploiting a service-oriented architecture, 
      the measured parameters collected by off-the-shelf Bluetooth medical devices are 
      sent as XML documents to a private cloud that implements an interoperable health 
      service infrastructure, which is compliant with the most recent healthcare 
      standards and security protocols. This Android-based system is designed to be 
      accessible both via TV and portable devices, and includes other utilities 
      designed to support the elderly living alone. Four usability assessment sessions 
      with quality-validated questionnaires were performed to accurately understand the 
      ease of use, usefulness, acceptance, and quality of the proposed system. The 
      results reveal that our system achieved very high usability scores even at its 
      first use, and the scores did not significantly change over time during a field 
      trial that lasted for four months, reinforcing the idea of an intuitive design. 
      At the end of such a trial, the user-experience questionnaire achieved excellent 
      scores in all aspects with respect to the benchmark. Good results were also 
      reported by general practitioners who assessed the quality of their remote 
      interfaces for telemonitoring.

TI  - Technologies for Interoperable Internet of Medical Things Platforms to Manage 
      Medical Emergencies in Home and Prehospital Care: Protocol for a Scoping Review.
PG  - e40243
LID - 10.2196/40243 [doi]
LID - e40243
AB  - BACKGROUND: Population growth and aging have highlighted the need for more 
      effective home and prehospital care. Interconnected medical devices and 
      applications, which comprise an infrastructure referred to as the Internet of 
      Medical Things (IoMT), have enabled remote patient monitoring and can be 
      important tools to cope with these demographic changes. However, developing IoMT 
      platforms requires profound knowledge of clinical needs and challenges related to 
      interoperability and how these can be managed with suitable technologies. 
      OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this scoping review is to summarize the best practices 
      and technologies to overcome interoperability concerns in IoMT platform 
      development for medical emergencies in home and prehospital care. METHODS: This 
      scoping review will be conducted in accordance with Arksey and O'Malley's 5-stage 
      framework and adhere to the PRISMA-P (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
      Reviews and Meta-analyses Protocols) guidelines. Only peer-reviewed articles 
      published in English will be considered. The databases/web search engines that 
      will be used are IEEE Xplore, PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, National Center for 
      Biotechnology Information, SAGE Journals, and ScienceDirect. The search process 
      for relevant literature will be divided into 4 different steps. This will ensure 
      that a suitable approach is followed in terms of search terms, limitations, and 
      eligibility criteria. Relevant articles that meet the inclusion criteria will be 
      screened in 2 stages: abstract and title screening and full-text screening. To 
      reduce selection bias, the screening process will be performed by 2 reviewers. 
      RESULTS: The results of the preliminary search indicate that there is sufficient 
      literature to form a good foundation for the scoping review. The search was 
      performed in April 2022, and a total of 4579 articles were found. The main 
      clinical focus is the prevention and management of falls, but other medical 
      emergencies, such as heart disease and stroke, are also considered. Preliminary 
      results show that little attention has been given to real-time IoMT platforms 
      that can be deployed in real-world care settings. The final results are expected 
      to be presented in a scoping review in 2023 and will be disseminated through 
      scientific conference presentations, oral presentations, and publication in a 
      peer-reviewed journal. CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review will provide insights and 
      recommendations regarding how interoperable real-time IoMT platforms can be 
      developed to handle medical emergencies in home and prehospital care. The 
      findings of this research could be used by researchers, clinicians, and 
      implementation teams to facilitate future development and interdisciplinary 
      discussions. INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID):

TI  - RADAR-IoT: An Open-Source, Interoperable, and Extensible IoT Gateway Framework 
      for Health Research.
LID - 10.3390/s24144614 [doi]
LID - 4614
AB  - IoT sensors offer a wide range of sensing capabilities, many of which have 
      potential health applications. Existing solutions for IoT in healthcare have 
      notable limitations, such as closed-source, limited I/O protocols, limited cloud 
      platform support, and missing specific functionality for health use cases. 
      Developing an open-source internet of things (IoT) gateway solution that 
      addresses these limitations and provides reliability, broad applicability, and 
      utility is highly desirable. Combining a wide range of sensor data streams from 
      IoT devices with ambulatory mHealth data would open up the potential to provide a 
      detailed 360-degree view of the relationship between patient physiology, 
      behavior, and environment. We have developed RADAR-IoT as an open-source IoT 
      gateway framework, to harness this potential. It aims to connect multiple IoT 
      devices at the edge, perform limited on-device data processing and analysis, and 
      integrate with cloud-based mobile health platforms, such as RADAR-base, enabling 
      real-time data processing. We also present a proof-of-concept data collection 
      from this framework, using prototype hardware in two locations. The RADAR-IoT 
      framework, combined with the RADAR-base mHealth platform, provides a 
      comprehensive view of a user's health and environment by integrating static IoT 
      sensors and wearable devices. Despite its current limitations, it offers a 
      promising open-source solution for health research, with potential applications 
      in managing infection control, monitoring chronic pulmonary disorders, and 
      assisting patients with impaired motor control or cognitive ability.

TI  - Developing a Novel Ontology for Cybersecurity in Internet of Medical 
      Things-Enabled Remote Patient Monitoring.
LID - 10.3390/s24092804 [doi]
LID - 2804
AB  - IoT has seen remarkable growth, particularly in healthcare, leading to the rise 
      of IoMT. IoMT integrates medical devices for real-time data analysis and 
      transmission but faces challenges in data security and interoperability. This 
      research identifies a significant gap in the existing literature regarding a 
      comprehensive ontology for vulnerabilities in medical IoT devices. This paper 
      proposes a fundamental domain ontology named MIoT (Medical Internet of Things) 
      ontology, focusing on cybersecurity in IoMT (Internet of Medical Things), 
      particularly in remote patient monitoring settings. This research will refer to 
      similar-looking acronyms, IoMT and MIoT ontology. It is important to distinguish 
      between the two. IoMT is a collection of various medical devices and their 
      applications within the research domain. On the other hand, MIoT ontology refers 
      to the proposed ontology that defines various concepts, roles, and individuals. 
      MIoT ontology utilizes the knowledge engineering methodology outlined in Ontology 
      Development 101, along with the structured life cycle, and establishes semantic 
      interoperability among medical devices to secure IoMT assets from vulnerabilities 
      and cyberattacks. By defining key concepts and relationships, it becomes easier 
      to understand and analyze the complex network of information within the IoMT. The 
      MIoT ontology captures essential key terms and security-related entities for 
      future extensions. A conceptual model is derived from the MIoT ontology and 
      validated through a case study. Furthermore, this paper outlines a roadmap for 
      future research, highlighting potential impacts on security automation in 
      healthcare applications.

AB  - Smartphone devices capable of monitoring users' health, physiology, activity, and 
      environment revolutionize care delivery, medical research, and remote patient 
      monitoring. Such devices, laden with clinical-grade sensors and cloud 
      connectivity, allow clinicians, researchers, and patients to monitor health 
      longitudinally, passively, and persistently, shifting the paradigm of care and 
      research from low-resolution, intermittent, and discrete to one of persistent, 
      continuous, and high resolution. The collection, transmission, and storage of 
      sensitive health data using mobile devices presents unique challenges that serve 
      as significant barriers to entry for care providers and researchers alike. 
      Compliance with standards like HIPAA and GDPR requires unique skills and 
      practices. These requirements make off-the-shelf technologies insufficient for 
      use in the digital health space. As a result, budget, timeline, talent, and 
      resource constraints are the largest barriers to new digital technologies. The 
      CardinalKit platform is an open-source project addressing these challenges by 
      focusing on reducing these barriers and accelerating the innovation, adoption, 
      and use of digital health technologies. CardinalKit provides a mobile template 
      application and web dashboard to enable an interoperable foundation for 
      developing digital health applications. We demonstrate the applicability of 
      CardinalKit to a wide variety of digital health applications across 18 innovative 
      digital health prototypes.

AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of the study is to assess the experiences, barriers, and 
      expectations regarding current patient monitoring systems among intensive care 
      unit nurses at one university hospital. METHODS: A qualitative exploratory study 
      approach was adopted to test the research questions. RESULTS: Intensive care unit 
      personnel placed a high value on practical criteria such as user friendliness and 
      visualization while assessing the present monitoring system. Poor alarm handling 
      was recognized as possible patient safety hazards. The necessity of high 
      accessibility was highlighted once again for a prospective system; wireless, 
      noninvasive, and interoperability of monitoring devices were requested; and smart 
      phones for distant patient monitoring and alert management improvement were 
      required. CONCLUSION: Core comments from ICU personnel are included in this 
      qualitative research on patient monitoring. All national healthcare involved 
      parties must focus more on user-derived insights to ensure a speedy and effective 
      introduction of digital health technologies in the ICU. The findings from the 
      alarm control or mobile device studies might be utilized to train ICU personnel 
      to use new technology, minimize alarm fatigue, increase medical device 
      accessibility, and develop interoperability standards in critical care practice.

PG  - 1066-1070
LID - 10.3233/SHTI231128 [doi]
AB  - The pandemic necessitated the rapid design, development and implementation of 
      technologies to allow remote monitoring of COVID-19 patients at home. This study 
      aimed to explore the environmental barriers and facilitators to the successful 
      development and implementation of virtual care technologies in this fast-paced 
      context. We interviewed eight staff at a virtual hospital in Australia. We found 
      key facilitators to be a learning organizational culture and strong leadership 
      support. Barriers included interoperability issues, legislative constraints and 
      unrealistic clinician expectations. Also, we found that a combination of 
      hot-desking and the lack of single sign on in the virtual care environment, was 
      reported to create additional work for staff. Overall, despite this unique 
      context, our findings are consistent with prior work examining design and 
      implementation of healthcare technologies. The fast pace and high-pressure 
      environment appeared to magnify previously reported barriers, but also cultivate 
      and foster a learning culture.

TI  - Towards a Secure Thermal-Energy Aware Routing Protocol in Wireless Body Area 
      Network Based on Blockchain Technology.
LID - 10.3390/s20123604 [doi]
LID - 3604
AB  - The emergence of biomedical sensor devices, wireless communication, and 
      innovation in other technologies for healthcare applications result in the 
      evolution of a new area of research that is termed as Wireless Body Area Networks 
      (WBANs). WBAN originates from Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), which are used for 
      implementing many healthcare systems integrated with networks and wireless 
      devices to ensure remote healthcare monitoring. WBAN is a network of wearable 
      devices implanted in or on the human body. The main aim of WBAN is to collect the 
      human vital signs/physiological data (like ECG, body temperature, EMG, glucose 
      level, etc.) round-the-clock from patients that demand secure, optimal and 
      efficient routing techniques. The efficient, secure, and reliable designing of 
      routing protocol is a difficult task in WBAN due to its diverse characteristic 
      and restraints, such as energy consumption and temperature-rise of implanted 
      sensors. The two significant constraints, overheating of nodes and energy 
      efficiency must be taken into account while designing a reliable 
      blockchain-enabled WBAN routing protocol. The purpose of this study is to achieve 
      stability and efficiency in the routing of WBAN through managing temperature and 
      energy limitations. Moreover, the blockchain provides security, transparency, and 
      lightweight solution for the interoperability of physiological data with other 
      medical personnel in the healthcare ecosystem. In this research work, the 
      blockchain-based Adaptive Thermal-/Energy-Aware Routing (ATEAR) protocol for WBAN 
      is proposed. Temperature rise, energy consumption, and throughput are the 
      evaluation metrics considered to analyze the performance of ATEAR for data 
      transmission. In contrast, transaction throughput, latency, and resource 
      utilization are used to investigate the outcome of the blockchain system. 
      Hyperledger Caliper, a benchmarking tool, is used to evaluate the performance of 
      the blockchain system in terms of CPU utilization, memory, and memory 
      utilization. The results show that by preserving residual energy and avoiding 
      overheated nodes as forwarders, high throughput is achieved with the ultimate 
      increase of the network lifetime. Castalia, a simulation tool, is used to 
      evaluate the performance of the proposed protocol, and its comparison is made 
      with Multipath Ring Routing Protocol (MRRP), thermal-aware routing algorithm 
      (TARA), and Shortest-Hop (SHR). Evaluation results illustrate that the proposed 
      protocol performs significantly better in balancing of temperature (to avoid 
      damaging heat effect on the body tissues) and energy consumption (to prevent the 
      replacement of battery and to increase the embedded sensor node life) with 
      efficient data transmission achieving a high throughput value.
