AB  - In this work, we propose and develop healthcare device interoperability (HeDI)—a system to enable device interoperability in IoT-enabled in-home healthcare monitoring platforms. The system consists of multiple sensors, each connected wirelessly to an edge device, acting as a wireless communication gateway to a remote server. The system initiates information handshaking between the sensor adapters and edge device at the beginning of the operation, which is later used to detect the sensor settings to process the data received from the sensor. The system is scalable and dynamically accommodates multiple sensors without any predefined ontologies at the edge device. The implementation of our system avoids dependencies on a system’s physical ports. The low form factor and wireless connectivity of the adapter make the system portable and convenient for in-home health monitoring. Additionally, the system allows multiple homogeneous sensors to operate at the same time in the same system. We implement and evaluate our system with a 3-lead ECG, pulse, and temperature sensors against two different network configurations—star and mesh. We use the data set generated from our implemented system for performance analysis. The network-level analysis of our system shows an average packet delivery ratio of 0.92 for star network configuration and 0.98 for mesh network configuration, ensuring the reliability of performance and its suitability for healthcare monitoring systems.

AB  - In the modern era, the role of antennas has grown dramatically high, especially in biological applications. Because of its size, compactness, non-invasive nature, safety, and cheaper cost, wearable antennas are utilized in numerous industries, including healthcare and Internet of Things (IoT). Additionally, wireless technology and wearable remote monitoring systems are essential methods for healthcare without sacrificing the life. In this paper, a low-profile antenna with Coplanar Waveguide (CPW) feeding technique is designed to operate at three frequencies 2.2GHz/4.2GHz/6GHz in wireless local area networks (WLAN), Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX), and Bluetooth for remote monitoring. Three resonant frequencies are produced using split-ring resonators with a circular shape antenna. To make a wearable antenna for patient monitoring, the proposed antenna is fabricated with a PREPERM paper substrate. This substrate, which is from PREMIX group, has a dielectric constant of 3.55 and a loss tangent of 0.005. The proposed antenna is studied based on parameters such as voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR), radiation patterns, return loss (S11) and gain. For antenna design, simulation and analysis, High-Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS) software has been used.

AB  - Access to adequate medical care can be difficult in many countries, particularly in economically developing countries. There aren't enough medical professionals, such as doctors or nurses, and the nearest hospitals are too far away. Because there is such a severe shortage of resources, it is extremely challenging to provide preventative therapy to persons who are ill. As a direct consequence of this, even persons in good health are falling more behind in their surveillance of their fitness. It is crucial to have a plan in place to address this problem in order to guarantee that persons will not experience a disruption in their capacity to get necessary medical care in the event that this problem arises. Applications of the Internet of Things include ensuring public safety and improving operational efficiencies in transportation, municipal management, manufacturing, and physical activity (IoT). This study investigates its application in medical equipment and suggests an innovative approach to combining the ideas of fog computing and the Internet of Things. A poor health care system that focuses on clinics can be converted into a high-quality system that puts patients at the center with the help of the framework that has been proposed.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) has unleashed the potential to expand the deployment of e-health systems by facilitating remote monitoring and introducing emerging IoT-enabled devices. However, this requires e-health systems to dynamically integrate a variety of heterogeneous IoT-enabled devices. In this paper, a four-phase device integration process is proposed to connect IoT-enabled medical devices with e-health systems through the use of horizontal IoT platforms. Horizontal platforms are used to facilitate the management of heterogeneous devices and their huge amount of data. The IoT-enabled medical devices are classified into direct and indirect devices based on their data availability to the platform. Data collection from direct devices is performed through wired or wireless communication. In contrast, indirect devices make their data available only to the cloud, from where the platform can access and retrieve the data. The proposed integration process is then implemented using OM2M horizontal IoT platform through two use cases of integrating direct and indirect real devices. For each use case, the technical details of the implementation phases are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed device integration process. Finally, technical considerations and challenges are discussed for generalizing the proposed integration process to other medical devices.

AB  - Healthcare industry is evolving rapidly due to the rigorous research and development in health care industry and is contributing to the enormous development the most happening and upcoming innovative block chain technology. This development in both health care and technological industry has enhanced the quality of fitness of an individual by the use of miniaturized sensors that could be invasively or non-invasively embedded to monitor human vital signs to offer a secure patient healthcare system. When sharing personal medical information, data security and comfort are essential requirements for interaction with electronic medical records. However, it is hard for current systems to meet these requirements because they have inconsistent security policies and access control structures. Another problem is switching the medical providers that is extremely unmanageable and creates tedious issues for medical claim approvals since maximum advanced healthcare systems are distributed greatly with low speed issues and frauds. The new solutions should be directed towards improving data access and should be managed by the government in terms of privacy and security requirements to ensure the reliability of data for medical purposes. Block chain technology is the most unique and real solution that promises secure patient data coordination and whole healthcare system, provides pre-approved constraints. Block chain paves the way for a revolution in the traditional pharmaceutical industry and benefits from unique features such as data privacy and transparency. This paper proposes a block chain solution to facilitate patients and healthcare system users to access their health care records with smart contract technology.

AB  - Wireless sensor networks (WSN) are networks consisting of a collection of sensors with the functions of collecting, processing, and transmitting data on the state of the environment. In the article, using the example of a specific case of the so-called WBSM networks (Wireless Body Sensor Network), a service-oriented approach to their implementation is considered as a guarantee of ensuring the standardization and interoperability of the components of their structures when implementing the scenarios of calculations involved in them. This approach will differ from analogs by maximally simplifying the design of calculation scenarios due to the absence of low-level details in the scenario descriptions. The proposed solutions were tested by creating a prototype of a mobile medical intelligence platform WBSM, which enables remote interaction of patients and doctors, which is especially critical in the conditions of a pandemic to identify risk groups of patients with chronic diseases.

AB  - Due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, interest in non-face-to-face telehealth is increasing worldwide, and telehealth services are being activated in various fields. In some countries, successful cases of remote surgery using non-face-to-face telehealth services are emerging one after another. Due to the absence of related standards presented to precisely handle security requirements in a non-face-to-face telehealth environment, security threats in telehealth are proceeding in a form that relies entirely on IT technology. However, the IT technology used in the medical environment is somewhat different from the existing ICT technology, so the need for a cybersecurity framework for non-face-to-face telehealth is becoming a much more important issue. This paper focuses on what needs to be considered to establish an appropriate security model in non-face-to-face telehealth.

AB  - The fifth generation (5G) network has revolutionized the healthcare field, offering high-speed data transfer, low latency, and improved network coverage. This has opened new opportunities to help healthcare providers break through barriers for better care delivery. The paradigm shift towards a distributed patient-centric approach in health care has driven the need for the utilization of 4G and other advanced technologies for smart healthcare. However, the limitations of fourth-generation healthcare systems require machine-to-machine (M2M) or device-to-device (D2D) communication, which can be addressed by 5G network infrastructure with its ultra-low latency, high availability, reliability, and security features. This paper provides an overview of the role of smart healthcare in transforming the healthcare industry through the integration of advanced technologies such as electronic health records (EHRs), telemedicine, internet of things (IoT), wearable devices, artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and 3D printing. It also discusses the key features of 5G networks, including high-speed data transfer, low latency, increased bandwidth, improved network coverage, network slicing, and improved security. Additionally, this paper proposes a 5G-enabled emergency vehicle communication system as a potential application of 5G technology in health care.

AB  - Recently, smart medical devices have become preva-lent in remote monitoring of patients and the delivery of medication. The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic situation has boosted the upward trend of the popularity of smart medical devices in the healthcare system. Simultaneously, different device manufacturers and technologies compete for a share in a smart medical device's market, which forces the integration of diverse smart medical de-vices into a common healthcare ecosystem. Hence, modern unified healthcare communication systems (UHCSs) combine ISO/IEEE 11073 and Health Level Seven (HL7) communication standards to support smart medical devices' interoperability and their communication with healthcare providers. Despite their advantages in supporting various smart medical devices and communication technologies, these standards do not provide any security and suffer from vulnerabilities. Existing studies provide stand-alone security solutions to components of UHCSs and do not cover UHCSs holistically. In this paper, we perform a systematic threat analysis of UHCSs that relies on attack-defense tree (ADTree) formalisms. Considering the attack landscape and defense ecosys-tem, we build an ADTree for UHCSs and convert the ADTree to stochastic timed automata (STA) to perform quantitative analysis. Our analysis using UPPAAL SMC shows that the Man-in-the-Middle and unauthorized remote access attacks are the most probable attacks that a malicious entity could pursue, causing mistreatment to patients. We also extract valuable information about the top threats, the likelihood of performing different individual and simultaneous attacks, and the expected cost for attackers.

The available standalone devices and applications for the self-monitoring of health parameters largely suffer from interoperability problems; meanwhile, telemonitoring medical devices are expensive, self-contained, and are not integrated into user-friendly technological platforms for the end user. This paper presents the technical aspects and usability assessment of the telemonitoring features of the HEREiAM platform, which supports heterogeneous information technology systems. By exploiting a service-oriented architecture, the measured parameters collected by off-the-shelf Bluetooth medical devices are sent as XML documents to a private cloud that implements an interoperable health service infrastructure, which is compliant with the most recent healthcare standards and security protocols. This Android-based system is designed to be accessible both via TV and portable devices, and includes other utilities designed to support the elderly living alone. Four usability assessment sessions with quality-validated questionnaires were performed to accurately understand the ease of use, usefulness, acceptance, and quality of the proposed system. The results reveal that our system achieved very high usability scores even at its first use, and the scores did not significantly change over time during a field trial that lasted for four months, reinforcing the idea of an intuitive design. At the end of such a trial, the user-experience questionnaire achieved excellent scores in all aspects with respect to the benchmark. Good results were also reported by general practitioners who assessed the quality of their remote interfaces for telemonitoring.

AB  - The emergence of the internet of things (IoT) has provided a dynamic change of healthcare system that enables interoperability and secure data transmission for a more effective healthcare delivery. This paper extends the implementation of IoT in combining medical devices and sensors with an IoT platform. Among various fundamental vital signs, respiratory rate is one of the most sensitive indicators of physiological conditions. Although it is deemed as a prognostic parameter that can predict miscellaneous diseases, respiratory rate monitoring remains frequently omitted and considered as time-consuming using manual counting methods. To address this problem, this paper presents a prototype of a respiratory rate monitoring device based on IoT and real-time systems. The device is equipped with an accelerometer sensor to measure abdominal movement generated by the inhale-exhale process. Butterworth filter and peak detection algorithm are applied to the signal to detect respiratory cycles. The proposed system uses the message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) protocol that implements publish-subscribe systems. Respiratory rate results are featured on the Node-RED dashboard with motion and peak signals plotted during the test. Monitoring was carried out on five participants and the results were analyzed using paired t-test. Good performance was demonstrated by having no significant difference in respiratory rate using the proposed method compared to the actual values (p>0.05). Hence, this work provides a convenient technique for respiratory rate estimation and may further allow for the improvement of the effectiveness of remote patient monitoring.

AB  - Extensive research has been dedicated to the exploration of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) to improve healthcare services. The integration of Internet of Things (IoT), medical devices and cloud computing has facilitated a synergistic approach to prevent, diagnose, treat, and manage chronic illnesses more effectively. With remote patient monitoring and real-time feedback, healthcare outcomes can be significantly improved. This Integration of technology with healthcare relies on good network connectivity, adequate bandwidth, and low latency. However, in areas with poor network connectivity, the effectiveness and reliability of these technologies may be compromised. In order to overcome these limitations Dew Computing has emerged as a new paradigm that researchers have explored in resource constrained environments. This paper aims to study the application of IoT and Dew Computing in providing innovative solutions for complementing and strengthening existing e-healthcare. We conducted a comprehensive and systematic literature review to summarize the latest information available on Dew Computing Inspired state-of-the-art frameworks in the healthcare industry. This paper emphasizes the application of Dew Computing in the context of Healthcare IoT to address the issues of restricted scalability and interoperability commonly encountered in cloud computing systems. This is achieved by conducting a thorough analysis of pertinent literature in well-known databases. The scarcity of studies that have evaluated the practical implementation of their research suggests that the application of Dew Computing in eHealth may still be in its early stages of development. This review also identifies the trends and explores potential future directions which could lead to unprecedented breakthroughs in on-demand medical services. Finally, several research challenges and open issues are discussed for further work.

AB  - Modern Smart Health Systems (SHS) involve the concept of connected personal medical devices. These devices significantly improve the patient's lifestyle as they permit remote monitoring and transmission of health data (i.e., telemedicine), lowering the treatment costs for both the patient and the healthcare providers. Although specific SHS communication standards (i.e., ISO/IEEE 11073) enable real-time plug-and-play interoperability and communication between different personal medical devices, they do not specify any features for secure communications. In this paper, we demonstrate how personal medical device communication is indeed vulnerable to different cyber attacks. Specifically, we show how an external attacker can hook into the personal medical device's communication and eavesdrop the sensitive health data traffic, and implement manin-the-middle, replay, false data injection, and denial-of-service attacks. Furthermore, we also propose an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), HEKA, to monitor personal medical device traffic and detect attacks on them. HEKA passively hooks into the personal medical traffic generated by medical devices to learn the contiguous sequence of packets information from the captured traffic and detects irregular traffic-flow patterns using an n-grambased approach and different machine learning techniques. We implemented HEKA in a testbed consisting of eight off-the-shelf personal medical devices and evaluated its performance against four different attacks. Our extensive evaluation shows that HEKA can effectively detect different attacks on personal medical devices with an accuracy of 98.4% and Fl-score of 98%.

When it comes to healthcare costs, the necessity and accessibility of resources, and personal care in general, particularly for older members of society, healthcare has emerged as a key socioeconomic concern in recent years. This new trend in healthcare has made it feasible for doctors to provide remote monitoring, chronic illness management, and seniors care of patients located in remote areas, and it has even made it possible for doctors to care for patients who are institutionalized so long as they remain connected to the internet. The widespread adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) in healthcare and other similar technologies has helped to tackle a number of problems by utilizing remote monitoring, telemedicine, sensors, and other technologies. However, it seems difficult to accomplish widespread adoption because of considerations such as the need to protect users' privacy and the security of their data, the administration of massive amounts of data, scalability, upgradeability, etc. This new trend is both efficient and clever. The advantages and difficulties of trends in healthcare, which have altered the conventional healthcare system by making health management more effective via to their applications, are discussed in this study.

AB  - Blockchain, cryptographically linked blocks of data, is the key technology behind the infamous cryptocurrency Bitcoin, however, blockchain can serve more use cases than just cryptocurrency. The technology has use cases in any industry that generates and transfers data. In a use case such as cryptocurrency the blockchain is used to manage transactions from peer-to-peer in a way that does not allow for that transaction's data to be manipulated by one of the involved parties or a third party. This is a valuable process that other industries could leverage. One such industry that could benefit from applying blockchain technology for a multitude of cases is the healthcare industry. Primary care doctors could be connected to a blockchain system that allowed them to access patient data and securely monitor the respective patient, pharmaceutical companies could increase their products validity in the marketplace with individual product tracking, and the insurance industry could trust all the information about a client. All of these are possible use cases for blockchain in the healthcare industry. Currently, the healthcare industry is not leveraging the blockchain at scale. Within this paper we are going to explore the possibilities for blockchain technology and the use cases in the healthcare industry specifically, and how the different industries within the healthcare industry can implement a blockchain system.

AB  - COVID-19 became the headlines of every nation because of its unrivalled transmission speed and outbreaks in humans, but its new variants are raising new challenges after every few months iteratively. Keeping track of travel history and maintaining a record of people coming in contact with any COVID affected individual has become a prime concern to control the spread of this pandemic disease. The existing tracking system lags in fetching records of people who came in contact with the affected one and maintaining travel history across the local boundaries of the cities. In this position paper, we are proposing a framework for an IoT driven blockchain (BC) based secured tracking system that gathers users' travel and meeting history, and it may help with remote health monitoring. The data gathered for the same is treated as immutable and achieves interoperability with the help of Smart Contracts (SC). It could be proved as a useful framework for post COVID-19 economic revival with the help of an IoT driven blockchain based secured model for remote health monitoring & chain tracking.

AB  - Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are recognized for their intelligence as they seamlessly interact with humans, enhancing the physical world through computation, communication, and control. Over the last few years, the evolution of CPS, including IoT components, has significantly impacted many facets of people’s lifestyles. It has been immersed in a wide range of services and applications in various areas, including manufacturing, healthcare, and energy. However, the interrelationship between the cyber and physical worlds gives rise to a multitude of research problems and challenges. In the healthcare field, for instance, CPS introduces complexities related to interoperability, privacy, data security, and real-time data processing with critical implications for the reliability and safety of medical processes. To address these challenges and harness the full potential of CPS in healthcare, this paper, through a comprehensive literature review, aims to discuss cutting-edge CPS technologies and solutions that hold promise for healthcare applications. To this end, we propose a comprehensive architectural model that can serve as a benchmark for implementing CPS in healthcare applications. This model thoroughly details how services, components, and technologies can be integrated to transform massive raw data collected from the physical world into valuable information for an enhanced decision-making process. Finally, a use case on healthcare CPS is presented, outlining its characteristics, the role that different technologies have played in its development, and the major challenges in implementing such systems successfully. This study provides a cohesive understanding of the role CPS can play in empowering healthcare while offering insights into the challenges, and future research trends.

AB  - The CAPABLE project has been funded by the European Union to develop a telemonitoring and coaching platform improving the quality of life for cancer patients. The platform, based on a multi agent blackboard architecture, is classified as a medical device according to the current EU regulation. Thus it needs extensive tests before being put into service for the planned clinical trials, which calls for a dedicated simulating and testing environment. Materials and Methods: Coordination in CAPABLE is achieved through the Case Manager, a component able to generate and notify events to other interested agent components. For representing and exchanging health care information we have adopted HL7 FHIR as a semantic interoperability standard. Results: FHIR has been exploited to design a structured history of a real patient affected by renal cell carcinoma. A simulator has been developed for automating the whole testing process represented by specific scenarios of the patient’s history. Conclusions: The simulator relies on the events produced by the Case Manager for coordinating the agents. This proved to be effective in checking that the agents reactions to new data showing up on the blackboard comply with the expected behavior.

AB  - Web of Things is the concept of controlling smart and communicating systems, Connected Objects (COs), through Web applications. Web technologies offer interoperable and flexible technologies to implement sophisticated GUI to control COs. However, such technologies are very limited in terms of communication protocols. This paper proposes a lightweight platform to control COs via Web applications without adding any extension to the Web browser. For this, only the standardized protocol HTTP is used by exploiting two JavaScript objects: (i) XMLHttpRequest for synchronous communication and (ii) EventSource for CO-to-Web application communication. The proposed platform implements the basic functionalities, inspired from OUPnP/UPNP, for remote monitoring and controlling of COs such as: (a) Discovering to allow COs advertising their presence to Web applications and Web applications to find available COs, (b) Description to know how controlling COs and their services, (c) Controlling to allow Web application invoking COs services, and finally (d) Eventing to allow CO sending notifications to the adequate Web applications. Moreover, this platform allows dynamic incorporation of pre-implemented control panel (fragment of Web page) on the Web application to control COs.

AB  - The development and adoption of Electronic Health Records and health monitoring Internet of Things (IoT) devices have enabled the digitization of patient records. They have also substantially transformed the healthcare delivery system in remote patient monitoring, healthcare decision-making, and medical research. However, data tends to be fragmented among health information systems, preventing interoperability of medical data at the point of care. In order to address this gap, we propose and implement a novel architecture that utilizes blockchain and IoT technologies for integrating personal health data. The architecture comprises of two components: (1) BlockIoT contains a suite of smart contracts that define data collection and integration functionalities, and (2) RETEL utilizes a novel smart contract deployment and execution architecture. The BlockIoT-RETEL architecture combines these two components to provide a scalable mechanism for bootstrapping a personal health data collection infrastructure in the context of healthcare. We have compared the key functionalities of our system with existing comparable state-of-the-art systems in healthcare and evaluated the performance in prototypical healthcare settings with simulated data that shows promising results.

AB  - The current healthcare ecosystem often faces challenges such as data breaches, unauthorized access, data silos, and difficulties in tracking and verifying medical device supply chains. These issues pose a threat to patient confidentiality, trust in healthcare data, and the efficiency of healthcare operations. To address these challenges, a proposed model introduces a unique approach to bolstering the security and efficiency of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in healthcare through the use of advanced cryptographic techniques. Specifically, the model utilizes a heavy computation algorithm known as Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) for packet verification in IoT devices. In addition to ECC, the model incorporates Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) for verification, providing a lighter alternative to ECC. ZKP works by signing the input messages and subsequently verifying the data, offering a robust security measure. The implementation strategy involves simulating IoT sensors, each equipped with ECC and Zero Knowledge proof capabilities for enhanced security.

The proposed system is designed to continuously update a medical database fed with vital signs from biosensor kits applied by nurses to elderly people on a daily basis. The database is hosted in the cloud and is managed by a flexible microservices software architecture. The computational paradigms of the edge and the cloud were used in the implementation of a hybrid cloud architecture in order to support versatile high-performance applications under the microservices pattern for the pre-diagnosis of infectious diseases in elderly patients. The results of an analysis of the usability of the equipment, the performance of the architecture and the service concept show that the proposed e-health system is feasible and innovative. The system components are also selected to give a cost-effective implementation for people living in disadvantaged areas. The proposed e-health system is also suitable for distributed computing, big data and NoSQL structures, thus allowing the immediate application of machine learning and AI algorithms to discover knowledge patterns from the overall population.

AB  - The adoption of the Web of Things (WoT) has revolutionized the medical sector by giving rise to a number of easy-to-use solutions. In this context, improving remote patient health monitoring in a hospital is a recurring consideration, due to various difficulties encountered by medical staff during the performance of their duties, such as heavy workload, manual input of patient data, delays in treatments or interventions, and possible human errors (diagnostic, dosage, etc.). For this matter, we propose a platform that allows to permanently monitor the vital signs of hospitalized patients using sensors. Automatic intervention scenarios are developed to provide the necessary treatment to the patient remotely. In case of life-threatening circumstances, the medical staff is alerted by receiving notifications summarizing the patient's condition. Based on a service-oriented architecture (SOA), the successful sequencing of these functionalities depends on the composition of the different Web services exposed by the smart things connected to the Web.

AB  - Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is becoming an essential part of remote health monitoring due to the evolution of medical wireless sensors and intelligent communication technologies. IoT-based healthcare applications are employed in the medical centers to provide continuous health monitoring of a patient. However, recent smart medical devices have limited resources to handle the huge amount of healthcare data. IoMT faces several challenging issues, like security, privacy, anonymity, and interoperability. In data aggregation and communication, the privacy and security of medical information is a demanding task. Therefore, we proposed a suitable scheme to overcome the limitations of existing research studies. This paper presents an Efficient and Secure Data Transmission and Aggregation (ESDTA) scheme to enhance aggregation efficiency and data security. Our proposed work provides secure data aggregation and data forwarding of healthcare parameter values by employing the Secure Message Aggregation (SMA) algorithm and Secure Message Decryption (SMD) algorithm at the Mobile Node (MN) and Fog Node (FN), respectively. From a security perspective, the proposed scheme preserves the data integrity and also protect against several security threats like data fabrication and replay attack. The proposed scenario is simulated through simulation tool NS 2.35. The simulation results prove that aggregation at the MN effectively reduces transmission and communication costs. Furthermore, the effective computation at the FN minimizes the storage and computational cost at the cloud server. Thus, the analysis of the proposed scheme shows the supremacy of our proposed work. We compare our scheme with other related secure data aggregation-based schemes in terms of communication cost, energy consumption, resilience, storage and computational cost.

AB  - Eventually, the ways of interactions among humans, health devices, and healthcare facilities are evolving and becoming smarter and quicker. Wireless wearables unified with IoT are becoming an effective everyday tool to analyze and collect patients' health data and keep a track of the health of those who have a risk of persistent disease. Uninterrupted attendance by the healthcare workers and convenience for the patients during a crisis in remote areas is the primary factor to be addressed by a healthcare monitoring system. Such a system materializes personal medical treatment to rural patients and helps to reduce their medical costs with a constantly enhanced outcome. LoRa due to its wide coverage, offers a concrete framework for IoT that can certainly transform the healthcare trade to the next level yet it encounters some challenges like latency, unbalanced loading of data, and diverseness of the applications and user requests. Healthcare is such a field where even a little delay may cost the life of a patient. Cloud computing has been considered as a base to provide IoT solutions but it too calls for limitations when it comes to distance from the point of origin of IoT data. There is an upsurge of Fog computing solutions, to eradicate such challenges by bringing computation power nearer to the origin of data. Notwithstanding, the cloud-fog-IoT unification and interoperability entail intricate engineering of services and applications so that the solutions can utilize the distributed resources without bargaining the Quality of Service (QoS), privacy, and efficiency.

AB  - Pervasive healthcare services have evolved substantially in the recent years with IoMT rapidly changing the pace and scale of healthcare delivery. A promising application of IoMT is to fetch patterns of mental behaviour symptomatology based on bio-signals and transfer it to the corresponding hospital or psychologist for remote monitoring. But the data volume & performance, device diversity & interoperability, hacking & unauthorized use and acceptance & adoption barriers still restrain the practical and competent use of these devices. This research presents a plausible solution to surmount the data overload and processing latency in real-time sensory data collected through wearable devices for mental health monitoring. We propose a modified k-medoid data clustering technique based on time-frame restricted intra-cluster similarity calculations to obtain a summarized version of the original benchmark WESAD dataset for which the degree of information lost is minimum. A CNN is then trained on this summarized dataset for classification of mental state into the baseline, stress and amusement categories. The results show a significant reduction in the average execution time by 34% with a comparable accuracy to the original dataset, thus offering prompt real-time healthcare analytics.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) for medical purposes offers a number of benefits, including the aptitude to follow the individual's physical state over a range of time intervals and transmitting data in real time. Using gadgets like glucose meters, heart monitoring implants, Electrocardiogram (ECG), blood pressure monitors, Electroencephalography (EEG) and Electromyography (EMG) wearable strategies, medical personnel can gather local patient wellness data and make choices based on it. The IoT devices' weak authentication and encryption procedures make them readily hackable and may expose users to a number of risks, some of which could be fatal. The Quality of Service (QoS) needs for healthcare IoT devices, such as dependability, authorization, identity and security, cannot be met by current algorithms using machine learning or blockchain approaches operating in the cloud computing environment. Henceforth the proposed work develops an advanced Fog computing (FC) to oppose advance cloud computing at an edge of networks together with Block chain topology. Fog computing has been emphasized as promising method for low-cost remote monitoring, limiting down on latency, and boosting efficiency, while blockchain has been touted for guaranteeing the security of private data, building a decentralized database, and improving data interoperability. The problem of healthcare IoT device recognition, permission and confirmation for scalability often broadcast of data in a distributed setting can be handled by merging FC with block chain. So, leveraging FC and blockchain, a creative solution to the aforementioned issue.
