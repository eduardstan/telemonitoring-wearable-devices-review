AB  - Intravenous (IV) therapy provides a rapid therapeutic effect. However, errors in infusion rate can lead to over-dosing and under-dosing, potentially causing severe side effects for patients. To prevent incidents, medical staff visually monitors medication injection information (MIF) such as current flow rates (CFR) and injection volume. In this study, we propose an internet of things (IoT) system that automatically controls the CFR and remotely monitors the MIF. First, a peristaltic pump is designed to infuse parenteral fluids based on the “drop-by-drop” phenomenon. Second, a computer vision-based on deep learning algorithm provides real-time video and counts the fluid dropping to derive the MIF. Finally, the CFR is automatically applied as a feedback signal to regulate the infusion cycle of the peristaltic pump. After embedding all systems in our prototype, we evaluate the system performance according to IV therapy protocols used in clinical practice. In our experiments, the mean accuracy of the fluid injection using the peristaltic pump was 99.23% and the dropping count was the highest at 98.25%. Furthermore, the average accuracy of the CFR using the feedback system was 99.3%. Based on our results, we confirmed that automated control of infusion rate is possible in IV therapy and computer vision-based on deep learning can be utilized for feedback sensors and monitoring system. Therefore, we believe that our method is the practical solution that can increase patient safety and work efficiency of clinical staffs.

AB  - Continuous rhythm monitoring using wearable devices is a potential tool for early identification of atrial fibril-lation (AF), the most frequent cardiac arrhythmia (with 0,51% worldwide prevalence, increasing with time), and is also a tool for remote monitoring patients after cardiac surgery. However, AF detection directly through wearable devices is limited by the computational complexity of the classifier model. In this work we propose a lightweight AF classifier model based on the VGG-11 architecture (Lite VGG-11), focusing on reducing the number of parameters and nu-merical operations. Using a low number of filters, depth-wise separable convolution, and global pooling, this model has only 20,454 parameters and needs 6.9 MFLOP to make an inference for an input of 10 seconds of the ECG leads I and II, sampled at 200 Hz. To test its effectiveness for AF detection we used the PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2021 public dataset, stratifying the classes into sinus rhythm, AF, and other rhythms. After 10 Monte Carlo cross-validation splits, with 24,260 unbalanced samples for training and 1,536 balanced samples for validation and testing, the observed met-rics (mean±standard deviation) were: Se 94.1±0.1%; Sp 91.9±0.8%; F1-Score 89.50.7±%; and AUC 96.1±0.6%.

AB  - In today's technological climate, users require fast automation and digitization of results for large amounts of data at record speeds. Especially in the field of medicine, where each patient is often asked to undergo many different examinations within one diagnosis or treatment. Each examination can help in the diagnosis or prediction of further disease progression. Furthermore, all produced data from these examinations must be stored somewhere and available to various medical practitioners for analysis who may be in geographically diverse locations. The current medical climate leans towards remote patient monitoring and AI-assisted diagnosis. To make this possible, medical data should ideally be secured and made accessible to many medical practitioners, which makes them prone to malicious entities. Medical information has inherent value to malicious entities due to its privacy-sensitive nature in a variety of ways. Furthermore, if access to data is distributively made available to AI algorithms (particularly neural networks) for further analysis/diagnosis, the danger to the data may increase (e.g., model poisoning with fake data introduction). In this paper, we propose a federated learning approach that uses decentralized learning with blockchain-based security and a proposition that accompanies that training intelligent systems using distributed and locally-stored data for the use of all patients. Our work in progress hopes to contribute to the latest trend of the Internet of Medical Things security and privacy.

AB  - The Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a useful diagnostic tool to diagnose cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Standard 12-Lead ECG setup is most commonly used by doctors for the diagnosis. But the promising type of wearable ECG device uses minimal wire setup on the body to increase patients' comfort resulting in fewer recorded leads, mainly single lead. There is a need to reconstruct the remaining leads from these less recorded leads. Accounting for this, we are proposing a novel Single Lead to 12-Lead ECG reconstruction methodology using convolution neural networks (CNN) and long short term memory (LSTM). In the proposed methodology, lead-II is taken as the basis lead to reconstruct the remaining independent leads (I, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, and V6). Seven individual models corresponding to the above mentioned seven independent leads have been trained, where each model takes lead-II as input and gives I/V1/V2/V3/V4/V5/V6 as output. Leads III, aVR, aVL, and aVF are reconstructed using a standard approach using original lead II and reconstructed lead I signals, without the need for deep learning models. The proposed methodology was evaluated on myocardial infarction data from PTBDB using R2 statistics, correlation coefficient, and regression coefficient. The mean values averaged across all the 11 leads of the stated performance metrics obtained were 93.62%, 0.973, and 0.959, respectively.

AB  - Emerging eHealth tools including wearable technology and telemedicine are becoming increasingly popular. This advancement revolutionizes the early detection and management of diseases such as Parkinson Disease (PD). Due to the loss of dopamine-producing neurons, PD is a progressive central nervous system condition that affects fundamental motor abilities, with hand tremors often being the first symptom. Despite the importance of early diagnosis, there is currently no conclusive test for PD. In our work, we consider a diagnostic tool for the early detection and diagnosis of PD by analyzing hand-drawn spiral and wave patterns. Hence, we aim in our model to automate the PD $\mathbf{s}$ early diagnosis. This innovation opens up a realm of possibilities, particularly in enabling remote monitoring and timely intervention. In this paper, we use two deep learning models, Inception V3 and Xception, to predict the risk of PD based on the pattern of the drawings. The models were trained on augmented data consisting of more than 4500 images. Our diagnostic tool achieves an accuracy rate of 97% which ultimately improves the lives of countless individuals battling this challenging condition.

AB  - In the context of smart environments, crafting remote monitoring systems that are efficient, cost-effective, user-friendly, and respectful of privacy is crucial for many scenarios. Recognizing and tracing individuals via markerless motion capture systems in multi-person settings poses challenges due to obstructions, varying light conditions, and intricate interactions among subjects. In contrast, methods based on data gathered by Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) located in wearables grapple with other issues, including the precision of the sensors and their optimal placement on the body. We claim that more accurate results can be achieved by mixing Human Pose Estimation (HPE) techniques with information collected by wearables. To do that, we introduce a real-time platform that fuses HPE and IMU data to track and identify people. It exploits a matching model that consists of two synergistic components: the first employs a geometric approach, correlating orientation, acceleration, and velocity readings from the input sources. The second utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to yield a correlation coefficient for each HPE and IMU data pair. The proposed platform achieves promising results in identification and tracking, with an accuracy rate of 96.9%.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) based smart health and wellness systems are increasingly gaining popularity for the next generation of medical services. Systems of medical devices that communicate seamlessly integrated and securely can improve patient outcomes, reduce medical errors, lower costs and overcome the existing medical systems limitations. While these innovative medical systems are emerging, they also bring new challenges as data protection and power management. This paper proposes an IoT architecture that allows to collect and analyze huge volumes of heterogeneous clinical data in order to monitor health status of patients and improve clinical decision support, by tackling the energy shortage challenge. The key feature of the proposed approach is a power-aware strategy based on energy load balancing in order to keep on the greatest number of power operated devices involved in the computational tasks. The paper presents a case study of power-aware smart health monitoring exploiting different types of data mining techniques. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the approach able to achieve energy savings by means of the proposed power-aware strategy.

AB  - In some Emergency Situations, Patients must be monitored continuously and treated for. However, going to the hospital to perform such work is challenging due to time restraints. A virtual care monitoring system can help with this. With the rising use of cloud computing, the suggested system presents an efficient data science technique for IoT enabled healthcare monitoring systems that improve the productivity of data processing and the use of data in the cloud. IoT sensors in plenty are used to gather health care data. For the purposes of science processing, these data are stored in the cloud. An altered data science technique is initially introduced in the Healthcare Monitoring - Data Science Technique (HM-DST). The Upgraded Pigeon Optimization (IPO) technique is used to arrange the data that is kept in the cloud, which helps to increase prediction accuracy. The best method for selecting features is then illustrated for the removal and features selection. In order to analyze human healthcare, a backtracking search-based deep neural network (BS-DNN) is used. The performance of our system is then assessed using various real-time healthcare datasets, and changes are observed using the current smart healthcare monitoring systems. To assist the medical community in early detection of a patient’s primary organs’ health status, allowing for proper treatment, as well as to securely store patient health data in the cloud. The goal of the project is to demonstrate how the sensory system can be used to track a patient’s movement invisibly.

AB  - Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a crucial role in numerous applications, ranging from healthcare to sports analytics. This study presents a novel approach to HAR that combines Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Random Forests to enhance the accuracy of HAR in diverse real-world conditions, especially when dealing with noisy and imperfect data. ANNs are known for extracting intricate features from raw data, making them well-suited for classification. Random Forest excels at learning from multiple decision trees and utilizing collective knowledge to make predictions, making it suitable for handling data in real-world applications. Harnessing the power of ANNs in feature extraction, coupled with the collective decision-making capability of Random Forest, the combined model demonstrates improved accuracy in classifying human activities. This study showcases the potential of combining ANN and Random Forest in classifying multi-dimensional Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data, a widely-used data source in HAR. By leveraging the strengths of both ANN and Random Forest, the combined model addresses the challenges associated with real, imperfect data, leading to a more robust and accurate classification model. The results highlight the effectiveness of feature extraction by ANNs and underscore the importance of incorporating Random Forest in HAR systems to obtain 98.84% accuracy. The findings of this study offer valuable insights into the synergistic effects of combining ANN and Random Forest for HAR. The outcomes can contribute to developing more reliable and effective HAR systems, with potential applications in healthcare monitoring, activity recognition in smart environments, and other domains requiring accurate human activity classification.

AB  - Continuous healthcare monitoring is a prevalent need for the spinal cord injured (SCI) population to mitigate the risk of secondary health conditions and develop preventive methods. In this paper, we developed an embodied system for remote monitoring and classification of activities of daily living (ADL). We propose a framework for sensor transfer learning to recognize these activities from simple and short samples through label transferring from a deep SlowFast network on video data. Multiple wearable devices were included and synchronized in this study to capture physiological data as well as posture and movement from acceleration and pressure distribution. Furthermore, we propose a pipeline of data capturing for automatically creating a ground truth dataset of different ADLs. Results from a pilot training with eight users in 15 minutes task recordings over eight different tasks produced a weighted accuracy on F1-score of 77% in correctly classifying ADLs. Although extending the data is required to increase precision, we showed a successful method for monitoring and classification of specific activities in SCI with up to 91% in accuracy. Further work will focus on extending to multi-class soft labelling for achieving usability in complex situations.

AB  - Ubiquitous devices, such as smartphones and wearables, are becoming increasingly popular for monitoring user behavior, health, and well-being. Through omnipresent monitoring, they aim to raise user awareness and encourage positive health behavior change. Yet, ubiquitous technologies suffer from expectation mismatch, lack of user-centric adaptiveness, and, ultimately, high abandonment rates. This work is motivated by the vital need to tailor and personalize ubiquitous technologies while dealing with the challenges arising from the lack of user profiling and the absence of relevant, self-reported user data. To this end, we show that the automatically passively collected sensing data from the wearables can be exploited to improve personalization and infer several user states relevant to demographic, physiological, psychological, and personality aspects, complementing the need for time-consuming self-reports. To accomplish this task, and enable the reproducibility and extensibility of our work; we propose an extensive benchmark suite by exploiting sensing data harvested from ubiquitous devices.Our benchmark covers a wide range of personalization tasks, including modeling gender, age, personality states, and stress, experimenting on the publicly available, newly released LifeSnaps dataset containing over 71 million rows of data capturing the daily lives of 71 participants in their naturalistic environments. The proposed benchmarking continuum showcases the strong potential for the applicability of the presented work in critical applications, such as mental healthcare monitoring, privacy preservation, and responsible artificial intelligence (AI), by fostering fairness assessments when protected attribute knowledge is unavailable.

AB  - Environmental optical sensors equipped with Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be useful in improving care for residents in long-term care and Nursing Homes (NHs). When strategically placed in the rooms, sensors can signal behaviors related to agitation or mental confusion, allowing healthcare professionals to act promptly and safely to prevent adverse events, such as falls. Although Italy ranks second in the international panorama for studies on AI-enabled devices in care settings, studies have yet to be conducted in real-world settings. The project's general objective is to describe and evaluate the use of an environmental optical AI sensor, enabled with a camera monitoring system, in a NH in Piedmont. This paper aims to describe and assess the implementation of an AI environmental optical sensor, enabled with a camera monitoring system, in a NH, highlighting barriers and facilitators encountered.

AB  - Estimation of muscle excitations from a reduced sensor array could greatly improve current techniques in remote patient monitoring. Such an approach could allow continuous monitoring of clinically relevant biomechanical variables that are ideal for personalizing rehabilitation. In this paper, we introduce the notion of a muscle synergy function which describes the synergistic relationship between a subset of muscles. We develop from first principles an approximation to their behavior using Gaussian process regression and demonstrate the utility of the technique for estimating the excitation time-series of leg muscles during normal walking for nine healthy subjects. Specifically, excitations for six muscles were estimated using surface electromyography (sEMG) data during a finite time interval (called the input window) from four different muscles (called the input muscles) with mean absolute error (MAE) less than 5.0% of the maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) and that accounts for 82-88% of the variance (VAF) in the true excitations. Further, these estimated excitations informed muscle activations with less than 4.0% MAE and 89-93% VAF. We also present a detailed analysis of a number of different modeling choices, including every possible combination of four-, three- and two-muscle input sets, the size and structure of the input window, and the stationarity of the Gaussian process covariance functions. Further, application specific modifications for future use are discussed. The proposed technique lays a foundation to explore the use of reduced wearable sensor arrays and muscle synergy functions for monitoring clinically relevant biomechanics during daily life.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) has firmly established itself as a popular technology. It strives to make it easier for people across domains to live an “Easy & Smart” lifestyle. Machine vision and artificial intelligence (AI) are the sources of the idea of image recognition. Chronic illnesses, a catch-all phrase for conditions including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, other types of dementia, cardiovascular disorders, and more, are on the rise. They come with challenges relating to ongoing supervision, care, and aid. Not everyone is prepared to handle the financial and ethical issues involving patients and their caretakers. Wearable IoT devices and AI offer a potential quick aid for dependable remote monitoring and help through ambient medical aid without jeopardizing the patient's confidentiality or privacy. The proposed work seeks to design a prototype that is inexpensive and provides pleasant patient healthcare. Concerning Alzheimer's, applications and IoT and AI devices are used to create a long-term fix. The patient will be able to recognize familiar people around them and capture knowledge for future reminders with the use of the proposed wearable camera-aided device in conjunction with a Bluetooth ear-complementary device. The AI component triggers constant reminders, which helps the patient stay more aware of their surroundings & situation.

AB  - Remote patient monitoring aspect of Healthcare 4.0 has revolutionized the way we pursue medical treatment. Integration of Medical Internet of Things (MIoT), patient centric healthcare devices and remote robotic equipment has vanished the separative line between physical onsite monitoring and remote monitoring. Secure use of available network to handle this critical patient data is one of the major concern raised due to this methodology. To mitigate this paramount concern Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can be utilized to detect in malicious activity or manipulation occurred on incoming data. Though use of ML algorithms along with conventional feature extraction technique brings performance saturation challenge and creates a black-box in this highly complex communication environment. To overcome this drawback, we propose X-NET, an eXplainable Artificial Intelligent (X-AI) based network data security approach for Healthcare 4.0 applications. For comparison purpose we have used five different types of tradition feature extraction techniques along with Naive Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (LR) and Perception. Utilization of X-AI algorithms such as LIME and SHAP has significantly boosted the overall performance and reliability of X-NET. Performance evolution of our proposed approach has been done through various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, Receiver Operating Characteristic and Precision-Recall Trade-off. Thus, X-NET contributes in defining secured, reliable and robust remote patient monitoring scheme for Healthcare 4.0.

AB  - Given the developing pervasiveness of constant sicknesses and the maturing of the populace, far off wellbeing monitoring is fundamental for giving better therapy at lower costs. The IoT has of late acquired consideration as a potential answer for distant wellbeing monitoring. Medical specialists might get real-time criticism from IoT-based gadgets after they gather and assess physiological information, for example, blood oxygen levels, pulses, internal heat levels, and ECG signals. To work on remote monitoring and early sickness ID in home medical services settings, this study recommends a Web of Things-based arrangement. The MQTT convention is utilized to send the information to a server. Potential diseases are ordered utilizing a server-side deep learning model that was pre-prepared utilizing a convolutional brain organization and a consideration layer. Utilizing ECG sensor information and either a fever or non-fever from the internal heat level, the framework can recognize five kinds of unpredictable pulses: Typical Beat, Supraventricular untimely beat, Untimely ventricular constriction, Combination of ventricular, and Unclassifiable Beat.

AB  - As the population ages, this will put tremendous pressure on pensions and the medical system. Health insurance for the elderly poses a major challenge to the allocation of limited medical resources. The Internet of Things (IoT) is widely regarded as a potential solution to relieve pressure on healthcare systems. With the rapid development of wireless communication technologies such as backscatter communication, Wi-Fi and 5G, in vivo and in vitro medical devices have been greatly developed. In this article, we propose a real-time big data healthcare analysis system based on the combination of shallow neural networks and deep neural networks. The system consists of two parts: the detection of fog layer abnormality based on shallow neural network and the diagnosis of cloud disease based on deep neural network. The system can not only make full use of the real-time nature of the fog layer but also give full play to its powerful computing power based on reducing the computing pressure of the cloud layer.

AB  - Digital twin (DT), referring to a promising technique to digitally and accurately represent actual physical entities, has attracted explosive interests from both academia and industry. One typical advantage of DT is that it can be used to not only virtually replicate a system’s detailed operations but also analyze the current condition, predict the future behavior, and refine the control optimization. Although DT has been widely implemented in various fields, such as smart manufacturing and transportation, its conventional paradigm is limited to embody non-living entities, e.g., robots and vehicles. When adopted in human-centric systems, a novel concept, called human digital twin (HDT) has thus been proposed. Particularly, HDT allows in silico representation of individual human body with the ability to dynamically reflect molecular status, physiological status, emotional and psychological status, as well as lifestyle evolutions. These prompt the expected application of HDT in personalized healthcare (PH), which can facilitate the remote monitoring, diagnosis, prescription, surgery and rehabilitation, and hence significantly alleviate the heavy burden on the traditional healthcare system. However, despite the large potential, HDT faces substantial research challenges in different aspects, and becomes an increasingly popular topic recently. In this survey, with a specific focus on the networking architecture and key technologies for HDT in PH applications, we first discuss the differences between HDT and the conventional DTs, followed by the universal framework and essential functions of HDT. We then analyze its design requirements and challenges in PH applications. After that, we provide an overview of the networking architecture of HDT, including data acquisition layer, data communication layer, computation layer, data management layer and data analysis and decision making layer. Besides reviewing the key technologies for implementing such networking architecture in detail, we conclude this survey by presenting future research directions of HDT.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) has made it possible to diagnose and treat patients remotely, as well as to expedite the transportation of essential drugs and medical equipment to locations that are geographically separated. This has occurred at a time when society has become more socially distant. During the Ebola and COVID-19 outbreaks, the Internet of Things (IoT) technology was put to use in remote patient monitoring and the management of the vaccine cold chain. Concurrently, this study reflects on the variables that are required for IoT to scale. Since December 2019, the COVID-19 outbreak on a worldwide scale has developed into a significant problem. In order for medical treatment to be successful, it is essential to make a prompt and accurate diagnosis of persons who may be infected with the COVID-19 virus. In order to put a halt to the spread of COVID-19, it is important to construct an automated system that is based on deep transfer learning and is capable of detecting the virus based on chest X-rays. The authors of this study present an internet-of-things (IoT) system that makes use of ensemble deep transfer learning to diagnose COVID-19 patients at an earlier stage.

AB  - A methodology for daily physical activity tracking, detection, and classification is proposed using wearable ultrawideband (UWB) technology. The compact UWB antennas act as sensors to provide useful information and metrics regarding the activity, derived from channel information (path loss and rms delay spread) and received signal features. The activities consist of daily activities, such as walking, sitting, running, opening/closing door, and ascending/descending stairs, which are considered as main activities in everyday life. Experimental validation is carried out showing effective tracking capabilities based on the interdistance variation, giving an estimate of the range of movement during various phases of the activity cycle. The computation of patterns of different daily activities cycle provides unique recognition/classification characteristics, which have been validated through template-based and machine learning techniques. The proposed method provides high accuracy, is cost-effective, and has low computation complexity, making it suitable for various healthcare applications, such as elderly/remote monitoring, rehabilitation, patient activity tracking, and general fitness.

Because data is so valuable, improving strategies for intelligently having to manage the now-ubiquitous content infrastructures is a necessary part of the process toward completely autonomous agents. Computer vision and computer vision have improved a wide range of industries, including medical diagnoses, data display and procedures, science and research, and so on A number of tiny IoT devices on the market for heart rate sensor, allowing patients to roam about freely while their hearts are continually monitored. It is still difficult to guarantee ultra-accurate findings, however most current instruments can achieve accuracy rates of over 90 percentage... Monitoring cardiac rhythms, as well as glucose levels, may be challenging, and even those who are represented at medical institutions. Intermittent heart rate assessments cannot protect against sudden changes in vital signs, and standard techniques of heart rhythm surveillance used in hospitals require patients to be permanently attached to wired apparatus, limiting their mobility.

AB  - Gait evaluation is important for apprehension and management of different neurocognitive disorders (NCD). The gait events are changing with the age factor and this variability is being incorrectly linked with people with NCD. So, there is a high need to analyze gait events correctly. The gait analysis is mostly performed on temporal and spectral feature extraction in which there is a high rate of missing important features. Apart from this, monitoring and quantification of Parkinson's disease patients raise many therapeutic challenges in terms of severity analysis of motor symptoms i.e. freezing of gait (FOG), bradykinesia and continuous remote monitoring of patients. The objective of this study is to use a smart insole dataset for the assessment of computational techniques focusing on gait evaluation. The objective of this research study is to use continuous wavelet transform to convert time series signals into an images instead of using more traditional techniques for dealing with time series based on e.g. recurrent architectures. The results evidence that the proposed system works efficiently with the accuracy of 96.5% in gait variability analyzing three cohorts i.e. adults, elderly, and patients with Parkinson's disease (PwPD) and 91% for analyzing the gait symptoms in different severity stages of PD patients.

AB  - The surge in popularity of wireless headphones, particularly wireless earbuds, as smart wearables, has been notable in recent years. These devices, empowered by artificial intelligence (AI), are broadening their utility in areas such as speech recognition, augmented reality, pose recognition, and health care monitoring, thereby enriching user experiences through novel interactive interfaces driven by embedded sensors. However, the widespread adoption of wireless earbuds has spurred concerns regarding security and privacy, necessitating robust bespoke security measures. Despite the miniaturization of mobile chips enabling the integration of sophisticated algorithms into smart wearables, the research and industrial communities have yet to accord adequate attention to earbud security. This article focuses on empowering wireless earbuds to authenticate their legitimate users, tackling the challenges associated with conventional authentication methods. Instead of relying on input interface authentication methods like PIN or lock patterns, this research delves into leveraging inertial measurement unit (IMU) data collected during interactions with devices to extract novel biometric features, presenting an alternative approach that nonetheless confronts challenges related to signal capture and interference. Consequently, we propose and design BudsAuth, an implicit user authentication framework that harnesses built-in IMU sensors in smart earbuds to capture vibration signals induced by on-face touching interactions with the earbuds. These vibrations are utilized to deliver continuous and implicit user authentication with high precision and compatibility across various earbud models. Extensive evaluation demonstrates BudsAuth’s capability to achieve an equal error rate (EER) of 0.0003, representing an approximate 99.97% accuracy with seven consecutive samples of interactive gestures for implicit authentication.

AB  - The degeneration of nerve cells, which causes Parkinson's disease, a prevalent neurodegenerative ailment that typically affects elderly people, inhibits everyday function, and hinders mobility. Unintentional shivering and hand tremors are early symptoms that make it difficult to do daily tasks like eating. Caretakers find it difficult to supervise patients remotely. Using IoT and sensor network concepts, including ML prediction, our study intends to develop a stabilising spoon and a health monitoring system. The stabilising spoon maintains the bowl's stability by adjusting to the user's shakes or shivers by aligning its head with these forces. With a gyroscope to monitor motion angles and an accelerometer to measure motion speed, we created a prototype device to improve the patient's feeding process. Our project also entails keeping track of the patient's temperature, Spo2 levels, and heart rate while sending the data to a mobile app for status updates. Early on, there were numerous patients, few physicians were available, and significant medical equipment was used in ICUs and other special care units, necessitating the attendance of one nurse or doctor for every patient in various wards. As a result, the patient could not be continually watched, leading to the development of the following issue formulation. The conventional, large-sized medical test equipment. The patient couldn't be located and assisted in time. Extended patient monitoring. Every patient needs human interaction. A lack of readily available medical equipment. It was difficult to continually verify everything. Due to a dearth of specialists and equipment, the majority of patients perished. This study aimed to identify the requirements of medical physicians for wireless patient monitoring. The system uses plug-in analytic components to handle data, and these components may be quickly combined into plans using a graphical programming environment.

AB  - As a vital sign of human, ballistocardiography (BCG) signal is widely used to indicate the health status of an individual. It can be captured by optical fiber sensor in a non-invasive way. Besides, some significant physiological information, such as heart rate (HR) and respiration rate (RR), can also be extracted from BCG signal. As a medical instrument characterized by low power consumption, no interference, no invasion and the capability of real-time health monitoring, optical fiber sensor provides an effective solution to health care monitoring. However, when long-term monitoring of HR and RR is required for patients, it is necessary to collect a large amount of BCG data, which incurs a considerable amount of time and labor costs. To solve this problem, a novel deep learning model is proposed in this paper, namely ELA. Long-short term memory (LSTM) has the capability to memorize long-distance information states. According to this method, the improved empirical mode decomposition (EMD) algorithm (VEMD) is applied to convert the complex problem of HR and RR time series prediction into multiple sub-problems with relatively simple intrinsic mode function (IMF) component sequence prediction. Then, the proposed ELA model is adopted to model the HR and RR sub-sequences decomposed by VEMD. Accordingly, the results of IMF component subsequence prediction are obtained, with all the prediction results linearly summed to obtain the final prediction result. Moreover, experimental results are obtained to demonstrate the superiority of ELA and the R2 is 0.9946, indicating the excellent performance of the proposed model in the assessment and prediction of vital signs.

AB  - Advanced analytics are becoming more important in telehealth environments as the number of connected devices continues to rise, necessitating the collection of massive amounts of time-series patient data. This system uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks in telemedicine that are linked to the Internet of Things (IoT), with an emphasis on accurate longitudinal monitoring of patient behavior. An extensive dataset gathered from IoT devices that track several health metrics in real-time is used in the research. LSTM networks are used to detect patterns and relationships in time-series data using a deep learning technique. In turn, this allows the system to analyze patient behavior with more precision and speed. IoT provides seamless connections for real-time data transfer it offers continuous monitoring within the telehealth framework. The LSTM-based model improves our comprehension of patient behavior, which in turn enables us to spot outliers, forecast health trends, and provide individualized healthcare recommendations. Through its demonstration of LSTM networks' usefulness in the context of IoT-connected telehealth settings, the study makes a valuable contribution to the rapidly growing area of digital health. Accurate time-series analysis has the ability to improve patient monitoring, early intervention, and healthcare outcomes, as shown by the results.

AB  - In the midst of a global health crisis, it is of utmost importance for healthcare technologies to possess the capability to regulate and monitor the physiological variables of patients remotely and automatically. The effective control of mean arterial pressure (MAP) in a closed-loop manner is particularly critical for individuals who are critically ill or in the process of recovering from surgical procedures. Within the framework of the present research, an adaptive closed-loop structure has been formulated with the objective of controlling a patient’s MAP through governed administration of the medication sodium nitroprusside (SNP), to attain the desired MAP levels under varying conditions. The proposed closed-loop technique incorporates an intelligent controller known as the active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) with the intention of tracking the desired MAP value, alongside the utilization of continuous action policy gradient (CAPG) for the optimization of the controller’s coefficients. Under the DRL strategy, an actor is responsible for generating policy requests, while a critic assesses the efficacy of the actor’s policy directives. This approach uses gradient descent to train the weight values of both actor and critic networks, and it is dependent on the reward return linked to the MAP fault. Upon comparing the outcomes of the recommended structure with conventional models, numerical simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed system in coping with varying working conditions, key-value fluctuations, and uncertainties, while effectively maintaining the desired mean arterial pressure and drug administration rate.

AB  - Due to the expanding growth of populations worldwide, infectious disease expenses are increasing rapidly. Patients with lesser chronic health problems are often encouraged to recover at home, which requires continuous remote monitoring and recommendation systems for decision-making. To overcome the above-mentioned challenges and reduce connectivity between infected patients and medical officers, we develop an artificial intelligence (AI)-based healthcare prototype in edge networks to monitor and analyze health parameters remotely. In the first phase of the work, health parameters are collected through multiple biosensors, including temperature, pulse rate, and oxygen saturation, and stored at the edge of the network. In the second phase, the monitoring data are preprocessed and analyzed using the neural network (NN) model in the edge devices for decision-making about the health status of the infected patient. Finally, the performance of the proposed model is evaluated using a real-time dataset, and multiple performance metrics are collected from the developed prototype to assess its effectiveness. The extensive simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed model over the existing ML models, i.e., the NN model achieves 94.05% accuracy, which is higher than the existing ones.

AB  - The health care sector is focusing on in-home health care services, where the patients can receive medical care in the privacy of their own home. A patient in a rural region can use a remote health monitoring system to communicate with a doctor in a city who is in a larger city. Machine learning has been used for smart health monitoring systems. They used a wearable sensor to identify a set of five parameters, including Electrocardiogram (ECG), pulse rate, pressure, temperature, and position detection. The technology uses machine learning algorithms to identify doctors for consultation and to identify and predict ailments. In the study, IoT technology and health monitoring have been coupled to give more personalized and responsive health care. The primary purpose of the system is to monitor patients' vital signs in real-time monitoring. The authorized individual can access the patient' s vital signs from their smartphone or PC using a cloud server. The Decision Tree (DT) attained the best accuracy of 99.1 percent after testing the suggested model, which is promising for their purposes. It is observed that the DT achieves best accuracy, while Random Forest is the second-best classifier for this problem.

AB  - Continuously monitoring and tracking of patient health data can be a daunting task in a hospital. However, some people require regular monitoring due to physiological needs in order to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Especially for the elderly and those who have been in a coma for a long time, it is critical to regularly measure and inform their loved ones' wellness at work. This research work proposed an innovative LoRa-loT-based intelligent healthcare system using Artificial intelligence. All patients' healthcare data can be transmitted to Cloud through the LoRA transceiver. Also, the bed up/down can be controlled through Online Voice Command using Artificial Intelligence. An intelligent hospital health remote control system has been proposed to monitor patients' health at a hospital and acquire a doctor's prescription. Doctors can also identify patients' illnesses using data collected remotely from them. Android-based mobile applications are utilized as an interface for web-based applications to execute effective real-time communication involving doctors and patients using LoRA-IoT. This approach uses five sensors to collect data from the hospital environment: a heart rate sensor, a body temperature sensor, a room-temperature sensor, a CO sensor, and a max30100 sensor. Incorporating specific functions in mobile intelligent hospital automation equipment enables remote monitoring at the hospital and makes life more comfortable. As a result, patients who have caused self-isolation or self-isolation can use one of the most significant variables, the mobile phone, to convey their daily health symptoms and difficulties to their doctor. As a result, it will be able to enhance patient health and live a more pleasant life.

AB  - Time is very crucial in Internet of Things (IoT)-based healthcare applications and any delay can lead to dangerous scenarios, including patient deaths. The Earliest Deadline First (EDF) scheduling mechanism has been recommended for use in IoT-based applications in healthcare systems. However, the EDF performs poorly under overloaded conditions since priority is given to high-priority packets with close deadlines. In order to overcome the limitation of EDF, models for the prioritized scheduling (PS) scheme was proposed. The PS scheme is an improvement of the EDF scheme for IoT-based healthcare applications. The PS scheme uses a heterogeneous multi-server priority queuing system to provide service differentiation by prioritizing short packets over large packets and delay sensitive packets are serviced before delay tolerant packets. In this paper, the analytical models of the PS scheduling scheme are validated using the Simulink MATLAB R2023b tool. The performance measures are obtained for the mean slowdown for delay sensitive and delay tolerant packets as a function of the sizes of packets. In addition, the performance measures in terms of throughput as a function of packet sizes for short and large delay sensitive packets are obtained. We compare the results obtained from simulations with the analytical results for mean slowdown and throughput. Simulation results.

AB  - Identifying correct human postures is crucial in areas, such as patient care, in hospitals. However, the traditional vision-based methods widely used for this purpose raise privacy concerns for the subject, and the other wearable sensor-based approaches are impractical for real-world scenarios. In this article, we propose a contactless, privacy-conscious, and memory-efficient posture classification system based on a millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar. This system utilizes 3-D point-cloud data captured using Texas Instrument’s IWR1843BOOST frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar module to classify the posture of the subject. Two types of datasets are extracted from these radar data: 1) image dataset derived from the isometric view of the point-cloud data and 2) spatial coordinates dataset also extracted from the point-cloud data. A low-computational tiny machine learning (TinyML) model is employed on the datasets for efficient implementation on embedded hardware, Raspberry Pi 3 B+. The proposed model’s parameters were quantized to 8 bits (int8), which accurately classify four postures, i.e., standing, sitting, lying, and bending, with an accuracy of 98.97% for the image data. However, to make it more computationally efficient, the int8 quantized TinyML model was trained on the spatial coordinates dataset, giving an accuracy of 96.12%. This highlights the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed lightweight model that can be deployed on edge devices for real-world applications.

AB  - The conventional healthcare system needs more human intervention with healthcare devices, equipment, and patient monitoring. Healthcare is therefore going through an expeditious shift from a conventional hospital and expert-centered way to a dispersed patient-centered way. Healthcare issues are regularly filled by the advancement in technologies like artificial intelligence, 5G, machine learning, Internet of Things (IoT), etc. IoT is a current originating technology used by healthcare service providers to facilitate patients by using smart gadgets and advanced software to improve and monitor the health of the person. These smart healthcare devices produce enormous quantities of data. To increase the overall device efficiency in terms of bandwidth, end-to-end delay, latency, etc., it requires special attention to handle such a large data. Present networking systems such as 4G and other standards of communication are unable to accommodate a large amount of data effectively. 5G networks are prominent to support the explicit communication requirements of healthcare functions in IoT. The launch of 5G in smart healthcare networks is therefore a boom for IoT devices that provides an enhancement in network performance and expend cellular coverage. This paper reviewed several aspects of 5G and IoT architectures. Also, this research work presents the future aspects of 5G-IoT based smart healthcare system architecture, which provides better healthcare for patients in the future.

AB  - This article presents the design and implementation of an Internet of Things (IoT)-based remote health monitoring system for the estimation of blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and blood oxygen saturation levels (SpO2). Our designed sensor can remotely monitor BP, HR, and SpO2. Our device collects, evaluates, predicts, and reads health data and then stores it on a remote platform named “ThinkSpeak,” which forms an IoT platform, with a 0.91 organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) screen display for viewing numerical health readings locally. We used a biomedical sensor device with an embedded signal condition unit, and a single photoplethysmography (PPG) signal was employed to derive and measure the PPG signal. A computer-based algorithm was generated, which factored in selected beneficial parameters measured from a single bio-inspired PPG signal. The measured PPG signal was used to estimate the individual user’s BP (both systolic and diastolic values), HR, and SpO2. An automatic multiscale-based peak (AMBP) detection algorithm was developed to obtain the maximum peak of the PPG signal. Furthermore, the developed sensor was benchmarked against two standard commercially available measurement devices: a Contec ambulatory BP sensor and a Braun pulse oximeter monitor. Our developed sensor is worn as a ring sensor and is interfaced with an Arduino 1010 WIFI MKR for remote health monitoring. Our estimated BP, HR, and SpO2 values were remotely monitored and a graphical representation was constructed.

AB  - Medical sensors and distributed edge networks hold promise in advanced control and prediction of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19. Their integration can lower communication latency, bandwidth utilization, and energy consumption while achieving high application scalability and reliability. Existing edge-devices-enabled e-healthcare frameworks face two serious challenges that affect their success. First, real-time medical sensors generate similar or redundant readings used for disease prediction, mostly for non-COVID-19 patients, which increases data transmission latency and energy consumption. Second, predicting the risk level of COVID-19 patients using lightweight machine learning requires minimal training time to be useful. To address these challenges, we develop an edge-centric e-healthcare framework for online health data monitoring and analysis to predict the risk level of COVID-19 patients. In the proposed framework, a statistical data aggregation method (MEAN function) is deployed at local gateway devices to remove redundant data to minimize communication latency and energy usage. Geo-distributed edge servers are used to predict with 97 percent accuracy the risk level to each patient with Random Forest (RF) on the aggregated data. Finally, the efficiency of the RF algorithm is demonstrated with standard classification techniques.

AB  - Smart homecare utilises advanced technologies to support, improve and promote remote healthcare in homes and communities through collecting and analysing health data and sharing this knowledge with carers and clinicians. With the continuous growth in the world’s older population, smart homecare becomes increasingly crucial in providing in-home care for older adults, allowing the vital healthcare dollars to go further into other critical care needs. In addition, with the rise in the development and utilisation of innovative technologies in healthcare settings, it is vital to ensure that these technologies are guided and approved by the corresponding regulatory bodies such as FDA (Foods and Drug Administration) in the USA and TGA (Therapeutic Good Administration) in Australia. With this premise, this paper identifies four dimensions for researchers to consider when developing smart homecare solutions for in-home remote care: Technology, Data, People, and Operational Environment. The essential interplays amongst these four dimensions are discussed to identify the various enablers and barriers in the successful delivery of smart homecare solutions. As the primary output of this paper, it proposes a conceptual framework to achieve practical in-home care for the older population living independently with the support of technology, while addressing the challenges such as security and privacy of patient data. Secondly, a comprehensive and practical guide featuring seven phases is presented to support and direct researchers in implementing smart homecare solutions for remote care. The proposed framework and the guide aim to make smart homecare research practical and truly translational into broader practice.

AB  - Fall detection systems are important instruments for senior citizens whether they are in a hospital, at home, or in a senior living facility. Existing fall detection systems are often passive and require pushbutton to alarm care providers. The delay can cause significant consequences and damages to the patients. Early detection is vital for quick recovery and prevention of post injuries. Recent sensory detections often use pre-settings to predict fall, hence can cause false alarms. Further, they often cannot furnish vital information for treatment. A smart fall detection system can alleviate those concerns and pinpoint what happened and transfers vital data. We propose an active detection system using IoT in patient’s surroundings environment detecting falls, which immediately alarms the care providers and transmits vital information for treatment. The system integrates advanced ICT technologies to monitor, detect, and react to the falls. The system uses ANN to improve fall detections.

Previous research concentrated on A-vent design, Near Cloud data caching, and Machine Learning model development. However, it lacks Internet of Things capabilities for remote monitoring applications. This work incorporates new software components to a Near Cloud server that stores and monitors the ventilator and patient data across the wireless network. Wireless sensor nodes attached to the A-vent and patient interaction model capture the time-series waveform of the ventilator, its predictive analysis, and oximeter values. The data queries command displays the data stored in the Near Cloud databases on the monitoring dashboard. It shows a digital representation of the system, allowing real-time updates to be viewed remotely and easily comprehended.

AB  - Hypertension, or elevated blood pressure (BP), is a marker for many cardiovascular diseases and can lead to life threatening conditions such as heart failure, coronary artery disease and stroke. Several techniques have recently been proposed and investigated for non-invasive BP monitoring. The increasing desire for telemonitoring solutions that allow patients to manage their own conditions from home has accelerated the development of new BP monitoring techniques. In this review, we present the recent progress in non-invasive blood pressure monitoring solutions emphasizing clinical validation and trade-offs between available techniques. We introduce the current BP measurement techniques with their underlying operating principles. New promising proof-of-concept studies are presented and recent modeling and machine learning approaches for improved BP estimation are summarized. This aids discussions on how new BP monitors should evaluated in order to bring forth new home monitoring solutions in wearable form factor. Finally, we discuss on unresolved challenges in making convenient, reliable and validated BP monitoring solutions.

AB  - A patient monitoring system is necessary to monitor patient data remotely and precisely, at all times. It is necessary to give a high degree of care to individuals who are at high risk following post-surgical situations. Recent patient monitoring systems are being used for further diagnostic analyses and treatments that are open sourced and might benefit people all around the world. The system's goal is to provide a comprehensive monitoring and analysis platform that provides a one-stop solution for patient monitoring systems. The major goal is to develop a model utilizing Gaussian Expectation Maximization (GEM) enabled Deep Transnet (GEDT) algorithm, for effective detection of patient abnormality. Various physiological parameters are considered for analysis. The data acquired for ECG analysis is compared to the MIT BIH dataset from Physio Net. The standard values for heart rate, temperature, pressure, and oxygen saturation are used. Real-time testing is suggested, with volunteers helping to evaluate the gear. Only a subset of real-time values is used to collect training data. 70% are utilized for training, 15% for testing, and 15% for validation.

AB  - One of the India's largest issues is providing healthcare to rural people; in rural areas, where more than 70% of the population resides and few medical facilities, disease-related mortality rates are at an all-time high. This research aims to suggest a medicine dispatcher box with temperature, heart rate, and pressure sensors as a component of a comprehensive system for rural real-time health management. The suggested system intends to lessen rural populations' challenges accessing healthcare services by offering a holistic solution that blends health monitoring and medication dispensing functions. The system design consists of a wearable patient device, a medicine dispatcher box, which administers medication based on the received health data, and a gateway device that processes and communicates the data to a cloud-based platform. The proposed system will be usable in rural areas with minimal resources because it is made to be user-friendly and economical. The viability and effectiveness of the suggested system are assessed through a series of experiments. The results demonstrate that the suggested approach can potentially enhance healthcare outcomes and accessibility in remote locations.

AB  - Maternal mortality ratio (MMR) of non-developing and developing countries stipulate that every year an enormous number of pregnant women succumbed to death due to lack of proper healthcare service. In the case of Bangladesh, maximum maternal deaths happen in the rural and hill-tracts area due to the communication gap during the emergency moments. To solve this situation, in this study, we have proposed multiple sensor-based systems that focus on the issue of complete health monitoring of an expecting mother. We envisioned to target the expecting mothers who are most of the time-deprived of complete health monitoring during the pregnancy time. Our developed system consists of non-invasive anemia and glucose rate detection, sudden fall detection, heart rate, and body temperature. We have also incorporated Wi-Fi and GSM modules in our device to make it viable for telemonitoring. To monitor all these physical parameters, we have also introduced a custom-made android application. These would allow the expecting mothers to assess their health conditions. The doctors and family members would also get notified through SMS if there is an emergency. The outcome of this research would help the health service providers to envision a different approach to give proper healthcare facilties to expecting mothers, specially in the rural areas.

AB  - Management of shoulder pathologies involves measurement of range of motion (ROM) as well as assessing the quality and efficiency of that motion using different clinical tests. This work describes the preliminary results of using a smart watch to capture the direction of movement, velocity and ROM of the shoulder joint. ROM is the available amount of movement of a joint in different directions which can be either passive, active or active assisted. With the collected dataset and the proposed method, ROM could be estimated with a 9° error. Shoulder function or motion identification was validated by two different methods: i) rule engine and ii) machine learning approach. Rule base engine method was able to successfully identify the motions with accuracy of 91.94% and ML method with 10-Fold Validation reported a best performance of 94.17%. Proposed method, currently tested for some active motions of the shoulder, has the potential to be a very useful assist in quantifying and monitoring rehabilitation of the shoulder joint in multiple clinical situations.

AB  - Telemonitoring is the use of electronic devices such as smartphones to remotely monitor patients. It provides great convenience and enables timely medical decisions. To facilitate the decision making for each patient, a model is needed to translate the data collected by the patient’s smartphone into a predicted score for his/her disease severity. To train a robust predictive model, semi-supervised learning (SSL) provides a viable approach by integrating both labeled and unlabeled samples to leverage all the available data from each patient. There are two challenging issues that need to be simultaneously addressed in using SSL for this problem: (1) feature selection from high-dimensional noisy telemonitoring data; and (2) instance selection from many, possibly redundant unlabeled samples. We propose a novel SSL model allowing for simultaneous feature and instance selection, namely the S2SSL model. We present a real-data application of telemonitoring for patients with Parkinson’s Disease using their smartphone-collected activity data such as tapping and speaking. A total of 382 features were extracted from the activity data of each patient. 74 labeled and 563 unlabeled instances from 37 patients were used to train S2SSL. The trained model achieved a high accuracy of 0.828 correlation between the true and predicted disease severity scores on a validation dataset. Note to Practitioners—Telemonitoring is an emerging health care platform enabled by smartphones and wearables. Because it allows for health data to be collected anytime and anywhere, patients can be frequently monitored and medical decisions can be made more timely and effectively. This paper addresses the data science challenges in leveraging the telemonitoring platform to benefit patient care. Specifically, we propose a new model, S2SSL, to tackle these challenges and provide better robustness, accuracy, and efficiency. This paper may be interesting to health care practitioners seeking advanced analytics capabilities to model and integrate the data collected through telemonitoring devices, with ultimate purposes of improving the decision in treating each patient and increasing patient access to specialized care.

AB  - Plenty of healthcare applications (fitness tracking, sleep pattern monitoring, amount of calories burned, etc.), remote monitoring applications (patient, child or older people), security, and soft biometrics applications require automatic and precise activity recognition. So, this paper demonstrates the best approach among various approaches used for activity classification using the tri-axial gyroscope and accelerometer sensors, which are already integrated into smartphones. Some unique and distinguishable features are extracted using the acquired signals from these sensors. For activity recognition purpose, we have evaluated the performance of the Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Long short term memory (LSTM), and various supervised machine learning algorithms on a human activity recognition data set, UCI HAR dataset (obtained from the inertial sensors of a smartphone). Comparative results obtained on UCI HAR dataset shows that the maximum accuracy achieved so far is 98.57%. Therefore, we have analyzed the effectiveness of various methods using our feature extraction process and observed that 99.9% of accuracy can be achieved with the Ensemble classification method with bagging tree.

AB  - Rapid technological progress has allowed for the creation of novel healthcare solutions that aims to improve patient care and monitoring. Data security and privacy are given high priority in the proposed system, which is a health monitoring platform that leverages the capabilities of the Internet of Things (IOT) and deep learning methods like Transformers in RNN to gather and analyse health data with high precision. For reliable anomaly detection, early risk prediction, and individualized healthcare recommendations, deep learning algorithms are used to sift through the data. The main objective of this research is to design an efficient model for strong authentication to improve the security levels. Given the delicate nature of individual health information, security and privacy are of the utmost importance in health monitoring systems. The SHMS addresses these issues by incorporating strong authentication and encryption technologies to protect information at rest and in transit. An individual's right to decide how their personal health data is used is also carefully protected by these systems. This study describes a major advancement in healthcare technology: a system for secure, accurate, and real-time health monitoring that uses the Internet of Things and a Transformer-based RNN in deep learning. This technology not only improves the ability of healthcare providers to provide timely and effective care, but also protects the privacy and security of patient data. This research presents a Multi-Level Node Authorization and Access Control Model with Dual Key Authentication using Recurrent Neural Networks (MLNA-ACM-DKA-RNN) for secure health monitoring system. The proposed model when compared with the traditional models exhibit better performance.

AB  - Medical healthcare units and diagnostics devices are designed with standard modules installation and almost every sensory device-working mode is similar with differences in mode of data fetching. However, even though the working operations are standard researchers are developing different devices for different diagnostics. Typically, sensors are false in digital or analogue modes only hence developing a generic device supporting multiple types of sensors is feasible and acceptable. For areas with limitations of resources, a multiple functional single device is in high demand. Major issues with such a device development are software and sensor value calibration or calculation as per the requirement. Body statistics include multiple parameters where some are direct values calculated and detected by the sensor itself in real-time, and few parameters are calculated based on the standard procedure of averaging concerning time or the differential value between different processes or values. The proposed system is designed to overcome this problem and implement a single device with multiple functional algorithms execution as and when required and demand based. The research study presented the method to handle different processes on demand and stated the multiple procedures of operations in healthcare devices.

AB  - Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent, unprovoked seizures that affects millions of people globally. The unpredictable nature of seizures in epilepsy necessitates vigilant monitoring of these patients to mitigate the risk of adverse events, including physical injury, that may occur during convulsive seizures. It is essential in handling cases of epilepsy that episodes be detected and patient data be stored for later examination. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a potentially revolutionary development in the medical industry since it makes it possible to collect data from individuals using biosensors. This information is then sent to a remote server or cloud storage where it can be analyzed by machine learning software. This article reviews epilepsy patient monitoring IoT platforms and systems that use machine learning and deep learning. It also discusses new research that has greatly used these technologies in monitoring and seizure detection. The most effective sensor devices for detecting and monitoring seizures are also highlighted, and information on the most prevalent kinds of epilepsy types is provided.

AB  - The clinical assessment technology such as remote monitoring of rehabilitation progress for lower limb related ailments rely on the automatic evaluation of movement performed along with an estimation of joint angle information. In this paper, we introduce a transfer-learning based Long-term Recurrent Convolution Network (LRCN) named as `MyoNet' for the classification of lower limb movements, along with the prediction of the corresponding knee joint angle. The model consists of three blocks- (i) feature extractor block, (ii) joint angle prediction block, and (iii) movement classification block. Initially, the model is end-to-end trained for knee joint angle prediction followed by transferring the knowledge of a trained model to the movement classification through transfer-learning approach making a memory and computationally efficient design. The proposed MyoNet was evaluated on publicly available University of California (UC) Irvine machine learning repository dataset of the lower limb for 11 healthy subjects and 11 subjects with knee pathology for three movements type-walking, standing with knee flexion movements and sitting with knee extension movements. The average mean absolute error (MAE) resulted in the prediction of joint angle for healthy subjects and subjects with knee pathology are 8.1 % and 9.2 % respectively. Subsequently, an average classification accuracy of 98.1 % and 92.4 % were achieved for healthy subjects and subjects with knee pathology, respectively. Interestingly, the significance of this study in itself is promising with substantial improvement in the performance compared to state-of-the-art methodologies. The clinical significance of such surface electromyography signals (sEMG) based movement recognition and prediction of corresponding joint angle system could be beneficial for remote monitoring of rehabilitation progress by the physiotherapist using wearables.

AB  - Agriculture, healthcare, and manufacturing all use the Internet of Things. In recent years, smartwatches in healthcare monitoring have proliferated. This inspired the IoMT (IoT) network. Early disease identification by the IoMT reduces mortality. Clinical statistics must address cardiovascular disease prediction. The planned study would employ machine learning to identify heart disease risk factors. Several heart disease studies have shown limited accuracy. This research develops a cardiovascular disease diagnosis model using AI and IoT convergence. The model includes data collection, preliminary processing, classification, and parameter tuning. Wearables and other Internet of Things devices, including sensors, seamlessly gather data, which artificial intelligence uses to identify ailments. The recommended technique uses a Cuttlefish-based Cascaded Long Short-Term Memory (MCFA-CLSTM) model for illness diagnosis. MCFA adjusts CLSTM model “weights” and “bias” parameters. This improves medical data classification. MCFA improves CLSTM model diagnostics. Healthcare data verified the MCFA-CLSTM model. The MCFA-LSTM model diagnosed cardiac illness with 97.26% accuracy. Thus, advanced healthcare systems may use the MCFA-LSTM model to identify sickness.

AB  - Ballistocardiography (BCG) is a vibration signal of human cardiac activity, which can be obtained by an optical fiber sensor (OFS) in a noninvasive way. The proposed OFS, as a low power consumption, noncontact, noninvasive real-time health monitoring instrument, has been developed into an effective health care monitoring method. However, when people need to monitor BCG for a long time, a large number of BCG data needs to be collected, which is time-consuming, costly, and labor-intensive. To solve this problem, in this article, we proposed a novel deep learning model, termed BCGNET. First, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to extract the short-term dependence between multivariate loads. Then, the recurrent neural network (RNN) model is used to capture the long-term dependence of load sequence, and the ultra-long-term repetitive pattern of load sequence is fully studied by using the long-short term memory (LSTM) network with a recurrent skip. Finally, the autoregressive layer and full connection layer are used for combined prediction. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of BCGNET; the accuracy is 91.43% achieved by the proposed BCGNET compared with CNN (89.61%), RNN (89.88%) and multihead attention network (MHA-Net) (90.22%), and also show the proposed model has good performance in BCG prediction and assessment.

AB  - Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are recognized for their intelligence as they seamlessly interact with humans, enhancing the physical world through computation, communication, and control. Over the last few years, the evolution of CPS, including IoT components, has significantly impacted many facets of people’s lifestyles. It has been immersed in a wide range of services and applications in various areas, including manufacturing, healthcare, and energy. However, the interrelationship between the cyber and physical worlds gives rise to a multitude of research problems and challenges. In the healthcare field, for instance, CPS introduces complexities related to interoperability, privacy, data security, and real-time data processing with critical implications for the reliability and safety of medical processes. To address these challenges and harness the full potential of CPS in healthcare, this paper, through a comprehensive literature review, aims to discuss cutting-edge CPS technologies and solutions that hold promise for healthcare applications. To this end, we propose a comprehensive architectural model that can serve as a benchmark for implementing CPS in healthcare applications. This model thoroughly details how services, components, and technologies can be integrated to transform massive raw data collected from the physical world into valuable information for an enhanced decision-making process. Finally, a use case on healthcare CPS is presented, outlining its characteristics, the role that different technologies have played in its development, and the major challenges in implementing such systems successfully. This study provides a cohesive understanding of the role CPS can play in empowering healthcare while offering insights into the challenges, and future research trends.

AB  - A smart patient monitoring system based on the Internet of Things (IoT) was proposed in this paper that supports the health care unit, especially in light of the Covid-19 crisis. Health institutions suffer from many problems, such as the spread of infections among the health staff due to their direct communication with the patient, and the tremendous pressure on health institutions. These circumstances prompted to suggest a system that is capable of solving these problems and providing access to vital information such as body temperature, heartbeat and blood oxygen, as well as monitoring the recovery room such as temperature, humidity and gases by using wireless medical sensors. This data is transmitted to the computing cloud using wi-fi network, after which it is displayed on the Thing speak platform where doctors and nurses can monitor their patients remotely anywhere and anytime. The proposed system will use the machine learning algorithm and the hardware component (DHT11, MQ2, MAX30100 and MLX90614) sensors and the ESP NODE MCU microcontroller, which is programmed via the IDE software based on C language. The system achieved good results and a high accuracy with low energy consumption, according to the experiments' results.

AB  - Objective: With the increasing use of wearable healthcare devices for remote patient monitoring, reliable signal quality assessment (SQA) is required to ensure the high accuracy of interpretation and diagnosis on the recorded data from patients. Photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals non-invasively measured by wearable devices are extensively used to provide information about the cardiovascular system and its associated diseases. In this study, we propose an approach to optimize the quality assessment of the PPG signals. Methods: We used an ensemble-based feature selection scheme to enhance the prediction performance of the classification model to assess the quality of the PPG signals. Our approach for feature and subset size selection yielded the best-suited feature subset, which was optimized to differentiate between the clean and artifact corrupted PPG segments. Conclusion: A high discriminatory power was achieved between two classes on the test data by the proposed feature selection approach, which led to strong performance on all dependent and independent test datasets. We achieved accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity rates of higher than 0.93, 0.89, and 0.97, respectively, for dependent test datasets, independent of heartbeat type, i.e., atrial fibrillation (AF) or non-AF data including normal sinus rhythm (NSR), premature atrial contraction (PAC), and premature ventricular contraction (PVC). For independent test datasets, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity rates were greater than 0.93, 0.89, and 0.97, respectively, on PPG data recorded from AF and non-AF subjects. These results were found to be more accurate than those of all of the contemporary methods cited in this work. Significance: As the results illustrate, the advantage of our proposed scheme is its robustness against dynamic variations in the PPG signal during long-term 14-day recordings accompanied with different types of physical activities and a diverse range of fluctuations and waveforms caused by different individual hemodynamic characteristics, and various types of recording devices. This robustness instills confidence in the application of the algorithm to various kinds of wearable devices as a reliable PPG signal quality assessment approach.

AB  - In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, patients were required to manually input their daily oxygen saturation (SpO2) and pulse rate (PR) values into a health monitoring system—unfortunately, such a process trend to be an error in typing. Several studies attempted to detect the physiological value from the captured image using optical character recognition (OCR). However, the technology has limited availability with high cost. Thus, this study aimed to propose a novel framework called pandemic accelerated human-machine collaboration (PACMAN) with a low-resource deep learning-based computer vision. We compared state-of-the-art object detection algorithms (scaled YOLOv4, YOLOv5, and YOLOR), including the commercial OCR tools for digit recognition on the captured images from the pulse oximeter display. All images were derived from crowdsourced data collection with varying quality and alignment. YOLOv5 was the best performing model against the given model comparison across all data sets, notably the correctly orientated image data set. We further improved the model performance with the digits auto-orientation algorithm and applied a clustering algorithm to extract SpO2 and PR values. The accuracy performance of YOLOv5 with the implementations was approximately 81.0–89.5%, which was enhanced compared to without any additional implementation. Accordingly, this study highlighted the completion of the PACMAN framework to detect and read digits in real-world data sets. The proposed framework has been currently integrated into the patient monitoring system utilized by hospitals nationwide.

AB  - The advancement in automation and medical care technologies in recent decade has changed the traditional medical treatment of patients. Although, these technologies have increased the treatment’s precision but the growing number and the complexity of IoT healthcare devices are impacting accuracy along with several other challenges. Moreover, the use of different programming languages, operating platforms and data management methodologies are creating restrictions in safe exchange, integration and reuse of information across different applications. However, with the advent of the semantic web, the semantic technologies are growing in healthcare systems due to the capability of machine interpretation and processing by overcoming the restriction of languages and data heterogeneity. The most common shortcoming in the existing systems are the context-awareness and quality of services and the absence of rich patient ontology; leading towards low accuracy of results. To this aim, this paper provides a smart health framework, consisting on the collection and processing of IoT data (related to patient conditions and context). The framework is supported by the patient ontology along with SWRL rules for better decision making that consider different features (context-awareness and quality of services) differently that results in the improved accuracy. In the evaluation process the proposed work has achieved an accuracy of 89.81%. This work will help the practitioners to treat the patients in a better way.

AB  - Heart related diseases causes elevation to the fatality rate across the world especially post-Covid. Furthermore, high security cryptographic algorithms are used to provide confidentiality and availability to sensitive data collected from imbedded medical devices. To escalate the rapid and prior diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases especially if a person has a history of heart related ailment, an effective solution is to bring Machine Learning Models and Data Analysis for operative decision making and precise cum accurate prediction. In the proposed work, encountering numerous challenges around the machine learning models along with a sound and lightweight encryption technique to provide added security to the sensitive medical data of the patient for careful analysis by both the model and prescriptive doctor-patient interface using an IoT based cloud environment running in the background has been used. The sensor data will be used in two fronts - on one end the data will be uploaded to the ThingSpeak IoT platform where it will provide the analytics of the patient health status (both past and present) and a likelihood of chance of experiencing any heart-health abnormality to the patient there and then along with on the other end it is stored on the Fire-Base Cloud Storage space which is stored with encryption protocols to enhance the security of the patient’s sensitive health data which can be reviewed by an expert doctor. Experimental outcomes show us that K-nearest neighbor algorithm achieves the best results among logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest tree and voting classifier with accuracy of 88.5% and 88%, 86%, 85.2% and 86.88%. Therefore, the suggested model is successful is achieving an effective accuracy by secure IoT data in cloud based IoT platforms.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) technology has been widely introduced to the existing medical system. An eHealth system based on IoT devices has gained widespread popularity. In this article, we propose an IoT eHealth framework to provide an autonomous solution for patients with interventional cardiovascular diseases. In this framework, wearable sensors are used to collect a patient's health data, which is daily monitored by a remote doctor. When the monitoring data is abnormal, the remote doctor will ask for image acquisition of the patient's cardiovascular internal conditions. We leverage edge computing to classify these training images by the local base classifier; thereafter, pseudo-labels are generated according to its output. Moreover, a deep segmentation network is leveraged for the segmentation of stent structs in intravascular optical coherence tomography and intravenous ultrasound images of patients. The experimental results demonstrate that remote and local doctors perform real-time visual communication to complete telesurgery. In the experiments, we adopt the U-net backbone with a pretrained SeResNet34 as the encoder to segment the stent structs. Meanwhile, a series of comparative experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method based on accuracy, sensitivity, Jaccard, and dice.

AB  - Electrocardiogram (ECG) is an electrical activity of the heart, which can be recorded by placing electrodes near heart or on the limbs. ECG is a vital body signal, which reflects the heart health condition. This paper presents a new wearable ECG system, which can be used for long-term rhythm monitoring with the potential of increased sensitivity to detect intermittent or subclinical arrhythmia. This study presents the design and development of a wearable pervasive healthcare monitoring system by ECG measurement systems and internet of things (IoT) platform. In this design, non-intrusive healthcare system was designed based on wireless body area network (WBAN) for wide area coverage with minimum battery power to support wireless transmission. Data were transmitted via Wi-Fi to the personalized mobile system. These were integrated into a comfortable, easy to wear, and ergonomically designed armband ECG sensor system, which can acquire an ECG signal from the upper arm of the user over a period of 72 hours.

AB  - The rise of Telemedicine has revolutionized how patients are being treated, leading to several advantages such as enhanced health analysis tools, accessible remote healthcare, basic diagnostic of health parameters, etc. The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI) and their incorporation into Telemedicine extends the potential of health benefits of Telemedicine even further. Therefore, the synergy between AI, IoT, and Telemedicine creates diverse innovative scenarios for integrating cyber-physical systems into medical health to provide remote monitoring and interactive assistance to patients. Data from World Health Organization reports that 7.4 million people died because of Atrial Fibrillation (AF), recognizing the most common arrhythmia associated with human heart rate. Causes like unhealthy diet, smoking, poor resources to go to the doctor and based on research studies, about 12 and 17.9 million of people will be suffering the AF in the USA and Europe, in 2050 and 2060, respectively. The AF as a cardiovascular disease is becoming an important public health issue to tackle. By using a systematic approach, this paper reviews recent contributions related to the acquisition of heart beats, arrhythmia detection, IoT, and visualization. In particular, by analysing the most closely related papers on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and IoT devices in heart disease diagnostics, we present a summary of the main research gaps with suggested directions for future research.

AB  - Fall detection is a critical task in healthcare and elderly monitoring systems, and Wi-Fi signals have emerged as a promising solution. In this paper, we propose a new approach for intelligent real-time fall detection using fine-grained Channel State Information (CSI) of Wi-Fi signals. The proposed model, FallCNN, is a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on a dataset of Wi-Fi CSI data collected for seven daily human activities performed in an indoor environment. FallCNN benefits from raw Wi-Fi CSI data and outputs a binary classification for fall detection. To improve performance and generalization ability, the proposed approach employs time series data augmentation. We evaluate the proposed model on a dataset that includes falls. The proposed work addresses the limitations of existing methods and demonstrates the potential of Wi-Fi-based fall detection in real-world applications. Experimental results and performance evaluation confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB  - Domain adaptation for sensor-based activity learning is of utmost importance in remote health monitoring research. However, many domain adaptation algorithms suffer with failure to operate adaptation in presence of target domain heterogeneity (which is always present in reality) and presence of multiple inhabitants dramatically hinders their generalizability producing unsatisfactory results for semi-supervised and unseen activity learning tasks. We propose AEDA, a novel deep auto-encoder- based model to enable semi-supervised domain adaptation in the existence of target domain heterogeneity and how to incorporate it to empower heterogeneity to any homogeneous deep domain adaptation architecture for cross-domain activity learning. Ex-perimental evaluation on 18 different heterogeneous and multi- inhabitants use-cases of 8 different domains created from 2 publicly available human activity datasets (wearable and ambient smart homes) shows that AEDA outperforms (max. 12.8% and 8.9 % improvements for ambient smart home and wearables) over existing domain adaptation techniques for both seen and unseen activity learning in a heterogeneous setting.

AB  - The Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has created a huge havoc on a global scale including Pakistan and its surrounding regions in South Asia. The underdeveloped medical infrastructure and inadequate healthcare staff have become a dilemma during this pandemic fostering the need for digital health system. In this paper we propose Diagnose A Disease (DAD), a novel telehealth solution in Pakistan for remote patient monitoring and disease diagnosis. The three layered hybrid architecture of DAD comprises of data collection layer, analytics engine layer and cloud storage layer. In the first module, vital physiological signs of patients are measured and recorded through a set of wearable sensors. The next module makes use of fog enabled cloud framework for resource management of worker nodes. The analytics engine module also includes a trained Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory neural network model for heart disease, blood pressure and diabetes classification. Finally, the last module makes use of the cloud service for data storage, analysis and distributed secured health data sharing among medical authorities. The telehealth solution comes with emergency notifications, standard clinical guidelines and many advanced features with fog service to reduce latency and delays that becomes crucial in healthcare applications. PureEdgeSim, a simulation toolkit for fog environments is used to evaluate the proposed DAD model in terms of latency, bandwidth usage, power consumption, execution period and accuracy. Results depict that the proposed architecture performed well in handling real time requests, resource utilization and response time for healthcare decision making which further enhances its utility in real life situations.

AB  - With the development of the social economy, the demand for rehabilitation medical devices is also increasing. However, most rehabilitation devices on the market currently have problems such as bulky equipment, inconvenient operation, and high cost. Taking hand grasp force as the main monitoring parameter, this paper designs a low-cost hand rehabilitation system that is convenient to use, can remotely monitor the progress of hand rehabilitation. The system can well solve the large volume of equipment caused by the complex structure of the existing hand rehabilitation equipment. It can also solve the problems that the device cannot obtain the data of the patient’s recovery in real-time and the use cost is too high. The system includes five modules: flexible pressure sensor module, voltage conversion module, microcomputer module, LCD module and NB-IoT communication module. The flexible pressure sensor module can be attached to the patient’s hand to monitor the recovery data in real-time and see the recovery progress visually on the LCD screen. In addition, rehabilitation data can be uploaded remotely through the NB-IoT communication module for remote guidance by professional doctors to speed up the process of hand rehabilitation.

With the increasing interest in digital health research, there has been a surge in the volume of Internet of Things (IoT) data derived from smartphones, wearables, and ambient sensors. Managing this vast amount of data, encompassing diverse data types and varying time scales, is crucial. Moreover, compliance with regulatory and contractual obligations is essential. The proposed data fabric comprises an architecture and a toolkit that facilitate the integration of heterogeneous data sources, across different environments, to provide a unified view of the data in dashboards. Furthermore, the data fabric supports the development of reusable and configurable data integration components, which can be shared as open-source or inner-source software. These components are used to generate data pipelines that can be deployed and scheduled to run either in the cloud or on-premises. Additionally, we present the implementation of our data fabric in a home-based telemonitoring research project involving older adults, conducted in collaboration with the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). The study showcases the streamlined integration of data collected from various IoT sensors and mobile applications to create a unified view of older adults’ health for further analysis and research.

AB  - The Intelligent Hybrid Model for energy efficiency on Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) has gained substantial attention for its potential to enable remote monitoring and healthcare applications. However, energy efficiency remains a crucial challenge in the design and operation of WBANs due to the constrained resources of wearable devices and the need for continuous operation. In this research paper, we recommend an intelligent hybrid framework for energy efficiency in WBANs. The model combines the benefits of two key techniques: dynamic duty cycling and machine learning-based optimization. By intelligently adapting the duty cycle of individual sensor nodes based on their activity levels and environmental context, the proposed framework may optimize energy consumption while maintaining reliable data transmission. Additionally, machine learning algorithms are used, that can also help in the prediction of sensor node activity patterns and optimize duty cycle settings in real-time. The intelligent hybrid framework may achieve significant energy savings that extend the WBAN devices' lifetime and also enhance their reliability for critical healthcare applications. The proposed model holds the potential to revolutionize the energy efficiency paradigm in WBANs, paving the way for widespread adoption and deployment in various healthcare and remote monitoring scenarios.

AB  - There is a greater demand to enhance intelligent healthcare systems in order to keep track of the medical condition of patients. This demand leads to increase the interest in remote healthcare systems that make use of biosensors. These biosensors generate a significant amount of vital sensed data, which is then sent to the edge of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) for processing before being sent on to the data centers of the cloud. In this paper, we propose an EEG data reduction and epileptic seizures detection in IoMT networks. The suggested method operates on 2 levels within the network: edge and fog levels. At the edge gateway, The EEG data is transformed into time-frequency representations using Short Time Fourier Transformation (STFT). Then, a set of statistical texture feature based on the gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) is extracted. These EEG based features are then compressed before being sent to the fog gateway using a binary-encoded representative method. In Fog Gateway, the received encoded features are decoded and passed into a classifier to determine the patient's situation. A set of classifiers are used to evaluate the proposed method using the Bonn University dataset. The proposed technique demonstrates the outperformance of the proposed method by achieving an accuracy of (100%) in multiple cases and an acceptable accuracy for other cases while considering fewer features compared to existing work.

AB  - Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using smartphone sensors is among the most demanding Artificial Intelligence (AI) topics for its growing applications in clinical healthcare monitoring. Although implementing an accurate HAR model is essential, developing a personalized one and adapting it to the end-user is challenging in real-life applications. There are various personalization methods in HAR. This research combines two personalization methods to adapt the proposed HAR model to individual subjects. Accordingly, we developed an Android application to capture the accelerometers of fifteen subjects during six predefined daily activities, such as standing, sitting, lying down, walking, going upstairs, and going downstairs. Subjects were instructed to carry the phone in predetermined positions in fixed or free modes. These positions include locations where people mostly carry their smartphones. The proposed personalized HAR model consisted of two main steps: (1) the dataset was divided into multiple groups based on the subjects' physical similarities, e.g., such as weight and height. Then, (2) based on multiple data splitting configurations (user-independent, user-dependent, and hybrid), the HAR model is generalized to the end-user in each group using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). After normalization and windowing, the collected data were fed to the LSTM network. The model was trained and validated by 80% and 20% of the dataset, respectively. Finally, we evaluated our proposed model using the Human Activity Sensing Consortium (HASC) corpus 2011, a large, publicly available dataset. The proposed LSTM network with the user-dependent personalization method produced an average F-measure of 0.99 and 1 for our dataset and the HASC dataset, respectively.

In e-health, systems are equipped with wearable devices that aid in remote monitoring with the help of Internet of Things (IoT). Our proposed work ensures fall detection using a three-layer architecture (Edge-Fog-Cloud) which takes advantage of the available smart devices. The edge detection involves vision-based detection using a compressed neural network running on a smart device constructed using transfer learning. Decision making in fog involves ensemble learning methodology using sensor-based data and decision from the edge. The cloud is used for permanent storage and model building. The work also takes advantage of image augmentation for data set building to improve the performance of the model. The model is evaluated based on accuracy, and the advantage of the fog layer is evaluated based on the latency. The proposed model gives an accuracy of 98.5% which is compared with the existing state-of-the-art algorithms available for detection.

AB  - Medical Internet of Things (MIoT) is a rapidly growing field that promises to revolutionize health care. The ability to connect devices and collect data from them has the potential to transform the way it monitors and treat patients. However, the security and privacy of this data is a major concern. The cryptography and other conventional methods for security in resource constrained MIoT has several shortcomings. First, it does not provide adequate protection for patient data. Second, it is not designed to work with the large number of devices and huge volumes of data that are typically generated in MIoT applications. In this article, secure M-Trust privacy protocol (SMP) has been designed to address these issues. The SMP protocol uses a combination of trust, cryptographic, and machine learning techniques to provide security and privacy for data in transit. The SMP protocol has been designed to work with the smart health care monitoring system to provide a secure and private communication channel between devices in the system. The SMP protocol is an improvement over the existing security and privacy protocols for medical data. The simulation results proves that the SMP protocol is more efficient and scalable than the existing protocols. The SMP protocol is a valuable addition to the MIoT landscape and can help improve the privacy of data exchanged between medical devices.

AB  - With the dramatic increase of the Internet of Medical Things devices, self and remote health data monitoring is consistently receiving more attention. However, medical devices are usually challenging to deploy due to privacy regulations, and they generally leverage a centralized third party. Enabling data sharing would enhance new medical studies, formulate new treatments, and deliver new digital health technologies. Solving the issue will have a triple impact: we will handle sensitive information easily, contribute to international medical advancements, and enable personalized care. A possible solution is to exploit decentralization distributing privacy concerns directly to users. Solutions enabling this vision are closely linked to Distributed Ledger Technologies. Through its characteristics of immutability and transparency, this technology would allow privacy-compliant solutions in contexts where privacy is the first need. This paper envisions the InterPlanetary Health Layer and related real-world implementations in the Internet of Medical Things domain. The main idea of the proposed solution is to handle sensitive data by preserving privacy and guaranteeing data availability. Specifically, users can build their private network, collaboratively authorize operations among their data and manage their privacy conditions without relying on a third party. The results of several stress tests conducted on a real case study confirmed the feasibility of the proposed solution, which shows good scalability and a modest impact on the application performance measured during the decentralized data access.

AB  - Atrial fibrillation is one of the most common arrhythmia events potentially causing heart failures and thrombosis. Recently, many healthcare applications have been developed with the aim to provide a reliable real-time detection of such abnormal heartbeat behavior. The largest part of current solutions considers signal processing applied to electrocardiographic (ECG) segments recorded with wearable devices/sensors and specifically tailored to the number of available ECG leads. Differently, in this contribution, we present a lightweight machine learning algorithm for the analysis of ECG signals and atrial fibrillation detection, easily adaptable for both single and multi-lead architectures. Furthermore, we describe how the proposed scheme can be implemented with an edge computing approach that paves the way toward smart healthcare at home and remotely in general. In such framework, signal processing is not necessarily performed on a unique device, but it is conveniently split so as to let fast operations at the network edge, with storage and heavy computing being instead handled at cloud server side.

AB  - Objective: Autonomic Dysreflexia (AD) is a potentially life-threatening syndrome which occurs in individuals with higher level spinal cord injuries (SCI). AD is caused by triggers which can lead to rapid escalation of pathophysiological responses and if the trigger is not removed, AD can be fatal. There is currently no objective, non-invasive and accurate monitoring system available to automatically detect the onset of AD symptoms in real time in a non-clinical setting. Technology or Method: We developed a user-independent method of symptomatic AD detection in real time with a wearable physiological telemetry system (PTS) and a machine learning model using data from eleven participants with SCI. Results: The PTS could detect onset of AD symptoms with an average accuracy of 94.10% and a false negative rate of 4.89%. Conclusions: The PTS can detect the onset of the symptoms AD with high sensitivity and specificity to assist people with SCIs in preventing the occurrence of AD. It would enable persons with high level SCIs to be more independent and pursue vocational activities while granting continuous medical oversight. Clinical Impact: The PTS could serve as a supplementary tool to current solutions to detect the onset of AD and prepare individuals who are newly injured to be better prepared for AD episodes. Moreover, it could be translated into a system to encourage individuals to practice better healthcare management to prevent future occurrences.

AB  - In this work, an attempt has been made to monitor preterm labor in pregnant women using IoT based wearable tocometer system. Preterm labor is the leading cause of death in prematurely born babies due to lack of neonatal healthcare services in rural areas. Uterine muscle contraction often varies over the gestational period and it increases exponentially during the time of labor. For pregnant women, monitoring the activity of the uterus is a challenging task since there are often indications of false labor pain. The proposed system consists of an accelerometer and vibration sensor detect the uterine contractions. The signals are sent to Arduino wherein the normal and abnormal threshold are predefined. In case of abnormal contractions, the Arduino sends alert notification to the emergency contacts via Short Message Service (SMS) using Global System for Mobile communication (GSM) along with the location information of the individual using Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking. The device also sends emergency alert to the nearby hospital so that both maternal and neonatal care services are provided at the earliest. The uterine activity is also displayed as values in Liquid Crystal Display (LCD). The initial Printed Circuit Boards (PCB) design was carried out in Easily Applicable Graphical Layout Editor (EAGLE) software and then implemented in hardware. Compared to the conventional Cardiotocography (CTG) machines, this wearable system could provide continuous remote monitoring in case of high risk pregnancies in a cost efficient manner eliminating the frequent hospital visits during false labor alerts. Hence, this system could assist the clinicians in monitoring preterm labor in pregnant women.

AB  - Diabetes is a global health threat, and its prevalence is rising at an alarming rate. Diabetes is the cause of severe complications in vital organs of the body. So, diabetes must be detected early for timely treatment and to prevent the condition from escalating to severe consequences. Many AI and machine learning approaches have been proposed for the non-invasive continuous monitoring of diabetes. However, using such informal methods in healthcare monitoring raises concerns about reliability. Furthermore, deploying an AI-based solution to continuously monitor a person's health state on resource-constrained embedded devices is a concern. We overcome these shortcomings in this work by proposing a formal runtime monitoring system for the first time for diabetes detection using Electrocardiogram (ECG) sensing. We implement a data mining model from the ECG features to infer ECG policies and thereby synthesize a formal verification monitor based on the policies. Using a diabetes dataset, we evaluate the verification monitor's performance compared to other proposed models.
