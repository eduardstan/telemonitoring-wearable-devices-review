AB  - Real-time monitoring is an essential part in the development of healthcare monitoring systems. Research has shown that human movement affects the propagation of radio frequencies, as signals will reflect off the human body. Machine Learning techniques have been used in research to classify patterns observed in the signal propagation. This paper makes use of universal software radio peripheral devices to create a wireless communication link where the signal propagation data, known as channel state information, is collected while a user moves or remains still. A machine learning model which achieved an accuracy result of 93.25 % is used to classify between movement and no activity. Inference is then used to decide if the human position is sitting or standing and detected movements are used to differentiate between the two positions. The testbed implements cloud storage and a web-interface to present a visualisation of the human position.

AB  - Recent days, Patient Monitoring helps the medical professionals to monitor patient throughout the day. Also, the use of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) enables this process to be done remotely. IoMT is a subset of Internet of Things, specialized in medical applications. Moreover, Artificial Intelligence (AI) based image classification algorithms can be incorporated to improvise and automate the process, to detect the patients' health state. In this work, an edge computing enabled Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) device is designed and developed for remote health monitoring applications. Further, a less expensive ESP32 CAM device is utilized as an edge computing enabled IoMT device in which a MobileNetV2 version 0.35 model Algorithm is integrated to predict two different patient activities such as asleep and critical conditions. Results demonstrate that the MobileNetV2 version 0.35 model has a better classification accuracy of 97.5%. Also, it is observed that the proposed AI-enabled edge computing device is capable of identifying the patient's conditions and it alerts the physician about the patient's critical conditions using Short Messaging Service (SMS). This work appears to be of high societal relevance since the proposed device helps the physician to monitor the patient's conditions in a remote manner.

AB  - Smart healthcare is crucial for those who require ongoing monitoring that cannot be offered outside of hospitals. Additionally, it is crucial in rural areas where adjacent private clinics may converse with urban hospitals on the health of their patients. This study intends a smart, sensor-based health observer system that notifies the concerned party through SMS while monitoring the patient's state using biomedical sensors. Here, the biomedical sensors are interfaced with a Wi-Fi module controller, which reads the data, and outputs it to an LCD or serial monitor. For a smartphone to show data, SMS must be used. a message sent by the patient's family members to make accessing the patient's information simple. Monitoring the patient at home and regularly checking on their health is a particularly difficult chore in routinely busy work. It is important to periodically check older people's health to prevent serious medical emergencies.

AB  - In the field of data-driven healthcare systems, wireless-based human activity monitoring in an indoor environment is getting popular. Localization of human activities can help patients to get remote healthcare. Wearable devices are employed in modern healthcare monitoring systems, despite the fact that they can be inconvenient and expensive. Several studies have shown that analyzing variations in Channel State Information (CSI) can be used to identify activities in an indoor environment and monitor health utilizing radio frequencies. The results of an experiment using Software Defined Radio (SDR) to identify and localize human activities while a human subject performed six different classes of activities (no-activity, leaning forward, sitting, standing, walking-Rx, walking-Tx). The CSI extracted from the communication channel between two Universal Software Radio Peripherals (USRP) devices communicating and operating as SDRs was used to collect a total of 2100 sample data. The Extra Tree (ET) classifier outperformed the prior benchmark approaches in localizing six activities across the 21 classes. The proposed ET classifier can identify if the room is occupied and a human subject’s walking directions in two separate zones, as well as localize six distinct activities inside the room with an accuracy of 91% and 100% respectively.

AB  - Globally, cardiovascular disorders, including Atrial Fibrillation (AF), are a major health issue. Telemedicine and cloud-based neural networks are used to improve heart disease diagnosis and monitoring for AF patients in this research. Our technique uses remote patient monitoring and AI to improve AF diagnosis, treatment, and management. This paper develops a cloud-integrated neural network model to interpret real-time patient electrocardiogram (ECG) data. The neural network is trained on a broad dataset to detect modest AF start or progression patterns. Scalable, accessible, and effective data management is achieved using cloud computing. Telemedicine is crucial to this framework since it allows patients to be monitored remotely. Healthcare practitioners get notifications for abnormal ECG patterns, allowing quick intervention and individualized treatment. Patient data is safely saved in the cloud for long-term analysis and population-level AF research. The suggested telemedicine method improves AF event detection accuracy, according to preliminary data. Cloud-based neural networks improve diagnostics and enable healthcare research and information exchange. The system advances cardiac disease management, emphasizing AF, using integration and technology. This research may improve patient outcomes, lower healthcare costs, and increase population-level cardiovascular health knowledge. Teleconsultations maintain patient care while protecting sensitive health data. The system’s flexibility and learning increase diagnostic accuracy.

AB  - This pilot study used Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models to predict exercise exertion levels based on physiological data acquired from wearable devices. The data, including revolutions per minute (RPM), level of oxygen saturation, real-time ECG, and pulse rate were collected during a 16-minute cycling exercise across three intensity levels. Ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) from study subjects were recorded at the end of each consecutive minute during every session. The 16-minute sessions were segmented into eight 2-minute windows, and each window was categorized as either "high exertion" or "low exertion" based on self-reported RPEs. Predictive features were calculated by averaging oxygen saturation levels, heart rate, and RPMs for each 2-minute window. Additionally, heart rate variability (HRV) features were extracted from collected ECG data in both temporal and frequency domains. The selection of predictive features was performed using the minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) algorithm. The top features selected were employed to train and test the LSTM and the GRU classifiers for predicting the exertion level of the subsequent window. The resulting classifiers exhibited testing accuracies of 78.6% and F-1 scores of 80%. This pilot study underscores the potential of employing a deep learning model for real-time prediction of perceived exercise exertion.

AB  - In medical practices, the detection of diseases highly depends on different medical tests. Electrocardiogram (ECG) technique is commonly used for heart disease diagnosis. Doctors can measure pulse and other heart boundaries with the aid of it. Fast and precise detection of forms of arrhythmia is critical while identifying heart disease. In this work, we proposed an intelligent ECG device (called iKardo) with the built-in automatic capability to classify into critical and non-critical data from an imbalanced ECG dataset for the smart IoT or Internet of Things based smart healthcare device. Particular emphasis is given to the reduction of data misclassification by converting imbalanced data into a balanced dataset using necessary techniques. This proposed iKardo helps in the accurate detection of critical ECG beats with an accuracy of 99.58% and result in a smart healthcare monitoring device that would make the disease detection fast and precise.

AB  - In the fields of cardiology and biomedical engineering, categorization of arrhythmias is a subject of extensive investigation. The precise categorization of arrhythmias is crucial for diagnosis, therapy planning, and patient care. Arrhythmias are irregular cardiac rhythms that can have catastrophic effects on a patient's health. Research on the categorization of arrhythmias frequently focuses on creating algorithms and models for precisely recognising and categorising various arrhythmia types using electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. This can aid in the identification of arrhythmias and assist physicians in deciding on the best course of therapy for patients. Research on the classification of arrhythmias frequently entails the creation and assessment of several feature extraction and selection strategies in order to pinpoint pertinent aspects from ECG signals that are most instructive for precise categorization. In order to create useful arrhythmia classification models, feature engineering is a crucial step. Research in this field aids in the discovery of novel features or feature combinations that might boost classification accuracy. The objective of this venture is to make an ECG classification based on exchange learning that can perceive arrhythmia. Our DenseNet121 model was shown to have good classification abilities for identifying arrhythmia, with an accuracy rate of more than 80%.

AB  - Human life has become smarter by utilizing big data, telecommunication technologies, and wearable sensors over pervasive computing to give better healthcare services. Big data is built with the possibility to improve the healthcare industry. Big data makes the interconnection between patients, wearable sensors, healthcare caregivers, and providers through the utilization of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and software. Most of the economic challenges in developing countries are caused by the healthcare sector, which occurs predominantly due to the increasing population requiring more quality of care concerning older people. Older people need great attention and care as they lead with irreparable damages when a minor accident or insignificant disease occurs. Therefore, the necessity of implementing new technologies and tools has arisen to support senior citizens regarding their healthcare. Various advancements in wireless technology, miniaturization, computing power, and processing made diverse healthcare innovations that led to developing the connected medical devices. Hence, this proposal develops a new healthcare monitoring system for tracking the activities of elderly people, where the Hadoop MapReduce technique for parallel processing the large-sized data. The data collected as mentioned in the available datasets is performed by using the numerous wearable sensors fixed on the “subject’s left ankle, right arm, and chest” that are transformed to the cloud platform and also to the data analytics layer according to the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices. The given input undergoes data splitting to produce tiny chunks. These small chunks of the input files are then considered as Map tasks. Here, in the map phase, the features are optimally selected by the Hybrid Dingo Coyote Optimization (HDCO). The combiner phase classifies the physical activities using the developed Deep Ensemble Learning (DEL) consisting of classifiers such as “Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long short-term memory (LSTM), Deep Belief Network (DBN), and Deep Neural Network (DNN)”. The parameter tuning in these classifiers is done by the same HDCO. The reducer phase extracts data from different chunks by merging the same classes. The developed HDCO-DEL has secured 13.66%, 16.01%, 17.33%, 13.6%, and 14.01% better accuracy than ELM, CNN, LSTM, DBN, DNN, and HealthFog, respectively on second dataset. The comparison with existing methods shows its better performance and also predicts physical activities with overall high accuracy.

AB  - Deep learning has implementations in several disciplines like manufacturing, medical service, farming, and so on. Lately, wearable devices have turned famous with extensive implementations in health monitory system that has accelerated the development of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). IoMT possesses a significant function to perform in lessening the fatality rate by initial diagnosis of illness. The prediction of heart illness remains the main problem in assessing the medical dataset. The proposed study's goal is to identify key characteristics of heart disease prediction using machine learning techniques. Several research works have concentrated on heart illness detection, yet the precision of the outcome is poor. Hence, for enhancing the prediction precision, an IoMT architecture employing Recurrent CONVoluted neural networks (Rec-CONVnet) is proffered for the detection of heart illness. Rec-CONVnet's learning technique relies on gradient-based learning and is prone to becoming stuck in local minima. Age, sex, chest discomfort, blood sugar, Blood pressure (BP), and other factors are acquired from clinical records to estimate the risk of heart disease. Heart state is recognized by classifying acquired sensor data employing Rec-CONVnet. Simulation and assessment are carried out to exhibit that Rec-CONVnet performs marvelously concerning illness prediction. Outcomes of the simulation indicate that Rec-CONVnet prediction paradigm attains finer precision than the rest of the techniques. The proffered Rec-CONVnet attains an F1-score of 97%, FPR of 64.6%, accuracy rate of 96.4%, and precision 76.2%.

AB  - In this article, we propose a smart bedsheet—i-Sheet—for remotely monitoring the health of COVID-19 patients. Typically, real-time health monitoring is very crucial for COVID-19 patients to prevent their health from deteriorating. Conventional healthcare monitoring systems are manual and require patient input to start monitoring health. However, it is difficult for the patients to give input in critical conditions as well as at night. For instance, if the oxygen saturation level decreases during sleep, then it is difficult to monitor. Furthermore, there is a need for a system that monitors post-COVID effects as various vitals get affected, and there are chances of their failure even after the recovery. i-Sheet exploits these features and provides the health monitoring of COVID-19 patients based on their pressure on the bedsheet. It works in three phases: 1) sensing the pressure exerted by the patient on the bedsheet; 2) categorizing the data into groups (comfortable and uncomfortable) based on the fluctuations in the data; and 3) alerting the caregiver about the condition of the patient. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of i-Sheet in monitoring the health of the patient. i-Sheet effectively categorizes the condition of the patient with an accuracy of 99.3% and utilizes 17.5 W of the power. Furthermore, the delay involved in monitoring the health of patients using i-Sheet is 2 s which is very diminutive and is acceptable.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases are considered the number one cause of death across the globe which can be primarily identified by the abnormal heart rhythms of the patients. By generating electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, wearable Internet of Things (IoT) devices can consistently track the patient's heart rhythms. Although Cloud-based approaches for ECG analysis can achieve some levels of accuracy, they still have some limitations, such as high latency. Conversely, the Fog computing infrastructure is more powerful than edge devices but less capable than Cloud computing for executing compositionally intensive data analytic software. The Fog infrastructure can consist of Fog-based gateways directly connected with the wearable devices to offer many advanced benefits, including low latency and high quality of services. To address these issues, a modular one-dimensional convolution neural network (1D-CNN) approach is proposed in this work. The inference module of the proposed approach is deployable over the Fog infrastructure for analysing the ECG signals and initiating the emergency countermeasures within a minimum delay, whereas its training module is executable on the computationally enriched Cloud data centers. The proposed approach achieves the F1-measure score ≈1 on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database when applying GridSearch algorithm with the cross-validation method. This approach has also been implemented on a single-board computer and Google Colab-based hybrid Fog-Cloud infrastructure and embodied to a remote patient monitoring system that shows 25% improvement in the overall response time.

AB  - The objective of this work is the design of a technological platform for remote monitoring of patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). The concept of the framework is a breakthrough in the state of medical, scientific and technological art, aimed at engaging patients in the treatment plan and supporting interaction with healthcare professionals. The proposed platform is able to support a new paradigm for the management of patients with COPD, by integrating clinical data and parameters monitored in daily life using Artificial Intelligence algorithms. Therefore, the doctor is provided with a dynamic picture of the disease and its impact on lifestyle and vice versa, and can thus plan more personalized diagnostics, therapeutics, and social interventions. This strategy allows for a more effective organization of access to outpatient care and therefore a reduction of emergencies and hospitalizations because exacerbations of the disease can be better prevented and monitored. Hence, it can result in improvements in patients' quality of life and lower costs for the healthcare system.

AB  - Chronic illness diagnosis is delayed by the reactive strategies used by existing healthcare systems. This research study proposes a novel Machine Learning (ML) technique for early chronic illness diagnosis and proactive monitoring within a Wearable Body Area Network (WBAN). Unlike the existing system, the proposed system continuously monitors physiological markers in real-time by using WBAN. The proposed system facilitates early diagnosis by analysing data for small variations in usual health patterns. The proposed system integrates data collection, pre-processing, and ML techniques including Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests (RF), including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and real-time anomaly detection. The proposed model has resulted in 95% accuracy, 90% sensitivity, 97% specificity, and 97% AUC, together with better performance, fewer false positive rates and more computing efficiency when compared with the existing system. Reduced false alarms and facilitated quick actions are two ways with which the proposed system improves patient outcomes and lowers medical costs. With such a novel strategy, proactive health care interventions and improved patient care can be implemented.

AB  - According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 15 million infants are born prematurely each year. In the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), the critical health parameters of newborn babies must be monitored precisely and in real time. Approximately one million preterm babies suffer morbidity before the age of five due to preterm birth and complications associated with preterm delivery. The neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) requires accurate, real-time monitoring of newborn infants' vital health parameters. One of the challenges encountered by the majority of hospitals is the lack of systems that can track real-time health parameters and notify doctors and parents to indicate any neonatal critical conditions. This research article presents a framework that incorporates IoT, fog, deep learning technologies, Blockchain, and decentralized cloud for NICU newborn health monitoring. The development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain technologies provides wide opportunities for enhancing the data management of neonatal intensive care units. By integrating IoT devices comprising wearable sensors and smart monitors the system gets real-time data on vital signs like heart rate, temperature, blood oxygen levels, and breathing rate. Fog computing is used for the instantaneous analysis of critical data, and an efficient deep learning algorithm will be implemented at the fog layer to classify data into either critical or non-critical data. Since fog has limited resources, a private blockchain is used to store critical data. The critical data is stored temporarily on a private blockchain and permanently on a decentralized cloud.

AB  - Electrocardiogram (ECG) has been the golden standard for the detection of cardiovascular disease for many years. Any electrical impulse disruption that causes the heart to the contract may lead to arrhythmia. Arrhythmia patients have no indications of having an arrhythmia, but a doctor may recognize arrhythmias in a routine test. Therefore, continuous wearable personal monitoring system plays a big role, and it's become popular day by day. This research focuses on designing and developing a method for predicting arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation) along with monitoring the ECG signals. To create an arrhythmia prediction model and an Android-based real-time ECG surveillance system, Long Short-Term Memories neural network, Recurrent Neural Network, TensorFlow and Keras library are applied here. Those deep learning models and algorithms help to achieve overall 97.57% accuracy on arrhythmia prediction. The system is being designed with Raspberry pi 3, Arduino UNO, AD8232 single lead ECG sensor, HC-05 Bluetooth, biomedical sensor pad and battery. This system will make easier for doctors to monitor the ECG of their patients outside the hospital and also help for remote ECG monitoring. The total components cost of this research work is around USD 58.

AB  - The technical advancements in Mobile communication and the possibility of networking physical devices have made a great impact on the development of real-time monitoring and control applications across various fields. There is a rising demand for online monitoring of the health factors of a patient, who is staying at a remote location and elders suffering from health issues and not able to travel to the hospital. Safeguarding the privacy of the patient data is a paramount challenge while observing patient health conditions through IoT. We have introduced a Real-Time Distant Healthcare Monitoring IoT System (RTDHMIS) which protects the patient data using a lightweight block cipher BEST -1 (Better Encryption Security Technique-1). Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN) comprise many sensor nodes, which are implanted in the patient's body for data collection. Since wearable sensor nodes are resource-constrained devices, it is essential to use a lightweight cryptographic algorithm for data protection. The block cipher BEST -1 provides a good security mechanism against many known security attacks. The security and efficiency of the newly introduced system are compared with related systems and it is found that the performance of RTDHMIS is better for implementation in a healthcare environment.

AB  - Complications affecting the musculoskeletal system and specifically the spine can occur in case of poor postural balance. Monitoring and controlling posture can be predictive of future falls in the elderly population and can also provide indications on the worsening in subjects suffering from neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis. In this context, wearables can be a good solution to ensure immediacy and applicability in the everyday life and a low-cost alternative to gold standard devices, such as the force platform and the stereophotogrammetric system. This work describes the hardware, firmware and software updates of SISTINE, a telemonitoring system based on a pair of sensorized socks and a sensorized belt that is able to monitor physical quantities in real time such as plantar pressures and accelerations of the body segments. A pilot study on posture assessment involved 8 healthy participants recruited at the “F oro Italico” University of Rome. The center of pressure and related parameters, such as the confidence ellipse, were extracted and analysed from the SISTINE system and provided an indication of the effectiveness of the use of the devices in the analysis of posture. The results obtained show that a telemonitoring system based on smart socks and belt can allow an evaluation of the postural balance and provide predictive information on the state of health of the population.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder in which dopaminergic medications, such as levodopa, are typically used to improve motor symptoms and the overall level of people's mobility. To enhance and personalise clinical management, it is important to assess the adherence and impact of pharmacological treatments on motor states (such as ON/OFF/DISKYNESIA, to cite a few). In this context, in addition to clinical assessments performed by PD specialists, it becomes crucial to leverage digital health technologies (e.g., wearable devices) that can collect motor symptoms objectively, continuously and remotely, so as to monitor participants even in an uncontrolled environment. This work aims to implement and validate an automatic motor state identification algorithm based on a novel energy-based composite index capturing mobility and motor symptom fluctuations occurring during the day. This work aims to identify and validate an energy-based composite index, whose evaluation and comparison with a suitable computed threshold can help identifying different motor states and correlate the quantitative information with well-validated clinical scales, to give a double response: i) the efficacy of the pharmacological treatment during daily life (OFF states identification); ii) provide an accurate estimation of the clinical scale index, by computing its value through a function modelling based on energy computation. Preliminary results show that, as regards i), the OFF states were identified with an accuracy of around 98%, while ii) results are presented in terms of clustering robustness (silhouette coefficient of 0.82) and a paired t-test confirming the relation between quantitative computed index and clinical scores. These promising outcomes are opening the way for the development of algorithms able to analyse real-time data from wearable devices to assess disease progression in people with PD.

AB  - Objective: Tracking changes in hemodynamic congestion and the consequent proactive readjustment of treatment has shown efficacy in reducing hospitalizations for patients with heart failure (HF). However, the cost-prohibitive nature of these invasive sensing systems precludes their usage in the large patient population affected by HF. The objective of this research is to estimate the changes in pulmonary artery mean pressure (PAM) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) following vasodilator infusion during right heart catheterization (RHC), using changes in simultaneously recorded wearable seismocardiogram (SCG) signals captured with a small wearable patch. Methods: A total of 20 patients with HF (20% women, median age 55 (interquartile range (IQR), 44-64) years, ejection fraction 24 (IQR, 16-43)) were fitted with a wearable sensing patch and underwent RHC with vasodilator challenge. We divided the dataset randomly into a training–testing set (n = 15) and a separate validation set (n = 5). We developed globalized (population) regression models to estimate changes in PAM and PCWP from the changes in simultaneously recorded SCG. Results: The regression model estimated both pressures with good accuracies: root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of 2.5 mmHg and R2 of 0.83 for estimating changes in PAM, and RMSE of 1.9 mmHg and R2 of 0.93 for estimating changes in PCWP for the training-testing set, and RMSE of 2.7 mmHg and R2 of 0.81 for estimating changes in PAM, and RMSE of 2.9 mmHg and R2 of 0.95 for estimating changes in PCWP for the validation set respectively. Conclusion: Changes in wearable SCG signals may be used to track acute changes in intracardiac hemodynamics in patients with HF. Significance: This method holds promise in tracking longitudinal changes in hemodynamic congestion in hemodynamically-guided remote home monitoring and treatment for patients with HF.

AB  - In this paper, we present an AI-driven lifestyle intervention service for patients with hypertension. The automated intervention platform consists of a remote monitoring system that ingests lifestyle and blood pressure (BP) data and builds a personalized machine learning (ML) model to generate tailored lifestyle recommendations most relevant to each patient's BP. Lifestyle data is collected from a wearable device and questionnaire mobile app which includes activity, sleep, stress and diet information. BP data is remotely collected using at-home BP monitors. With this data, the system trains random forest models that predict BP from lifestyle features and uses Shapley Value analysis to estimate the impact of features on BP. Precise lifestyle recommendations are generated based on the top lifestyle factors for each patient. To test the system's ability to improve BP, we enrolled hypertensive patients into a three-armed clinical trial. During the 6-month trial period, our system provided weekly recommendations to patients in the experimental group. We evaluate the system's effectiveness based on multiple BP improvement metrics and comparison with a control group. Patients in the experimental group experienced an average BP change of −4.0 and −4.7 mmHg for systolic and diastolic BP, respectively, compared to −0.3 and −0.9 mmHg for the control group. Our results demonstrate that the platform can effectively help patients improve their BP through precise lifestyle recommendations.

AB  - IoT(Internet of Things) devices are very useful tools for health monitoring, telehealth and teleconsultation. They bring a very positive added value to the different modes of health intervention. Health is one of the most valuable aspects of our lives. In some countries, especially in developing countries, health facilities are not sufficiently developed to meet the needs of the population for primary health care and emergency response. Therefore, there is a need to replace these gaps with IoT devices that will fill the medical deserts. For this reason, in this article, a general review of the literature on IoT devices for health is done. It results in a proposal for a new type of intelligent medical device to assist patients and health workers equipped with sensors for the automatic collection of patients' physiological data in order to make medical consultation more easily accessible to all and at a distance and, on the other hand, to alleviate the shortage of health workers and, moreover, to free doctors from the repetitive tasks they perform at each examination so that they can concentrate on the care to be administered and the psychological care of patients.

AB  - On account of privacy preserving issue and health-care monitoring, physiological signal biometric authentication system has gained popularity in recent years. Seismocardiogram (SCG) is now easily accessible owing to the advance of wearable sensor technology. However, SCG biometric has not been widely explored due to the challenging motion artifact removal. In this paper, we design placing the sensors at different body parts under different activities to determine the best sensor location. In addition, we develop SCG noise removal algorithm and utilize machine learning approach to perform biometric authentication tasks. We validate the proposed methods on 20 healthy young adults. The dataset contains acceleration data of sitting, standing, walking, and sitting post-exercise activities with the sensor placed at the wrists, neck, heart and sternum. We demonstrate that vertical and dorsal-ventral SCG near the heart and the sternum produce reliable SCG biometric evidenced by achieving the state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, we present the efficacy of the devised noise removal procedure in the authentication during walking motion.Clinical relevance— A seismocardiography-based biometric authentication system can help serve privacy preserving and reveal cardiovascular functioning information in clinics.

AB  - Never before has the demand for non-contact tools for care of health monitoring been more obvious or evident. Digital camera vital sign measurement (RR, HR, SPo2, and BP) utilizes imaging technologies to analyse photos of the human and compute physiological changes. Since the ubiquitous adoption of digital cameras in all fields, innovations in optics, machine learning, and computer vision have been made. The non-contact monitoring of vital signs may be advantageous in a variety of disciplines of application, from clinical and healthcare settings to vocational and sports activities. This study gives a thorough assessment of camera assessment of physiological vital signs (RR, HR, SPo2, and BP). The viability of camera-used devices and systems in the visible range (380-750nm) for numbers are usually retrieved from videos contains few uncovered body areas (involves the face, hands and torso) with appropriate post processing techniques has been the subject of previous research. We gives an analysis of the physiological and development work for the assessment of vital signs like heart rate, blood oxygen saturation, blood pressure, and respiration rate from digital images in this review. We also discussed possible applications for these technologies. The summaries of findings from numerous applications or validation studies were presented, together with the justification for the measurement, a categorization of the various post-processing techniques used for source images. To encourage the progress of technology, more study is required.

AB  - In next-generation network architecture, the Cybertwin drove the sixth generation of cellular networks sixth-generation (6G) to play an active role in many applications, such as healthcare and computer vision. Although the previous sixth-generation (5G) network provides the concept of edge cloud and core cloud, the internal communication mechanism has not been explained with a specific application. This article introduces a possible Cybertwin based multimodal network (beyond 5G) for electrocardiogram (ECG) patterns monitoring during daily activity. This network paradigm consists of a cloud-centric network and several Cybertwin communication ends. The Cybertwin nodes combine support locator/identifier identification, data caching, behavior logger, and communications assistant in the edge cloud. The application focuses on monitoring the ECG patterns during daily activity because few studies analyze them under different motions. We present a novel deep convolutional neural network based human activity recognition classifier to enhance identification accuracy. The healthcare monitoring values and potential clinical medicine are provided by the Cybertwin based network for ECG patterns observing.

AB  - To track vital signs on the wrist, a wearable system, named WrisTee, has been developed for remote health monitoring. Using three optical sensors with four light sources, WrisTee allows users to measure 12 photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals at three locations on the radial artery. Two types of PPG signals with opposite polarities were discovered and designated as in-phase and invert-phase signals. We provided a unified viewpoint regarding their differences based on the Beer $-$ Lambert law, and showed that both signals can be used for heart monitoring using data analyzed from a selected subject. Using reflective pulse-transition time (R-PTT) and the standard deviation of R-PTT ($\sigma _{R\text{-}PTT}$), we proposed a method for selecting the optimal wavelength to achieve the best quality signal, thus minimizing storage requirements, power resources, and computational costs. We conducted an experiment on ten subjects to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed method. Our results demonstrated that WrisTee is capable of finding the optimal positions and wavelengths for monitoring vital signs. To automatically detect the PPG phases, six machine learning (ML) models were explored to assess their accuracy for PPG-phase classification. The experimental results show that a convolutional neural network can be the best candidate for phase classification. Hence, it can be integrated into WrisTee for noninvasive health monitoring such as heart rate, heart rate variability, or blood pressure. Our work paves a new direction in bio-signal medical researches by adopting in-phase and invert-phase PPGs for healthcare monitoring.

AB  - Integrated sensing and communication technologies provide essential sensing capabilities that address pressing challenges in remote health monitoring systems. However, most of today’s systems remain obtrusive, requiring users to wear devices, interfering with people’s daily activities, and often raising privacy concerns. Herein, we present HealthDAR, a low-cost, contactless, and easy-to-deploy health monitoring system. Specifically, HealthDAR encompasses three interventions: 1) symptom early detection (monitoring of vital signs and cough detection); 2) tracking and social distancing; and 3) preventive measures (monitoring of daily activities, such as face-touching and hand-washing). HealthDAR has three key components: 1) a low-cost, low-energy, and compact integrated radar system; 2) a simultaneous signal processing combined deep learning (SSPDL) network for cough detection; and 3) a deep learning method for the classification of daily activities. Through performance tests involving multiple subjects across uncontrolled environments, we demonstrate HealthDAR’s practical utility for health monitoring.

AB  - QT prolongation often leads to fatal arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. Antiarrhythmic drugs can increase the risk of QT prolongation and therefore require strict post-administration monitoring and dosage control. Measurement of the QT interval from the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) by a trained expert, in a clinical setting, is the accepted method for tracking QT prolongation. Recent advances in wearable ECG technology, however, raise the possibility of automated out-of-hospital QT tracking. Applications of Deep Learning (DL) - a subfield within Machine Learning - in ECG analysis holds the promise of automation for a variety of classification and regression tasks. In this work, we propose a residual neural network, QTNet, for the regression of QT intervals from a single lead (Lead-I) ECG. QTNet is trained in a supervised manner on a large ECG dataset from a U.S. hospital. We demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of QTNet on four test-sets; one from the same hospital, one from another U.S. hospital, and two public datasets. Over all four datasets, the mean absolute error (MAE) in the estimated QT interval ranges between 9ms and 15.8ms. Pearson correlation coefficients vary between 0.899 and 0.914. By contrast, QT interval estimation on these datasets with a standard method for automated ECG analysis (NeuroKit2) yields MAEs between 22.29ms and 90.79ms, and Pearson correlation coefficients 0.345 and 0.620. These results demonstrate the utility of QTNet across distinct datasets and patient populations, thereby highlighting the potential utility of DL models for ubiquitous QT tracking.Clinical Relevance— QTNet can be applied to inpatient or ambulatory Lead-I ECG signals to track QT intervals. The method facilitates ambulatory monitoring of patients at risk of QT prolongation.

AB  - A new smart fabric method to monitor the healing of wounds is presented. This system merges Artificial Neural Network (ANN) concepts with personal tracking of health technology. The purpose of the system is to facilitate the healing of wounds. The innovation of THE Raspberry Pi is used in conjunction with sensors that are implanted in textiles in order to gather data in real time about the internal temperature of wounds, the levels of wetness, and infection indicators. On the basis of this data, a training model is created in order to give forecasting insights into the consequences of wound healing. Applying an expansive dataset, which particularly displays the neural network's ability to distinguish unique healing patterns, is the method that is used to verify the correctness of the neural network. In addition to providing continuous monitoring, the wearable gadget also makes it simpler to recognize problems at an earlier stage in their development. The adaptability of smart materials and the capacity for forecasting of ANN have been combined in this one-of-a-kind technology, which provides a possible route for managing the management of healing wounds that is both customized and efficient.

AB  - Recent advances in remote health monitoring systems have significantly benefited patients and played a crucial role in improving their quality of life. However, while physiological health-focused solutions have demonstrated increasing success and maturity, mental health-focused applications have seen comparatively limited success in spite of the fact that stress and anxiety disorders are among the most common issues people deal with in their daily lives. In the hopes of furthering progress in this domain through the development of a more robust analytic framework for the measurement of indicators of mental health, we propose a multi-modal semi-supervised framework for tracking physiological precursors of the stress response. Our methodology enables utilizing multi-modal data of differing domains and resolutions from wearable devices and leveraging them to map short-term episodes to semantically efficient embeddings for a given task. Additionally, we leverage an inter-modality contrastive objective, with the advantages of rendering our framework both modular and scalable. The focus on optimizing both local and global aspects of our embeddings via a hierarchical structure renders transferring knowledge and compatibility with other devices easier to achieve. In our pipeline, a task-specific pooling based on an attention mechanism, which estimates the contribution of each modality on an instance level, computes the final embeddings for observations. This additionally provides a thorough diagnostic insight into the data characteristics and highlights the importance of signals in the broader view of predicting episodes annotated per mental health status. We perform training experiments using a corpus of real-world data on perceived stress, and our results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in performance improvements.

AB  - The IoT has applications in many areas such as manufacturing, healthcare, and agriculture, to name a few. Recently, wearable devices have become popular with wide applications in the health monitoring system which has stimulated the growth of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). The IoMT has an important role to play in reducing the mortality rate by the early detection of disease. The prediction of heart disease is a key issue in the analysis of clinical dataset. The aim of the proposed investigation is to identify the key characteristics of heart disease prediction using machine learning techniques. Many studies have focused on heart disease diagnosis, but the accuracy of the findings is low. Therefore, to improve prediction accuracy, an IoMT framework for the diagnosis of heart disease using modified salp swarm optimization (MSSO) and an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is proposed. The proposed MSSO-ANFIS improves the search capability using the Levy flight algorithm. The regular learning process in ANFIS is dependent on gradient-based learning and has a tendency to become trapped in local minima. The learning parameters are optimized utilizing MSSO to provide better results for ANFIS. The following information is taken from medical records to predict the risk of heart disease: blood pressure (BP), age, sex, chest pain, cholesterol, blood sugar, etc. The heart condition is identified by classifying the received sensor data using MSSO-ANFIS. A simulation and analysis is conducted to show that MSSA-ANFIS works well in relation to disease prediction. The results of the simulation demonstrate that the MSSO-ANFIS prediction model achieves better accuracy than the other approaches. The proposed MSSO-ANFIS prediction model obtains an accuracy of 99.45 with a precision of 96.54, which is higher than the other approaches.

AB  - Early diagnosis of diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular, diabetes, HIV, AIDS, Lyme, and tuberculosis can enable timely treatment, which enhances efficacy and helps reduce the severity and mortality while lowering overall healthcare costs. Predictive analytics is an emerging approach that comprehends trends in patient data to identify patterns in patient data, detect subtle signs of diseases, and enable early diagnosis for more effective treatment. However, traditional predictive diagnosis approaches rely on statistical models that are contingent on the data’s average pattern and are unable to capture the data’s inherent patterns, leading to ineffective and inaccurate diagnoses. In this paper, we introduce a novel Artificial Spider Monkey-based Random Forest (ASM-RF) hybrid framework that combines the predictive analytics of a Random Forest algorithm with Artificial Intelligence to evaluate patient health data, spot patterns, diagnose modest indications, and automate intelligent decisions for enhancing the healthcare system. The proposed ASM-RF hybrid framework employs a fitness function to evaluate the spider monkey’s performance at the classification layer and update accuracy and recall, resulting in more accurate patient disease diagnoses and automating timely treatment decisions for improving the overall healthcare system. Moreover, we use Identity-based Encryption (IBE), which enables the encryption of data with private and public keys coupled with users’ identities as the encryption keys, assisting in enhancing the security of the healthcare system. A dataset collected from three different IoT sensor devices, ten participants, and twelve activities is employed to simulate the proposed ASM-RF hybrid framework, which is then contrasted to cutting-edge predictive diagnostic algorithms in terms of accuracy, precision, Area under the Curve, execution time, recall, and F-measure. The proposed method exhibits superior performance when compared to conventional methods, as evidenced by its exceptional accuracy (99.52%), precision (99.12%), Area Under the Curve (AUC) (99.00%), recall (99.22%), F-measure (97.12%), and significantly reduced execution time (6s).

AB  - Telemedicine consists in the delivery of health care services, where patients and providers are separated by distance. Telemonitoring facilities play an important role in remote assistance programs, particularly in assisting patients suffering from chronic afflictions, such as phlebopathic diseases (e.g. chronic venous disease and diabetic foot). When these pathologies worsen, complications can be serious. In fact, foot deformities lead to variations of plantar load, formation of ulcers and, in the worst case, to amputation. Consequently, these pathologies cause huge expenses for the health care system. We propose a framework for screening and early detection of phlebopathic diseases insurgence, based on dynamic tests for functional assessment where patients wear sensorized socks. Socks used in this study integrate force and inertial sensors to provide information on plantar pressures and person's movement. We show results of a feasibility study including 42 patients, with a balance of 21 healthy patients and 21 with phlebopathic diseases. Data gathered from wearables were automatically elaborated through machine learning techniques in order to obtain a binary classifier identifying whether or not a patient shows pathological gait. Results show that our best classifier has high positive predictive value and high sensitivity, with F1-score equal to 92.1%.

AB  - More adaptable and user-independent techniques are required for multi-sensors based daily locomotion detection (MS-DLD). This research study proposes a couple of locomotion detection methods using body-worn multi-sensors to successfully categorize several locomotion transitions. This research presents both standard and state-of-the-art methods for MS-DLD. Conventionally, to improve MS-DLD process, the proposed methodology consists of a wavelet transformed Quaternion-based filter for the inertial signals, patterns recognition in the form of kinematic-static energies, and state-of-the-art multi-features extraction. These features include entropy, spectral, and cepstral coefficients domains. Then, fuzzy logic-based optimization has been introduced in order to achieve the selective features by converting them into codewords. These nominated features with enhanced patterns are further detected by HMMs to improve the accuracy for classifying daily life locomotion actions. This paper also introduces another state-of-the-art way to model daily locomotion detection and derives body-specific modified HMMs. The model divides the sensor data into three active body-specific parts including head sensors, mid-body sensors, and lower body sensors. Body-specific modified HMMs have been provided with raw data for the three active body-specific sensors and gave better results with less computational complexities when compared to the conventional methods. The proposed systems have been experimentally assessed and trialed over three diverse publicly available datasets: the UP-Fall dataset consisting of falling and other daily life activities, the IM-WSHA dataset comprising everyday locomotion actions, and the ENABL3S gait and locomotion dataset consisting of multiple gait movements. Experimental outcomes indicate that the proposed conventional technique achieved improved results and outperformed existing systems based on detection accuracies of 90.0% and 87.5% over UP-Fall, 86.0% and 88.3% over IM-WSHA, and 86.7% and 90.0% over ENABL3S datasets for kinematic and static energy patterns, respectively. Further, the results show that the state-of-the-art body-specific modified HMMs method achieved 94.3% and 95.0% over UP-Fall, 92.0% and 93.3% over IM-WSHA, and 90.0% and 95.0% over ENABL3S datasets for kinematic and static patterned signals, respectively. The results of state-of-the-art efficient system show a significant increase in detection accuracy when compared to standard systems.

AB  - Respiratory rate (RR) is an important biomarker as RR changes can reflect severe medical events, such as heart disease, lung disease, and sleep disorders. Unfortunately, standard manual RR counting is prone to human error and cannot be performed continuously. This study proposes a method for continuously estimating RR, RRWaveNet. The method is a compact end-to-end deep learning model which does not require feature engineering and can use low-cost raw photoplethysmography (PPG) as input signal. RRWaveNet was tested subject-independently and compared to baseline in four data sets (BIDMC, CapnoBase, WESAD, and SensAI) and using three window sizes (16, 32, and 64 s). RRWaveNet outperformed current state-of-the-art methods with mean absolute errors at an optimal window size of 1.66 ± 1.01, 1.59 ± 1.08, 1.92 ± 0.96, and 1.23 ± 0.61 breaths per minute for each data set. In remote monitoring settings, such as in the WESAD and SensAI data sets, we apply transfer learning to improve the performance using two other ICU data sets as pretraining data sets, reducing the MAE by up to 21%. This shows that this model allows accurate and practical estimation of RR on affordable and wearable devices. Our study also shows feasibility of remote RR monitoring in the context of telemedicine and at home.

AB  - The novel Coronavirus outbreak has affected more than 61 million cases in around 218 countries and Territories. Covid-19 is life-threatening for those with chronic health conditions and for the elderly. The COVID-19 pandemic has created a situation where everyone has a need to monitor their health. The proposed system has a real-time monitoring of ECG (QRS complex), lung acoustics, pulse rate, body temperature, oxygen saturation of the blood and lung capacity. These vitals are monitored using various sensor devices. A smart, AI based symptom classifier is used to assess the user's condition. An immediate alert system is triggered when the user needs medical attention. The data is backed up in a SD card for any future reference. The proposed system can effectively monitor all the body vital values in real time using biosensor devices and update the real time body vitals. An all-in-one prototype is developed catering to COVID-19 detection in a non-invasive way with affordable cost compared to existing techniques.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of remote patient monitoring, particularly for those suffering from chronic illnesses. Such individuals require continuous monitoring to ensure the stability of their condition and prevent complications. However, traditional methods of patient monitoring can be invasive, time-consuming, and often result in patients feeling limited in their daily activities. The development of intelligent monitoring systems based on Internet of Things technologies has the potential to revolutionize the way chronic illness is managed. These systems can be integrated with wearable/portable devices and other sensors to track vital signs in real-time. This information can then be transmitted to healthcare providers for review, allowing for early detection of any changes or potential issues. The benefits of such systems are numerous. They provide patients with increased freedom and mobility, as they no longer need to visit a healthcare facility for regular check-ups. They also reduce the workload for healthcare providers, freeing up time for more critical cases. Furthermore, they can result in cost savings for healthcare systems by reducing the need for hospitalization. This work introduces the SMART CARE project that aims to develop an integrated monitoring system consisting of hardware and software components that can make the various phases of managing a patient with chronic heart failure (prevention, diagnosis, therapy, follow-up) more efficient. The paper provides the main information on the project and presents and describes the system architecture of the proposed solution.

AB  - The upcoming era of wearable health monitoring devices has created a need for automated signal processing algorithms that can be trained with a minimal amount of labeled data. In our previous work, we showed that transfer learning techniques like semi-supervised adversarial domain adaptation can help to achieve this. We applied our method to remote sleep monitoring, by performing sleep staging on single-channel wearable EEG signals. In this work, we propose data augmentation to help in tackling this challenge. By using an artificially increased amount of labeled data, our semi-supervised adversarial domain adaptation method improves its performance on the wearable EEG data. The accuracy is increased consistently by 0.6% to 1.4% relative to the results without augmentation. As both adversarial domain adaptation and data augmentation are strategies to deal with the scarceness of data, we conclude that these methods are can effectively be combined to surpass their individual performance.

AB  - The real-time and accurate detection of premature ventricular contractions (PVC) in patients is of great significance for preventing the occurrence of high-risk events such as sudden cardiac death and guiding cardiac surgical procedures such as radiofrequency ablation. To improve the diagnostic accuracy and real-time performance, and expand application scenarios, an economical wearable PVC real-time auxiliary diagnosis system based on the multi-parameter squeeze excitation residual network (MP-SE-ResNet) is proposed. We have realized the real-time acquisition, processing, and wireless transmission of dynamic ECGs based on ESP32, furthermore, realized the PVCs recognition based on MP-SE-ResNet. Using the lead-II ECGs in the MIT-BIH arrhythmia databases as training samples, and the network was evaluated using the remainder of this dataset and data recorded by our device, respectively. The accuracy of the MIT-BIH dataset reached 99.34%, and the sensitivity and specificity of PVC recognition reached 98.26% and 99.64%, respectively. Using the ECGs recorded by our system, we achieved the following results: the accuracy was 94.07%, the sensitivity and specificity of PVC were 92.76% and 97.63%, respectively. The experimental results show that the system meets the requirements of remote monitoring and auxiliary diagnosis. Therefore, it provides a new method and design idea for wearable remote arrhythmia monitoring and auxiliary diagnosis.

AB  - People's inherent ability tends to deteriorate as they get older, and their health problems get more complicated and chronic. As people get older, multimorbidity—the simultaneous occurrence of many chronic conditions becomes more common. Health systems around the world struggle to adapt to the great range of physical and mental abilities of older people and to encourage good trajectories of healthy aging from an early age. The abilities of an older person can change quickly—in some circumstances, over the course of hours. Care systems struggle to adapt rapidly enough to meet a person's changing demands. As a result of the impending lack of healthcare workers qualified to provide for senior citizens, adopting elder-friendly technologies may level the playing field in the industry. A decision support system can send alerts to elderly people, their family members, and carers, recommending the necessary interventions to halt further health deterioration, based on the statistically significant changes that can be found in daily records using a combination of modern data mining techniques. This study examines the most recent Internet of Things (IoT) technology can assist carers in improving the health, safety, and quality of life of independent elderly persons. The system is based on the behavior of senior citizens at home.

AB  - Dementia is the main cause of disability in elderly populations. It has been shown that the risk factors of dementia are a mixture of pathological, lifestyle and heritable factors, with some of those being provably modifiable. Early diagnosis of dementia and approaches to slow down its evolution are currently the most prominent management methodologies due to lack of a cure. For that reason, a plethora of home-based assistive technologies for dementia management do exist, with most of them focusing on the improvement of memory and thinking. The main objective of LETHE is prevention in the whole spectrum of cognitive decline in the elderly population at risk reaching from asymptomatic to subjective or mild cognitive impairment to prodromal Dementia. LETHE will provide a Big Data collection platform and analysis system, that will allow prevention, personalized risk detection and intervention on cognitive decline. Through the subsequent 2-year clinical trial, the LETHE system, as well as the respective knowledge gained will be evaluated and validated. The scope of the current paper is to introduce the LETHE study and its respective novel platform as a holistic approach to multidomain lifestyle intervention trial studies. The present work depicts the architectural perspective and extends beyond state-of-the-art guidelines and approaches to health management systems and cloud platform development.Clinical Relevance — Patient Management Systems as well as lifestyle management platforms have significant clinical relevance as they allow for remote and continuous monitoring of patients' health status. LETHE aims to improve patient outcomes by providing predictive models for cognitive decline and patient adherence to the multimodal lifestyle intervention, enabling prompt and appropriate medical decisions.

AB  - These days cloud-based infrastructure is facing many challenges, out of which the major issue is their syncing data before cutover and data migration. Due to the limited scalability in terms of security concerns of cloud computing, the need for a centralized IoTs based environment has been constrained to a limited extent. The sensitivity of device latency emerged during healthy systems such as health monitoring, etc. is the main reason, because healthy systems require computing operations on high-volume data. Fog computing provides an innovative solution to improve the performance of cloud computing, providing the ability to take the necessary resources and those that are closer to the end-users. Existing fog computing models retain several limitations, such as either considering result accuracy or overestimating response time, but managing both together impairs system compatibility. FETCH is a proposed framework that integrates with edge computing devices to work on deep learning technology and automated monitoring and offers a highly useful framework for real-life health care systems such as heart disease and more. The proposed Fog-enabled cloud computing framework uses FogBus, which demonstrates utility in the form of consumption of power, network bandwidth, jitter, latency, process execution time, and their accuracy as well.

AB  - Goal: Smartphone and wearable devices may act as powerful tools to remotely monitor physical function in people with neurodegenerative and autoimmune diseases from out-of-clinic environments. Detection of progression onset or worsening of symptoms is especially important in people living with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) in order to enable optimally adapted therapeutic strategies. MS symptoms typically follow subtle and fluctuating disease courses, patient-to-patient, and over time. Current in-clinic assessments are often too infrequently administered to reflect longitudinal changes in MS impairment that impact daily life. This work, therefore, explores how smartphones can administer daily two-minute walking assessments to monitor PwMS physical function at home. Methods: Remotely collected smartphone inertial sensor data was transformed through state-of-the-art Deep Convolutional Neural Networks, to estimate a participant's daily ambulatory-related disease severity, longitudinally over a 24-week study. Results: This study demonstrated that smartphone-based ambulatory severity outcomes could accurately estimate MS level of disability, as measured by the EDSS score ($r^{2}$: 0.56,$p< $0.001). Furthermore, longitudinal severity outcomes were shown to accurately reflect individual participants' level of disability over the study duration. Conclusion: Smartphone-based assessments, that can be performed by patients from their home environments, could greatly augment standard in-clinic outcomes for neurodegenerative diseases. The ability to understand the impact of disease on daily-life between clinical visits, through objective digital outcomes, paves the way forward to better measure and identify signs of disease progression that may be occurring out-of-clinic, to monitor how different patients respond to various treatments, and to ultimately enable the development of better, and more personalised care.

AB  - Technology adoption in healthcare services has resulted in advancing care delivery services and improving the experiences of patients. This paper presents research that aims to find the important requirements for a remote monitoring system for patients with COVID-19. As this pandemic is growing more and more, there is a critical need for such systems. In this paper, the requirements and the value are determined for the proposed system, which integrates a smart bracelet that helps to signal patient vital signs. (376) participants completed the online quantitative survey. According to the study results, Most Healthcare Experts, (97.9%) stated that the automated wearable device is very useful, it plays an essential role in routine healthcare tasks (in early diagnosis, quarantine enforcement, and patient status monitoring), and it simplifies their routine healthcare activities. I addition, the main vital signs based on their expert opinion should include temperature (66% of participants) and oxygenation level (95% of participants). These findings are essential to any academic and industrial future efforts to develop these vital wearable systems. The future work will involve implementing the design based on the results of this study and use machine-learning algorithm to better detect the COVID-19 cases based on the monitoring of vital signs and symptoms.

AB  - Traditional healthcare systems are difficult to provide low-latency patient monitoring services for multiple patients. However, with the widespread application of novel technologies such as cloud computing, Internet of things(loT), 5G wireless communication, health industry is gradually walking into the era of smart and precise medical services with powerful healthcare cloud. Specifically, this kind of promising healthcare system which is based on cloud computing and loT, makes low-latency and multiple patients monitoring service possible, which signif- icantly improves patient's medical experience and doctor's fast access to patient's real-time data of vital signs for later precise diagnosis and analysis. Nonetheless, how to satisfy the low latency requirement while notably reducing the use of communication resource and computation resource of healthcare private cloud that has expensive cost is still a challenging problem. In this paper, we apply reinforcement learning(RL) algorithm which will learn a policy to automatically adjust transmission rate of monitoring services and computation resources of cloud servers, in conjunction with effective two-stage tandem queue system to tackle the above problem. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method in cloud computing based healthcare system.

AB  - A Wireless Medical Sensor Network (WMSN) connects autonomous nodes such as (sensors and actuators) existing on the body, or under a person's skin. The network usually extends over the entire human body and nodes are connected via a wireless communication channel. WMSN sense human physiological signs and monitor a patient's health status. The framework and preliminary experiment on developing an anomaly detection model for ubiquitous patient and healthcare monitoring in medical wireless sensor networks (MWSN s)were presented in this study. The architecture is a combination of an improved data mining method and machine learning algorithms using modern fusion methods. Being that MWSNs are highly susceptible to failures due to certain limitations, such as low energy resources, poor reliability, low computational resources, and considerable susceptibility to post-deployment security attacks, the proposed model is an anomaly detection method for MWSNs for the detection of anomalies in an adaptive manner with high accuracy while maintaining resource constraints using two phases. First, an anomaly-based detection model was created using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique to reduce dimensionality, prevent overfitting, and increase detection accuracy. Second, the detection accuracy of the proposed model was evaluated and compare before and after PCA integration. The experimental study showed that the proposed model can rapidly identify sensor anomalies with high accuracy.

AB  - The current technique for checking patients in hospitals keeps patients attached to their beds and can be awkward for patients to wear. The quantity of medical caretakers in the labour force is additionally expected to decrease by 2020, causing strain in a climate where overabundance pressure can prompt stress mishaps happening to patients. The objective of this project was to deliver a remote patient monitoring and future analysis framework that could permit patients to be versatile in their current circumstance. The created framework incorporates a heartbeat oximeter to gauge blood oxygen fixation and the patient's heartbeat, just as a temperature sensor to monitor the patient's temperature. Other physiological boundaries, for example, internal heat level, breath rate, and anomalous heart beat through Heart rate sensor and so forth these physiological boundaries are level changed over and communicated through UART directly fetched to the cloud. The objective of the proposed module is to screen the boundaries adequately through Thing Speak IOT platform and dependent on basic qualities, the ready framework is created to give alert on crisis conditions. The patient monitoring system designed here not only used for monitoring purpose also developed a software module to control the limitations and data collected from the patients are further fetched to analyse the critical happenings based on the pattern of abnormality.

This method is used to overcome the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic in validating the model design to be implemented. One of the main advantages of the Model Development Engineering (MDE) approach is that all models produced are formal extensions of the Unified Modeling Language (UML). MDE is a system used to build a framework for organizing, planning, and controlling the information systems development process. In the verification stage of the Digital Health model, the presentation stage is adopted which involves two approaches, namely the design approach and the system approach. The design approach adopts Model Driven Engineering (MDE), which is used in the development of system architecture. The results of this study are the model designs used to adjust validation in developing digital health models using the Model Development Engineering technique.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) has become one of the most significant instruments for pervasive and intelligent systems for automated diagnostics in the healthcare industry. This study suggests creating sophisticated monitoring systems for mother and foetal signals in high-risk pregnancies. The suggested system employs several sensors, including an ECG sensor, FHR sensor, and UC sensor, all of which are coupled to a microcontroller unit. The MCU analyses the sensor data and sends it wirelessly to a web server, which is presented on a graphical user interface after being processed by the web server.

AB  - Despite being the fastest growing Neurodegenerative disease in the world, with over ten million cases worldwide, there is no definitive diagnosis method for Parkinson’s Disease currently. Current diagnosis technologies misdiagnose one in four patients, relying on tests and technologies that are subjective to the administrating clinicians. Furthermore, they are inaccessible to billions due to immobility, geographic barriers, or associated costs. With early and accurate diagnosis being vital to effective treatment, a tremendous issue emerges. ParkinSense addresses these issues, serving as an automated web application that contactlessly analyzes three cardinal symptoms of Parkinson’s Disease over a standard webcam and microphone: Hypomimia, Dysarthria, and Bradykinesia. With Ensemble Learning coupled with various classifiers, ParkinSense was able to achieve an accuracy rate of 99.72% when tested on synthetic patients. By examining and combining multiple modalities, ParkinSense boasts accuracy rates higher than many advanced unimodal technologies, as patients often do not substantially display all the symptoms of Parkinson’s Disease, leading to misdiagnosis when relying on one symptom for diagnosis. Furthermore, ParkinSense is able to accurately estimate disease severity for positively diagnosed patients, with a Mean Absolute Error of 9.7 on the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale. ParkinSense strongly suggests that an entirely contactless diagnosis of Parkinson’s Disease through digital biomarkers can be effective, and web applications can be utilized for rapid, automated, and remote diagnosis and severity analysis, which can be crucial for those affected by barriers that prevent access to healthcare.

AB  - The rapid proliferation of sensors, mobile devices, wireless connectivity and data availability, have influenced medicine significantly. There is a strong bond between Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve the quality of healthcare, turning traditional into smart healthcare. Their convergence offers great opportunities, can improve patient outcomes, reduce medical errors, lower costs, overcome the existing medical systems limitations and avoid the degeneration of harmful situations. Despite these potential benefits, these new opportunities introduce some troubles. The focus of the paper is power management of IoT devices, as they are battery-operated and energy saving become one of the biggest concerns in this field. We propose an architecture enriched by a power-aware strategy, that taking into account the energy availability of the devices, allows to collect and analyze huge volumes of heterogeneous clinical data in order to monitor health status of patients and improve clinical decision. The proposed strategy consists of two main elements, a distributed service to logically sort IoT devices, and an allocation algorithm for distributing the computational load among that devices. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the approach able to achieve energy savings by means of the proposed power-aware strategy.

AB  - The quantification of physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE) offers significant benefits for healthcare monitoring and has the potential to promote healthy and active aging for elderly individuals. With recent advancements in quantum information and computation, quantum machine learning (QML) has emerged as a powerful tool capable of improving upon the measurement of PAEE. In this study, we propose a hybrid machine-learning model to predict PAEE. This model specifically leverages a classical long short-term memory (LSTM) model integrated with a variational quantum circuit (VQC). This model, which we refer to as the enhanced quantum long short-term memory linear (eQLSTML) model, was subsequently trained and tested using the publicly available GOTOV Human Physical Activity and Energy Expenditure Dataset for Older Individuals. Upon performance comparisons between the classical LSTM and proposed eQLSTML models, our findings suggest that the eQLSTML modeling approach demonstrates superior performance compared to classical machine learning methods, thereby holding a promise for personalized healthcare monitoring and promoting healthy aging in the older population.

AB  - Objective: Ambulatory monitoring of ground reaction force (GRF) and center of pressure (CoP) could improve management of health conditions that impair mobility. Insoles instrumented with force-sensitive resistors (FSRs) are an unobtrusive, low-cost, and low-power technology for sampling GRF and CoP in real-world environments. However, FSRs have variable response characteristics that complicate estimation of GRF and CoP. This study introduces a unique data analytic pipeline that enables accurate estimation of GRF and CoP despite relatively inaccurate FSR responses. This paper also investigates whether inclusion of a complementary knee angle sensor improves estimation accuracy. Methods: Seventeen healthy subjects were equipped with an insole instrumented with six FSRs and a string-based knee angle sensor. Subjects walked in a straight line at self-selected slow, preferred, and fast speeds over an in-ground force platform. Twenty repetitions were performed for each speed. Supervised machine learning models estimated weight-normalized GRF and shoe size-normalized CoP, which were re-scaled to obtain GRF and CoP. Results: Anteroposterior GRF, Vertical GRF, and Anteroposterior CoP were estimated with a normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of less than 5%. Mediolateral GRF and CoP were estimated with an NRMSE of 8.1% and 6.4%, respectively. Knee angle-related features slightly improved GRF estimates. Conclusion: Normalized models accurately estimated GRF and CoP despite deficiencies in FSR data. Significance: Ambulatory use of the proposed system could enable objective, longitudinal monitoring of severity and progression for a variety of health conditions.

AB  - Continuous remote monitoring of key health parameters can be facilitated by noninvasive cardiovascular signals such as the seismocardiogram (SCG) and electrocardiogram (ECG). However, the accuracy of health parameter estimation is dependent on the quality of the signals collected and the algorithms used, which can be particularly challenging in the presence of environmental noise and motion artifacts. In this work, SeismoNet, a highly-sensitive, low-power, multi-node wireless wearable platform is introduced that enables recording of small amplitude acceleration signals (especially SCG signals) and ECG from multiple points on the human body. Using the SeismoNet, we performed a study involving 20 human participants with five nodes placed around the trunk, and showed that combining multiple nodes can improve the estimation performance of heart rate (HR) and respiration rate (RR) by approximately 30% and 23%, respectively. This suggests that combining acceleration data from multiple points on the body can enhance the cardiac and respiratory content of the acquired data, resulting in more accurate predictions. Furthermore, the SeismoNet platform and the dataset collected can be utilized to explore research questions related to multi-point physiological sensing.

AB  - This paper describes a nursing robot named RI-YA-NA developed for measuring human body temperature and monitoring heart rate. Robots are an emerging field of research and development aimed at providing assistance to healthcare professionals. These intelligent machines are mainly designed to take care of the elderly patients, physically disabled patients, patients having contagious diseases such as Covid-19, and also remote area patients where doctors and nurses cannot go instantly. In our robot we have used ECG measurement module for monitoring heart rate and Contactless temperature sensor using Infrared radiation. The nursing robot will record these data and send them to the web page from where the doctor can access the information and take necessary steps. The nursing robot's performance in measuring body temperature and heart rate could be compared with that of traditional measurement methods, such as oral thermometers and pulse oximeters, to determine its utility in a clinical setting.

The literature review surveys existing re-search on ML algorithms and loT devices, revealing challenges in accuracy, portability, and cost-effectiveness. Building upon this, the proposed model employs the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for non-invasive glucose monitoring, utilizing MAX30100 sensors and ESP32 microcontrollers for real-time predictions. Cloud computing is integrated through Digilocker, ensuring secure storage and offline accessibility of sensitive health data. The loT parts include MAX30100 sensors, ESP32 micro-controllers, a 16x2 LCD screen, and Power Supply vl.2, forming the core of the continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system. Implementation strategies involve data aggregation, visualization, and analysis, with considerations for challenges such as limited data storage and app integration. The model aims to provide an effective and user-friendly CGM system, addressing existing challenges and empowering elderly diabetic patients with real-time insights into their glucose levels. The paper concludes by discussing the potential impact of the proposed model on diabetes management and emphasizing the need for further research and development to enhance its capabilities.

AB  - Ischemic heart disease (IHD), a critical and dreadful cardiovascular disease, is a leading cause of death globally. The steady progress of IHD leads to an irreversible condition called myocardial infarction (MI). The detection of MI can be done by observing the altered electrocardiogram (ECG) characteristics. Often, automated ECG analysis is preferred in place of visual inspection to reduce time and ensure reliable detection even when the recording quality is not very good. This paper presents an automated approach to classify recent MI, past MI, and normal sinus rhythm (NSR) classes based on the morphological features of the ECG. In clinical practice, a standard 12-lead ECG setup is typically employed to identify MI. However, acquiring a 12-lead ECG is not always convenient. Hence, in this study, we have explored the possibility of using a minimal number of ECG leads by deriving the augmented limb leads using leads I and II. A well-known and widely used ensemble machine learning tool, the random forest (RF) classifier is trained using features extracted from the derived augmented limb leads and their combinations. An RF classifier built using features extracted from all limb leads has outperformed classifiers built on combinations of them with five-fold cross-validation training accuracy of 97.9 (±0.008) % and testing accuracy of 98 %.Clinical relevance— As high sensitivity is reported in identifying recent MI and past MI classes, the proposed approach is suitable for preventative healthcare applications since it is less likely that subjects with recent or past MI will be misclassified. Due to its low computational complexity, better interpretability, and comparable performance to the state-of-the-art results, the proposed approach can be employed in clinical and cardiac health screening applications. It also has the potential to be employed in remote monitoring with mobile and wearable devices because it is built on features extracted from only lead I and II ECG recordings.

AB  - With an increasing trend of women and elderly people living and travelling alone, their safety has become a matter of utmost importance. In this paper, we propose a novel and innovative Internet of Things (IoT) based solution in the form of a “smart safety band”. The extremely lightweight and mobile smart band is disguised as an innocuous fitness band. Various sensors interface with a microcontroller that transmits data to the web server directly. It can detect falls and sudden attacks manifesting as a spike in heart rate. If the user does not cancel in 30 seconds, a notification with user details, location and type of emergency is sent to emergency services and trusted contacts. The system can function even if the band has been destroyed after sending the first alert. Automation ensures that even if the user is incapacitated, the band automatically signals the server without requiring any user input.

AB  - Medicine has been chiefly a reactionary profession throughout history. Even today, one has to wait until diseases have manifested before attempting to treat or cure them. And because the genetic and environmental components that contribute to major diseases like Cancer, Alzheimer’s and cardiovascular diseases are not fully understandable, our efforts to treat them are often haphazard, unpredictable, and inefficient. As a result, the drugs and therapies developed are evaluated on large groups of people and given based on statical averages. And because of the genetic variances, they function for some patients but not for others. Every prescription medicine now on the market only works for half of the people who take it. Based on each patient’s unique genetic composition and environment circumstances, personalized medicine is a critical milestone to be attained to address this issue. Artificial intelligence and blockchain have recently been innovations in the healthcare industry. Furthermore, blockchain can control patient data privacy among participants. It uses asymmetric cryptography to secure transactions between users without the need for any intermediary or a trusted third party, thanks to smart contracts. On the other hand, Artificial intelligence provides intellect and decision-making capabilities for robots similar to humans. This study also identifies and analyses open research problems associated with blockchain and artificial intelligence in personalized medicine.

AB  - The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has revolutionised healthcare by allowing for remote monitoring and diagnosis of patients through medical devices. Medical image classification is essential for IoMT applications, as it enables early detection of diseases and personalised treatments. However, single-phase classification models face challenges distinguishing between similar conditions and differentiating them from normal cases. To address these challenges, this research proposes a Machine Learning-based Multi-Phase Medical Image Classification (ML-MPMIC) model that combines image segmentation and classification techniques to achieve higher accuracy in disease diagnosis. The proposed model is evaluated through simulation analysis and parameter optimisation. The proposed ML-MPMIC approach has high accuracy, precision, F score, and Low Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values and its potential to improve healthcare outcomes in IoMT applications

AB  - Cardiovascular rehabilitation is essential for illness prevention and management. A unique method for cardiovascular rehabilitation uses cloud computing and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to dynamically create personalized workout regimens. Traditional rehabilitation plans lack flexibility and are less successful. The suggested system analyses real-time physiological data and adapts workout regimens in the cloud using RNNs. Heart rate, blood pressure, and physical activity are monitored using wearable sensors. These gadgets smoothly send data to the cloud, where a powerful RNN model processes it. The RNN adapts workout suggestions to the user’s physiological reactions, historical data, and health objectives. The cloud-based system, which effectively processes sizable datasets and accommodates expanding user bases, ensures scalability. Remote access to rehabilitation services allows healthcare practitioners to monitor patients and alter workout routines remotely. The personalized approach tailors therapies to each person’s health profile to promote adherence and rehabilitation results. The suggested dynamic cardiovascular rehabilitation system uses cloud computing and powerful machine learning to build adaptive, personalized workout regimens, revolutionizing rehabilitation. This technique may improve cardiovascular rehabilitation plans, improving long-term health outcomes for at-risk or recovering cardiovascular disease patients.

AB  - The past decade has seen substantial growth in the prevalence and capabilities of wearable devices. For instance, recent human activity recognition (HAR) research has explored using wearable devices in applications such as remote monitoring of patients, detection of gait abnormalities, and cognitive disease identification. However, data collection poses a major challenge in developing HAR systems, especially because of the need to store data at a central location. This raises privacy concerns and makes continuous data collection difficult and expensive due to the high cost of transferring data from a user’s wearable device to a central repository. Considering this, we explore the adoption of federated learning (FL) as a potential solution to address the privacy and cost issues associated with data collection in HAR. More specifically, we investigate the performance and behavioral differences between FL and deep learning (DL) HAR models, under various conditions relevant to real-world deployments. Namely, we explore the differences between the two types of models when (i) using data from different sensor placements, (ii) having access to users with data from heterogeneous sensor placements, (iii) considering bandwidth efficiency, and (iv) dealing with data with incorrect labels. Our results show that FL models suffer from a consistent performance deficit in comparison to their DL counterparts, but achieve these results with much better bandwidth efficiency. Furthermore, we observe that FL models exhibit very similar responses to those of DL models when exposed to data from heterogeneous sensor placements. Finally, we show that the FL models are more robust to data with incorrect labels than their centralized DL counterparts.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is capable of controlling the healthcare monitoring system for remote-based patients. Epilepsy, a chronic brain syndrome characterized by recurrent, unpredictable attacks, affects individuals of all ages. IoT-based seizure monitoring can greatly enhance seizure patients' quality of life. IoT device acquires patient data and transmits it to a computer program so that doctors can examine it. Currently, doctors invest significant manual effort in inspecting Electroencephalograph (EEG) signals to identify seizure activity. However, EEG-based seizure detection algorithms face challenges in real-world scenarios due to non-stationary EEG data and variable seizure patterns among patients and recording sessions. Therefore, a sophisticated computer-based approach is necessary to analyze complex EEG records. In this work, the authors proposed a hybrid approach by combining traditional convolution neural (CN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) along with an attention mechanism for the automatic recognition of epileptic seizures through EEG signal analysis. This attention mechanism focuses on significant subsets of EEG data for class recognition, resulting in improved model performance. The proposed methods are evaluated using a publicly available UCI epileptic seizure recognition dataset, which consists of five classes: four normal conditions and one abnormal seizure condition. Experimental results demonstrate that the suggested approach achieves an overall accuracy of 97.05% for the five-class EEG recognition data, with an accuracy of 99.52% for binary classification distinguishing seizure cases from normal instances. Furthermore, the proposed intelligent seizure recognition model is compatible with an IoMT (Internet of Medical Things) cloud-based smart healthcare framework.

AB  - People suffering from chronic diseases require continuous support in monitoring their nutrition, diagnostic tests, medication, and daily activity tracking. Given the low ratio of patients to healthcare providers, it becomes infeasible to provide one-to-one support to patients. Furthermore the existing online medical consultation platforms are costly for regular approach. Addressing these issues, we propose to monitor and assist patients suffering from chronic disease using a novel Al-based and IoT-supported digital twin platform. A digital twin of a patient grows with the patient, and it helps in continuous and remote patient monitoring. Further, the digital twin enables the creation of patient-specific personalized treatment models, enabling doctors to conduct virtual simulations of the suitability of certain drugs and procedures. The data collected from the digital twin is fed to machine learning models for intelligent analysis, feedback, and support. The proposed solution incorporates five essential machine learning models using novel algorithms for drug recommendation, chronic disease stage detection, nutrition tracking and recommendation, patient activity tracking, and patient data anonymization. Addressing patients' lack of motivation to participate in emerging patient monitoring frameworks, we incorporate an incentive mechanism rooted in Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to encourage active participation in patients, which also has the added benefit of helping patients to store their historical medical data securely.

AB  - In recent years, there has been a surge in IoT healthcare applications, ranging from wearable health monitors and remote patient monitoring systems to smart medical devices, telemedicine platforms, and personalized health tracking and management tools. The purpose of these applications is to improve treatment outcomes, streamline healthcare delivery, and enable data-driven decision-making. However, due to the sensitive nature of health data and the critical role that these applications play in people’s lives, ensuring their security and privacy has become a paramount concern. To address this issue, we developed an explainable malicious traffic detection and monitoring system based on Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models. The proposed system involves the use of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods such as LIME, SHAP, ELI5, and Integrated Gradients(IG) to ensure the interpretability and explainability of the developed models. Finally, we demonstrate the high accuracy of the developed models in detecting attacks on the intensive care patient dataset. Furthermore, we ensure the transparency and interpretability of the model outcomes by presenting them through the Shapash Monitor interface, which can be easily accessed by both experts and non-experts.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease affecting millions worldwide. Bespoke subject-specific treatment (medication or deep brain stimulation (DBS)) is critical for management, yet depends on precise assessment cardinal PD symptoms - bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor. Clinician diagnosis is the basis of treatment, yet it allows only a cross-sectional assessment of symptoms which can vary on an hourly basis and is liable to inter- and intra-rater subjectivity across human examiners. Automated symptomatic assessment has attracted significant interest to optimise treatment regimens between clinician visits, however, no wearable has the capacity to simultaneously assess all three cardinal symptoms. Challenges in the measurement of rigidity, mapping muscle activity out-of-clinic and sensor fusion have inhibited translation. In this study, we address all through a novel wearable sensor system and machine learning algorithms. The sensor system is composed of a force-sensor, three inertial measurement units (IMUs) and four custom mechanomyography (MMG) sensors. The system was tested in its capacity to predict Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores based on quantitative assessment of bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor in PD patients. 23 PD patients were tested with the sensor system in parallel with exams conducted by treating clinicians and 10 healthy subjects were recruited as a comparison control group. Results prove the system accurately predicts UPDRS scores for all symptoms (85.4% match on average with physician assessment) and discriminates between healthy subjects and PD patients (96.6% on average). MMG features can also be used for remote monitoring of severity and fluctuations in PD symptoms out-of-clinic. This closed-loop feedback system enables individually tailored and regularly updated treatment, facilitating better outcomes for a very large patient population.

AB  - Human-Object Interaction (HOI) recognition, due to its significance in many computer vision-based applications, requires in-depth and meaningful details from image sequences. Incorporating semantics in scene understanding has led to a deep understanding of human-centric actions. Therefore, in this research work, we propose a semantic HOI recognition system based on multi-vision sensors. In the proposed system, the de-noised RGB and depth images, via Bilateral Filtering (BLF), are segmented into multiple clusters using a Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) algorithm. The skeleton is then extracted from segmented RGB and depth images via Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT). Human joints, extracted from the skeleton, provide the annotations for accurate pixel-level labeling. An elliptical human model is then generated via a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). A Conditional Random Field (CRF) model is trained to allocate a specific label to each pixel of different human body parts and an interaction object. Two semantic feature types that are extracted from each labeled body part of the human and labelled objects are: Fiducial points and 3D point cloud. Features descriptors are quantized using Fisher's Linear Discriminant Analysis (FLDA) and classified using K-ary Tree Hashing (KATH). In experimentation phase the recognition accuracy achieved with the Sports dataset is 92.88%, with the Sun Yat-Sen University (SYSU) 3D HOI dataset is 93.5% and with the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) RGB+D dataset it is 94.16%. The proposed system is validated via extensive experimentation and should be applicable to many computer-vision based applications such as healthcare monitoring, security systems and assisted living etc.

AB  - Recent advances in Internet-of-Things technology have opened the doors to new scenarios for biosensor applications. Flexibility, portability, and remote control and access are of utmost importance to move these devices to people’s homes or in a Point-of-Care context and rapidly share the results with users and their physicians. In this paper, an innovative portable device for both quantitative and semi-quantitative electrochemical analysis is presented. This device can operate autonomously without the need of relying on other devices (e.g., PC, tablets, or smartphones) thanks to built-in Wi-Fi connectivity. The developed hardware is integrated into a cloud-based platform, exploiting the cloud computational power to perform innovative algorithms for calibration (e.g., Machine Learning tools). Results and configurations can be accessed through a web page without the installation of dedicated APPs or software. The electrical input/output characteristic was measured with a dummy cell as a load, achieving excellent linearity. Furthermore, the device response to five different concentrations of potassium ferri/ferrocyanide redox probe was compared with a bench-top laboratory instrument. No difference in analytical sensitivity was found. Also, some examples of application-specific tests were set up to demonstrate the use in real-case scenarios. In addition, Support Vector Machine algorithm was applied to semi-quantitative analyses to classify the input samples into four classes, achieving an average accuracy of 98.23%. Finally, COVID-19 related tests are presented and discussed.

AB  - Considering the increasing growth of communicable diseases worldwide such as COVID-19, it is recommended to stay at home for patients with fewer chronic health problems. In recent times, the high chance of COVID-19 spread and the lack of an excellent remote monitoring system make the situation challenging for hospital administrators. Inspired by these challenges, in this paper, we develop a new edge-centric healthcare framework for remote health monitoring and disease prediction using Wearable Sensors (WSs) and advanced Machine Learning (ML) model, namely Bag-of-Neural Network (BoNN), respectively. The epidemic model collects the health symptoms of the patient using various a set of WSs and preprocesses the data in distributed edge devices for preparing a useful dataset. Finally, the proposed BoNN model is applied over the refined dataset for detecting COVID-19 disease at centralized cloud servers using a set of random neural networks. To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed BoNN model over the standard ML models, the system is fine-tuned and trained over a synthetic COVID-19 dataset before being evaluated on a benchmark Brazil COVID-19 dataset using various performance metrics. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed BoNN model achieves 99.8% accuracy while analyzing the Brazil dataset.

AB  - The development and adoption of Electronic Health Records and health monitoring Internet of Things (IoT) devices have enabled the digitization of patient records. They have also substantially transformed the healthcare delivery system in remote patient monitoring, healthcare decision-making, and medical research. However, data tends to be fragmented among health information systems, preventing interoperability of medical data at the point of care. In order to address this gap, we propose and implement a novel architecture that utilizes blockchain and IoT technologies for integrating personal health data. The architecture comprises of two components: (1) BlockIoT contains a suite of smart contracts that define data collection and integration functionalities, and (2) RETEL utilizes a novel smart contract deployment and execution architecture. The BlockIoT-RETEL architecture combines these two components to provide a scalable mechanism for bootstrapping a personal health data collection infrastructure in the context of healthcare. We have compared the key functionalities of our system with existing comparable state-of-the-art systems in healthcare and evaluated the performance in prototypical healthcare settings with simulated data that shows promising results.

AB  - Wrist-worn wearable devices have become increasingly prevalent in monitoring human activities, with applications ranging from healthcare to fitness tracking. Accurate human activity recognition from wrist-worn sensor data is essential for enabling these applications. However, the high-dimensional nature of sensor data poses challenges in terms of computational complexity and model interpretability. Feature selection is a critical step in mitigating these challenges by identifying a subset of relevant features while preserving the discriminative information. In this study, we propose a complexity-aware feature selection method tailored for wearable systems. Our approach leverages the intrinsic characteristics of the data to prioritize and select the most informative features while simultaneously weighing their computational efficiency by means of an ad-hoc metric that quantifies the number of significant CPU instructions associated with each feature. The results on publicly available datasets demonstrate that the proposed method effectively balances computational complexity and recognition accuracy.

AB  - As the world’s population ages, there will be a greater need for creative methods to help the elderly maintain their independence and quality of life at home. This study investigates the feasibility of using healthcare bots powered by cloud-based Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) to provide elderly people with individualized and timely support. The proposed system learns from each user’s interactions and improves over time to better meet their specific requirements. Also, the cloud-based design ensures real-time updates and smooth interaction with different devices. Results show that the system is effective in improving the quality of geriatric support, promoting aging in place, and contributing to the creation of patient-centric healthcare solutions via a thorough review that includes user input and performance indicators. The results point to a potential direction for integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and healthcare to meet the issues of an aging population.

This paper presents an IoT-based health monitoring system for the elderly that utilizes sensors to collect vital signs and sends data to a central server for analysis and reporting. The proposed system aims to provide continuous, real-time monitoring of elderly patients and timely intervention when necessary. Our aim is to design a smart hearing aid which takes care of the complexity of the technology and eases it for old people. In this project, we sought to discover a means of assisting the elderly by automating some of their routine tasks and facilitating their interaction with technology. Our suggested methodology has demonstrated how this can be accomplished and put into practice using an Arduino Uno and AI assistant. This project will be very useful for the people who are technologically backward as well as physically disabled people. Hearing aids can help the persons with the loss in sensorineural.

AB  - In a nutshell, the IoT refers to the idea of integrating high-tech technology in the form of "smart" gadgets and sensors into a single setting to gather data. There are still numerous areas in which machines cannot compete favorably with people, but data collection and analysis are undeniably two of their strongest points. The Internet of Things makes it possible to fully or partially automation data, it involves related activities, which is obviously very important for the healthcare industry. What exactly is the Internet connected medical things, and how exactly might it make a significant impact on the sector? By having to apply the concept of the internet of things (IoT) to the field of medicine, several significant advancements have become possible, including the ability to automatically control the thermostat of containers while transmitting inoculations and antibiotics, the accurate tracking of the ailments of a lot of illnesses without a need for additional meetings with a general practitioner, the correct and most useful use of meds, and a great deal more. All of this is realizable because of the capability of MedTech gadgets to carry out continuous monitoring system. The potential applications of internet of things technology in healthcare are very interesting. Let’s review the ways in which this technology.

AB  - Innovations in health monitoring systems are fundamental for the continuous improvement of remote healthcare. With the current presence of SARS-CoV-2, better known as COVID-19, in people’s daily lives, solutions for monitoring heart and especially respiration and pulmonary functions are more needed than ever. In this paper, we survey the current approaches that utilize the advantages of sensor technologies to sense, analyze, and estimate health data related to respiration, heart, and sleep monitoring. We focus on illustrating the signal processing and machine learning techniques used on each approach to facilitate researchers’ understanding of how data is processed nowadays. We have classified the reviewed papers into two main categories: contact and contactless sensors. In each category, we discuss the different types of used sensors, the data analysis technique, and the accuracy of those techniques.
