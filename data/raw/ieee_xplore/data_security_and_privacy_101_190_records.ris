AB  - Remote patient monitoring aspect of Healthcare 4.0 has revolutionized the way we pursue medical treatment. Integration of Medical Internet of Things (MIoT), patient centric healthcare devices and remote robotic equipment has vanished the separative line between physical onsite monitoring and remote monitoring. Secure use of available network to handle this critical patient data is one of the major concern raised due to this methodology. To mitigate this paramount concern Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can be utilized to detect in malicious activity or manipulation occurred on incoming data. Though use of ML algorithms along with conventional feature extraction technique brings performance saturation challenge and creates a black-box in this highly complex communication environment. To overcome this drawback, we propose X-NET, an eXplainable Artificial Intelligent (X-AI) based network data security approach for Healthcare 4.0 applications. For comparison purpose we have used five different types of tradition feature extraction techniques along with Naive Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (LR) and Perception. Utilization of X-AI algorithms such as LIME and SHAP has significantly boosted the overall performance and reliability of X-NET. Performance evolution of our proposed approach has been done through various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, Receiver Operating Characteristic and Precision-Recall Trade-off. Thus, X-NET contributes in defining secured, reliable and robust remote patient monitoring scheme for Healthcare 4.0.

AB  - People's inherent ability tends to deteriorate as they get older, and their health problems get more complicated and chronic. As people get older, multimorbidity—the simultaneous occurrence of many chronic conditions becomes more common. Health systems around the world struggle to adapt to the great range of physical and mental abilities of older people and to encourage good trajectories of healthy aging from an early age. The abilities of an older person can change quickly—in some circumstances, over the course of hours. Care systems struggle to adapt rapidly enough to meet a person's changing demands. As a result of the impending lack of healthcare workers qualified to provide for senior citizens, adopting elder-friendly technologies may level the playing field in the industry. A decision support system can send alerts to elderly people, their family members, and carers, recommending the necessary interventions to halt further health deterioration, based on the statistically significant changes that can be found in daily records using a combination of modern data mining techniques. This study examines the most recent Internet of Things (IoT) technology can assist carers in improving the health, safety, and quality of life of independent elderly persons. The system is based on the behavior of senior citizens at home.

AB  - According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 15 million infants are born prematurely each year. In the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), the critical health parameters of newborn babies must be monitored precisely and in real time. Approximately one million preterm babies suffer morbidity before the age of five due to preterm birth and complications associated with preterm delivery. The neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) requires accurate, real-time monitoring of newborn infants' vital health parameters. One of the challenges encountered by the majority of hospitals is the lack of systems that can track real-time health parameters and notify doctors and parents to indicate any neonatal critical conditions. This research article presents a framework that incorporates IoT, fog, deep learning technologies, Blockchain, and decentralized cloud for NICU newborn health monitoring. The development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain technologies provides wide opportunities for enhancing the data management of neonatal intensive care units. By integrating IoT devices comprising wearable sensors and smart monitors the system gets real-time data on vital signs like heart rate, temperature, blood oxygen levels, and breathing rate. Fog computing is used for the instantaneous analysis of critical data, and an efficient deep learning algorithm will be implemented at the fog layer to classify data into either critical or non-critical data. Since fog has limited resources, a private blockchain is used to store critical data. The critical data is stored temporarily on a private blockchain and permanently on a decentralized cloud.

AB  - The Internet of Medical Things (IoMTs) are critical components in wearable healthcare applications such as bio-systems, rehabilitation robots, activity identification, to name a few. Traditional security measures are unable to protect data from harmful attackers. Patients' privacy may be endangered as a result of eavesdropping, and the diagnosis of life-threatening diseases may be delayed as a result of IoMT device malfunction caused by attacks such as Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Blockchain has emerged as a possible answer to these problems. The benefits of adopting blockchain based into the healthcare ecosystem include decentralisation, dependability, efficiency, security, and privacy, to name a few. Biometric systems have been rapidly gaining traction in a variety of industries in recent years, and they continue to provide enhanced security for access control systems. In comparison to traditional procedures, security methods based on biometric features give more trustworthiness while requiring less processing. As a result, biometric traits are used in current healthcare systems to implement security in healthcare. This research work proposes a secure blockchain based architecture for IoMT based healthcare applications that can provide decentralized and secure communication while taking into account the constraints listed above. Bio-keys, in combination with biometric authentication are also offered as a way to further enhance the security.

AB  - The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), which integrates medical sensors with the Internet of Things, is helpful for providing remote diagnosis and real-time decision making. Massive data collected by medical and healthcare monitoring sensors in the IoMT involves sensitive patient information. It brings some security challenges to validate the legitimacy of participating entities and protect patient data privacy. A certificateless signcryption (CLSC) scheme combines encryption and signature that can offer authenticity, confidentiality, and unforgeability, providing a viable solution to the data privacy issue of the IoMT. However, existing CLSC schemes fail to meet confidentiality or unforgeability, or require expensive computation overhead to perform pairing operations. This article first presents a new CLSC scheme for secure data transmission and better smart services in IoMT, which replaces the signature part with the Schnorr signature. We then give a thorough security proof under the random oracle model. Besides, we elaborately evaluate the performance and security of some existing solutions with our solution. Finally, the experiment results indicate that our solution can achieve a better balance between security and performance than some existing schemes. Therefore, in terms of feasibility, our scheme is more suitable for the IoMT scenario.

AB  - Advanced analytics are becoming more important in telehealth environments as the number of connected devices continues to rise, necessitating the collection of massive amounts of time-series patient data. This system uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks in telemedicine that are linked to the Internet of Things (IoT), with an emphasis on accurate longitudinal monitoring of patient behavior. An extensive dataset gathered from IoT devices that track several health metrics in real-time is used in the research. LSTM networks are used to detect patterns and relationships in time-series data using a deep learning technique. In turn, this allows the system to analyze patient behavior with more precision and speed. IoT provides seamless connections for real-time data transfer it offers continuous monitoring within the telehealth framework. The LSTM-based model improves our comprehension of patient behavior, which in turn enables us to spot outliers, forecast health trends, and provide individualized healthcare recommendations. Through its demonstration of LSTM networks' usefulness in the context of IoT-connected telehealth settings, the study makes a valuable contribution to the rapidly growing area of digital health. Accurate time-series analysis has the ability to improve patient monitoring, early intervention, and healthcare outcomes, as shown by the results.

AB  - Most people are unable to identify their actual illness, and many patients die before they are hospitalized. Therefore, in this research, a health monitoring system (HMS) is proposed and it suggests diseases such as arrhythmia, diabetes, fever, etc. and diagnoses chronic diseases in the ambulance itself and provides real-time prediction for critical and normal patients. The proposed system has a multi-tiered structure where physiological features are captured by wearable medical sensors (WMS) and machine learning suites are used to analyze data and to detect chronic diseases. Results obtained on the real datasets puts forward that sensor data and machine learning can effectively predict chronic diseases in real time. HMS can predict accuracies of various conditions such as arrhythmia (98.89%). Diabetes (96.74%), hypertension (98.85%), fever (99.85%) and thyroid (97.4%). In conclusion, we can say that the proposed HMS can assist us to monitor the affected person's physical condition at his/her residence, or at the ambulance within the golden hour of a patient's life.

AB  - Blockchain, cryptographically linked blocks of data, is the key technology behind the infamous cryptocurrency Bitcoin, however, blockchain can serve more use cases than just cryptocurrency. The technology has use cases in any industry that generates and transfers data. In a use case such as cryptocurrency the blockchain is used to manage transactions from peer-to-peer in a way that does not allow for that transaction's data to be manipulated by one of the involved parties or a third party. This is a valuable process that other industries could leverage. One such industry that could benefit from applying blockchain technology for a multitude of cases is the healthcare industry. Primary care doctors could be connected to a blockchain system that allowed them to access patient data and securely monitor the respective patient, pharmaceutical companies could increase their products validity in the marketplace with individual product tracking, and the insurance industry could trust all the information about a client. All of these are possible use cases for blockchain in the healthcare industry. Currently, the healthcare industry is not leveraging the blockchain at scale. Within this paper we are going to explore the possibilities for blockchain technology and the use cases in the healthcare industry specifically, and how the different industries within the healthcare industry can implement a blockchain system.

AB  - Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are recognized for their intelligence as they seamlessly interact with humans, enhancing the physical world through computation, communication, and control. Over the last few years, the evolution of CPS, including IoT components, has significantly impacted many facets of people’s lifestyles. It has been immersed in a wide range of services and applications in various areas, including manufacturing, healthcare, and energy. However, the interrelationship between the cyber and physical worlds gives rise to a multitude of research problems and challenges. In the healthcare field, for instance, CPS introduces complexities related to interoperability, privacy, data security, and real-time data processing with critical implications for the reliability and safety of medical processes. To address these challenges and harness the full potential of CPS in healthcare, this paper, through a comprehensive literature review, aims to discuss cutting-edge CPS technologies and solutions that hold promise for healthcare applications. To this end, we propose a comprehensive architectural model that can serve as a benchmark for implementing CPS in healthcare applications. This model thoroughly details how services, components, and technologies can be integrated to transform massive raw data collected from the physical world into valuable information for an enhanced decision-making process. Finally, a use case on healthcare CPS is presented, outlining its characteristics, the role that different technologies have played in its development, and the major challenges in implementing such systems successfully. This study provides a cohesive understanding of the role CPS can play in empowering healthcare while offering insights into the challenges, and future research trends.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is a rapidly growing network of interconnected devices, ranging from sensors and actuators to smart appliances and wearable devices. The proliferation of these connected devices generates vast amounts of data and enables a broad range of applications and services, adding to the complexity of IoT development systems. To address this complexity, careful consideration of design patterns and modeling techniques are necessary to ensure that IoT systems are scalable, flexible, and maintainable. In the healthcare industry, IoT-based systems is being developed to improve patient care and outcomes while also managing costs. However, these systems pose significant challenges because IoT-based monitoring of health parameters demands meticulous attention to detail. Even slight inaccuracies in the collected data could have severe consequences for patient diagnosis and treatment. Additionally, any system failures or disruptions could delay crucial interventions and significantly impact patient outcomes. Consequently, it is imperative to carefully consider the design and implementation of IoT-based healthcare systems to guarantee accurate data collection and timely interventions. In this paper, we present the approach involved in developing IoT-based smart health monitoring systems to collect and analyze patient data related to their health and wellbeing. The focus of this research is to identify and model the best practices for developing scalable and flexible IoT-based healthcare systems that address the challenges of remote patient monitoring, including the need for continuous monitoring, real-time feedback, and early detection of health issues.

AB  - Several healthcare applications have been launched in recent years to enhance the healthcare sector. The emergence of miniature medical sensors to track patients’ vital signs has strengthened and enhanced the human healthcare system. The objective of this initiative is to improve healthcare security by integrating IoT and blockchain technology to preserve patient data and enable remote vital sign monitoring. Vital sign monitoring has been greatly enhanced by the widespread use of tiny medical sensors, which have increased data availability for early diagnosis and therapy recommendations. Nonetheless, there are issues with guaranteeing data security and privacy with the current technologies. Blockchain technology is included in the suggested solution because of its special qualities, which include transparency and data privacy. IoT sensors are used to gather patient data, like temperature, heart rate, and oxygen saturation levels, which are then safely sent via Postman API to a private permissioned blockchain. With a key size of 256 bits, the data is encrypted using SHA 256, creating public and private keys for further protection. Specialist physicians are able to read documents pertinent to their areas of expertise since access restriction is applied through private channels. In order to guarantee a strong and safe healthcare environment, the research also incorporates an easy-to-use interface for hospital managers to manage appointments, ambulance reservations, and get notifications when vital indicators surpass threshold levels.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) and software applications have radically improved healthcare, especially in terms of detecting and reporting adverse events that compromise patient safety. With the prompt detection and reporting of adverse occurrences, this literature review seeks to give a thorough understanding of the origin, applications, benefits, and challenges of IoT and software solutions in improving patient safety. A thorough literature search was undertaken in six scholarly databases including, PubMed, IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Google Scholar, to identify articles related to IoT and software applications for detecting and reporting patient safety adverse events (AEs). Seventy-four pertinent publications were found and included after a thorough search of the peer-reviewed literature. To gain an understanding of the design components, the history of IoT applications, and the wide range of application domains in patient safety adverse event detection and reporting, these publications underwent critical analysis. The review identified a promising path for timely and precise adverse event identification through the combined efforts of IoT technology, including wearables, sensors, and real-time monitoring systems, with sophisticated software applications for the administration of medications, detection, and prevention of falls, and remote patient monitoring, all of which improved patient safety. Despite the promising prospects of IoT technologies, problems with data privacy, security, and scalability were identified as challenges to their successful integration into health systems' safety. The critical importance of IoT and software technologies in modernizing patient safety adverse event detection and reporting is highlighted by this study. This calls for improved knowledge in integrating IoT technological solutions into safe healthcare practices through collaborative research, and interventional studies to assess the impact it has on health outcomes of hospitalized patients.

AB  - Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is becoming an essential part of remote health monitoring due to the evolution of medical wireless sensors and intelligent communication technologies. IoT-based healthcare applications are employed in the medical centers to provide continuous health monitoring of a patient. However, recent smart medical devices have limited resources to handle the huge amount of healthcare data. IoMT faces several challenging issues, like security, privacy, anonymity, and interoperability. In data aggregation and communication, the privacy and security of medical information is a demanding task. Therefore, we proposed a suitable scheme to overcome the limitations of existing research studies. This paper presents an Efficient and Secure Data Transmission and Aggregation (ESDTA) scheme to enhance aggregation efficiency and data security. Our proposed work provides secure data aggregation and data forwarding of healthcare parameter values by employing the Secure Message Aggregation (SMA) algorithm and Secure Message Decryption (SMD) algorithm at the Mobile Node (MN) and Fog Node (FN), respectively. From a security perspective, the proposed scheme preserves the data integrity and also protect against several security threats like data fabrication and replay attack. The proposed scenario is simulated through simulation tool NS 2.35. The simulation results prove that aggregation at the MN effectively reduces transmission and communication costs. Furthermore, the effective computation at the FN minimizes the storage and computational cost at the cloud server. Thus, the analysis of the proposed scheme shows the supremacy of our proposed work. We compare our scheme with other related secure data aggregation-based schemes in terms of communication cost, energy consumption, resilience, storage and computational cost.

AB  - Medical Internet of Things (MIoT) is a rapidly growing field that promises to revolutionize health care. The ability to connect devices and collect data from them has the potential to transform the way it monitors and treat patients. However, the security and privacy of this data is a major concern. The cryptography and other conventional methods for security in resource constrained MIoT has several shortcomings. First, it does not provide adequate protection for patient data. Second, it is not designed to work with the large number of devices and huge volumes of data that are typically generated in MIoT applications. In this article, secure M-Trust privacy protocol (SMP) has been designed to address these issues. The SMP protocol uses a combination of trust, cryptographic, and machine learning techniques to provide security and privacy for data in transit. The SMP protocol has been designed to work with the smart health care monitoring system to provide a secure and private communication channel between devices in the system. The SMP protocol is an improvement over the existing security and privacy protocols for medical data. The simulation results proves that the SMP protocol is more efficient and scalable than the existing protocols. The SMP protocol is a valuable addition to the MIoT landscape and can help improve the privacy of data exchanged between medical devices.

AB  - The Medical Internet of Things (MIoT) facilitates extensive connections between cyber and physical “things” allowing for effective data fusion and remote patient diagnosis and monitoring. However, there is a risk of incorrect diagnosis when data is tampered with from the cloud or a hospital due to third-party storage services. Most of the existing systems use an owner-centric data integrity verification mechanism, which is not computationally feasible for lightweight wearable-sensor systems because of limited computing capacity and privacy leakage issues. In this regard, we design a 2-step Privacy-Preserving Multidimensional Data Stream (PPMDS) approach based on a cloudlet framework with an Uncertain Data-integrity Optimization (UDO) model and Sparse-Centric SVM (SCS) model. The UDO model enhances health data security with an adaptive cryptosystem called Cloudlet- Nonsquare Encryption Secret Transmission (C-NEST) strategy by avoiding medical disputes during data streaming based on novel signature and key generation strategies. The SCS model effectively classifies incoming queries for easy access to data by solving scalability issues. The cloudlet server measures data integrity and authentication factors to optimize third-party verification burden and computational cost. The simulation outcomes show that the proposed system optimizes average data leakage error rate by 27%, query response time and average data transmission time are reduced by 31%, and average communication-computation cost are reduced by 61% when measured against state-of-the-art approaches.

AB  - Over the past decade, focus on the security and privacy aspects of implantable medical devices (IMDs) has intensified, driven by the multitude of cybersecurity vulnerabilities found in various existing devices. However, due to their strict computational, energy and physical constraints, conventional security protocols are not directly applicable to IMDs. Custom-tailored schemes have been proposed instead which, however, fail to cover the full spectrum of security features that modern IMDs and their ecosystems so critically require. In this paper we propose IMDfence, a security protocol for IMD ecosystems that provides a comprehensive yet practical security portfolio, which includes availability, non-repudiation, access control, entity authentication, remote monitoring and system scalability. The protocol also allows emergency access that results in the graceful degradation of offered services without compromising security and patient safety. The performance of the security protocol as well as its feasibility and impact on modern IMDs are extensively analyzed and evaluated. We find that IMDfence achieves the above security requirements at a mere less than 7% increase in total IMD energy consumption, and less than 14 ms and 9 kB increase in system delay and memory footprint, respectively.

AB  - On account of privacy preserving issue and health-care monitoring, physiological signal biometric authentication system has gained popularity in recent years. Seismocardiogram (SCG) is now easily accessible owing to the advance of wearable sensor technology. However, SCG biometric has not been widely explored due to the challenging motion artifact removal. In this paper, we design placing the sensors at different body parts under different activities to determine the best sensor location. In addition, we develop SCG noise removal algorithm and utilize machine learning approach to perform biometric authentication tasks. We validate the proposed methods on 20 healthy young adults. The dataset contains acceleration data of sitting, standing, walking, and sitting post-exercise activities with the sensor placed at the wrists, neck, heart and sternum. We demonstrate that vertical and dorsal-ventral SCG near the heart and the sternum produce reliable SCG biometric evidenced by achieving the state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, we present the efficacy of the devised noise removal procedure in the authentication during walking motion.Clinical relevance— A seismocardiography-based biometric authentication system can help serve privacy preserving and reveal cardiovascular functioning information in clinics.

AB  - Today, Wireless medium-based communication carries lots of benefits to human life with various aspects like telecommunication, medical facilities, military, and many more. If communication is secure, then the impact of communication in the area of wireless communication becomes prior, but the security concern is a major concern in this era. Ensuring the security of Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN s) is paramount, especially in the context of remote health monitoring. To address this concern, we introduce a novel WBAN-based Secure Remote Location-Based Healthcare Monitoring (SRL-HM) System aimed at monitoring human health remotely. While various security mechanisms exist, cryptography emerges as a robust choice. In our research, we propose an Elliptical Curve Cryptography (ECC) based routing protocol within WBAN, termed Secure Distributed and Energy Efficient Routing (SDEER). This protocol integrates the Feed Forward with Back Propagation Neural Network (F2-BPNN) concept alongside the metaheuristics Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. Our goal is to mitigate security vulnerabilities while also addressing energy constraints inherent in WBANs. Here, we proposed a model using the combination of bio-sensor nodes and communication sensor nodes. A combination of ECC as an encryption approach and SDEER is beneficial footsteps for the distribution of traffic load in the entire network which minimizes the security as well as the energy consumption by selecting the most trusted sensor nodes in the route for the data transmission via trusted authority.

AB  - The most burning topic of today, calls for a holistic solution that is reliable, secure, privacy preserved, cost effective Cloud storage that can tide over the turbulent conditions of the rapidly budding digital storage technologies. This send an outcry for a devoted solution, in the form of an individualized, patient-centric care - IoMT that augments precise disease identifications, decrease in errors, reduction in costs of care through the support of technology, allows patients to direct health information data to doctors,manage drugs, keep Personal Health Records, caters to remote medical supports Care, provides proactive approach to preserving Good Health, improves and Accelerates Clinician Workflows, empowers extreme connectivity due to better automation and perceptions in the DNA of IoMT functions. But IoMT adoption is like a rose with thorns like constraints of increased administrative costs, deficiency of universal data access, present-day electronic medical records. The BCT is used in the framework to overcome the security issues of IoMT through the use of latest encryptions. Furthermore, this framework harnesses the benefits of Block Chain like reduced cost, speed, automation, immutability, near-impossible loss of data, permanence, removal of intermediaries, decentralization of consensus, legitimate access to health data, data safekeeping, accrual-based imbursement mechanisms, and medical supply chain efficacy.

The integrity of the Layered Architecture is validated with the already existing ones in terms of audit performances. The results from the Layered Architecture are validated and are proven to be competent in achieving safe auditing and surpass the former ones. The technology is in the sprouting phases, it is perilous that affiliates of the Health Care community realize the rudimentary ideas behind Block Chain, and detect its feasible impact on the future of patient centric medical care. Finally, and most importantly, this paper also gives a panoramic view on the current research status, and imminent directions of Secure Internet of Medical Things Using Block Chain.

AB  - About 1% of newborns have congenital heart disease at birth. This generally does not imply death, but it leads to multiple hospitalizations and outpatient visits. In addition, it results in a negative impact on quality of life for the children themselves and for their families. Telemedicine platforms can be employed in this field, to reduce the number of hospital admissions and check-ups and to improve the communication between parents/caregivers and the hospital staff. The aim of the AIR CARDIO project is to evaluate the impact, efficiency and effectiveness of a home telemonitoring system for children with congenital heart disease. The vital signs (i.e. ECG, heart rate, body temperature, body weight and oxygen saturation) are collected by some biomedical sensors and sent to a smart-hub. The smart-hub proceeds then to the synchronization with the e-Health care center, enabling the doctors to evaluate the patient’s parameters. Some questionnaires are also provided to parents/caregivers through the application, for the evaluation of the effects of the system on quality of life. In the clinical trial, which lasts 12 months, 45 patients are recruited from the U.O.C. Paediatric and Adult Congenital Cardiology - Monasterio Foundation. Preliminary results highlight suitability of the sensors selected for children and good usability of the smart-hub technology.

The concept of the framework is a breakthrough in the state of medical, scientific and technological art, aimed at engaging patients in the treatment plan and supporting interaction with healthcare professionals. The proposed platform is able to support a new paradigm for the management of patients with COPD, by integrating clinical data and parameters monitored in daily life using Artificial Intelligence algorithms. Therefore, the doctor is provided with a dynamic picture of the disease and its impact on lifestyle and vice versa, and can thus plan more personalized diagnostics, therapeutics, and social interventions. This strategy allows for a more effective organization of access to outpatient care and therefore a reduction of emergencies and hospitalizations because exacerbations of the disease can be better prevented and monitored. Hence, it can result in improvements in patients' quality of life and lower costs for the healthcare system.

AB  - Digital technologies, such as wireless body area networks (WBANs) for mobile health (mHealth) applications, are expected to enhance the quality of the public health care system. Although mHealth can improve patients' quality of health by offering outpatient real-time health monitoring systems instead of being stuck in the hospital all the time to monitor chronic diseases. The major challenge in adopting mHealth is data security and privacy. The health data routed on the internet from the patient monitoring device to the health center for remote monitoring is vulnerable to confidentiality attacks. To handle this issue, we present an authentication scheme based on non-interactive zero-knowledge proof (NIZKP), which issues certificates and authenticates monitoring devices each time performing transactions without revealing sensitive information. Our authentication scheme provides a high level of security with a low computational cost, which is lightweight for WBANs.

AB  - The current healthcare ecosystem often faces challenges such as data breaches, unauthorized access, data silos, and difficulties in tracking and verifying medical device supply chains. These issues pose a threat to patient confidentiality, trust in healthcare data, and the efficiency of healthcare operations. To address these challenges, a proposed model introduces a unique approach to bolstering the security and efficiency of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in healthcare through the use of advanced cryptographic techniques. Specifically, the model utilizes a heavy computation algorithm known as Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) for packet verification in IoT devices. In addition to ECC, the model incorporates Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) for verification, providing a lighter alternative to ECC. ZKP works by signing the input messages and subsequently verifying the data, offering a robust security measure. The implementation strategy involves simulating IoT sensors, each equipped with ECC and Zero Knowledge proof capabilities for enhanced security.

AB  - Implantable medical devices (IMD) such as pace-makers, and cardiac defibrillators are becoming increasingly interconnected to networks for remote patient monitoring. However, networked devices are vulnerable to external attacks that could allow adversaries to gain unauthorized access to devices/data and break patient privacy. To design a lightweight computational trustworthy of IMD, we propose novel ECG-based biometric authentication using lift and shift method based on post-processing data from the noise generated in an ECG signal recording. The lift and shift method is an ideal addition to this system because it is a quick, lightweight process that produces enough random bits for encrypted communication. ECG is a signal that is already being measured by the IMD, so this ECG biometric could utilize the data that is already being actively recorded. We provide a comprehensive evaluation across multiple NIST tests, as well as ENT and Dieharder statistical suites test.

AB  - With the rapid growth of edge-assisted solutions in Internet of Things (IoT) networks, connected healthcare progressively relies on such solutions. This refers to systems in which all the healthcare stakeholders are connected to each other. These systems employ novel technologies, such as IoT, edge computing, and artificial intelligence (AI) to convert conventional health systems to more effective, appropriate, and customized intelligent systems. However, such systems encounter many restrictions and require new policies. By moving the computation and processing closer to the data sources and end-users, fog becomes edge computing which can reduce latency, bandwidth usage, and energy consumption. To the best of our knowledge, there is no systematic and methodological research in this scope that investigates the existing studies considering various vital and relevant factors. Thus, this survey aims to examine the state-of-the-art research in this area. We have reviewed a significant number of papers in this area and divided them into two main taxonomies, patient-centric and process-centric techniques. Furthermore, essential factors, such as available data sets and parameters like accuracy, mobility, and data rates are described and examined. Our aim is to bridge the gap between edge computing and connected healthcare solutions by discussing the challenges and highlighting future trends.

AB  - There have already been initiatives to use the new technology in numerous areas to improve the standards of human existence as a result of technological advancement and sensor shrinking. The healthcare industry is one significant field of research where the concept has been adopted. Health services are extraordinarily expensive for the individuals who need them, and this is particularly true in developing nations. As a consequence, this research is an effort to address a contemporary healthcare issue in society. The creation of a remote healthcare system was the project’s principal goal. There are three primary components to it. The first step involved employing sensors for detecting the patient’s vital signs, the second involved transmitting the data to cloud storage, and the final step involved making the detected information available for enabling remote visuals. A doctor or caretaker can remotely access the data and track a patient’s health improvement from a location other than the hospital. The Internet of Things (IoT) principles have been widely applied to connect the available medical resources and provide patients with intelligent, dependable, and efficient healthcare. Among the ideas that can harness the benefits of the IoT to enhance the sufferer’s lifestyle is health monitoring for dynamic and supported living. We have provided an IoT system that has been specially designed for smart healthcare in this project. The proposal’s goal was to develop a Remote Health Monitoring System that could be created using readily accessible local sensors in order to keep costs low if it were to be mass produced. As a result, the presented architecture gathers sensor data using an Arduino microcontroller and transmits it to the cloud for processing and analysis before being made available for remote viewing. In the event of any emergencies, corrective actions depending on the evaluated data can be communicated back to the doctor or guardian by email and SMS notifications.

AB  - There is a global concern with the escalating number of patients at hospitals caused mainly by population aging, chronic diseases, and recently by the COVID-19 outbreak. To smooth this challenge, IoT emerges as an encouraging paradigm because it provides the scalability required for this purpose, supporting continuous and reliable health monitoring on a global scale. Based on this context, an IoT-based healthcare platform to provide remote monitoring for patients in a critical situation was proposed in the authors’ previous works. Therefore, this paper aims to extend the platform by integrating wearable and unobtrusive sensors to monitor patients with coronavirus disease. Furthermore, we report a real deployment of our approach in an intensive care unit for COVID-19 patients in Brazil.

AB  - With the continuous development of wearable devices and the Internet of Things, Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) consisting of wireless body area networks is booming. The IoMT system can play the role of continuous and remote monitoring of various medical parameters of patients, which provides a new direction for future medical diagnosis and can well increase the efficiency of medical services. However, the medical sensitive data collected during the communication process is vulnerable to various attacks when transmitted through wireless channels, which can easily induce to the leakage of patients’ privacy data and other security problems. In addition, owing to the limited computing resources of wearable devices, designing a secure authentication protocol is still a challenge that requires concerted efforts. In this paper, an improved lightweight anonymous authentication protocol is proposed, and the proposed scheme can guarantee the required security in IOMT system. It can be verified by the formal and informal security proofs presented in the paper. And the overall performance has been improved, including the improvement of security performance and the reduction of communication cost.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of remote patient monitoring, particularly for those suffering from chronic illnesses. Such individuals require continuous monitoring to ensure the stability of their condition and prevent complications. However, traditional methods of patient monitoring can be invasive, time-consuming, and often result in patients feeling limited in their daily activities. The development of intelligent monitoring systems based on Internet of Things technologies has the potential to revolutionize the way chronic illness is managed. These systems can be integrated with wearable/portable devices and other sensors to track vital signs in real-time. This information can then be transmitted to healthcare providers for review, allowing for early detection of any changes or potential issues. The benefits of such systems are numerous. They provide patients with increased freedom and mobility, as they no longer need to visit a healthcare facility for regular check-ups. They also reduce the workload for healthcare providers, freeing up time for more critical cases. Furthermore, they can result in cost savings for healthcare systems by reducing the need for hospitalization. This work introduces the SMART CARE project that aims to develop an integrated monitoring system consisting of hardware and software components that can make the various phases of managing a patient with chronic heart failure (prevention, diagnosis, therapy, follow-up) more efficient. The paper provides the main information on the project and presents and describes the system architecture of the proposed solution.

AB  - Telemedicine is becoming increasingly important in recent years, especially in chronic diseases treatment. Thanks to these platforms, it is possible to assist patients remotely, being continuously monitored according to personalized care plans as if they were at the hospital. The characteristics of telemedicine platforms resulted extremely useful when Covid-19 pandemic broke out. Intense monitoring of patients at home, social distancing, and resource rationalization provided great help to medical personnel and healthcare systems. This novel disease, however, has posed new challenges, given by the quicker evolution of a patient's clinical status with respect to chronic diseases. In particular, the updates of the care plan performed remotely by doctors need to be immediately delivered to monitoring kits located at the patient’s home, in order to adjust the monitoring plan of the target patient. Since this update is a critical operation, acknowledgment strategies are required to guarantee feedbacks upon delivery. Immediate updates can be achieved via a push notification system. In this paper, we present a push notification system based on HiveMQ Community Edition message broker, that provides end-to-end positive (ACK) and negative (NACK) acknowledgments, strict authentication, and authorization of users and messages, security, data consistency, and privacy. The realized system has been integrated and tested in the E@syCare telemedicine platform certified as a medical device, but it can be easily adopted by any other telemedicine solutions, as long as they can perform web service requests to the authentication server and integrate HiveMQ client library in their software components.

AB  - This article discusses the problem of studying the risks associated with information and communication systems of medical organizations in the context of their digital transformation and with the storage of medical data in a cloud geographically distributed infrastructure. Information about the health status of patients, their personal data and the results of medical research are classified as confidential information, which is the object of increased attention of cybercriminals. The widespread transformation of healthcare organizations, the creation of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) ecosystems based on wireless sensor networks are increasing the number of potential risks of confidential information leakage. Medical data requires constant protection. The problem of identifying risks in order to develop methods and tools for their management in the future is further complicated by the fact that Healthcare Industry is increasingly beginning to use the cloud architecture of the IoMT, which in turn increases the potential threats to patients' confidential information. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of ransomware programs that are being introduced into IoMT devices has increased, cyberattacks are becoming more complex with a significantly higher risk of fatal consequences for patients due to changes in the technical parameters of medical equipment by attackers. This makes it urgent to solve the problem of identifying possible risks in IoMT tools and systems, assessing their impact and possible consequences from unauthorized actions of intruders for patients and the medical organization as a whole.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) based smart health and wellness systems are increasingly gaining popularity for the next generation of medical services. Systems of medical devices that communicate seamlessly integrated and securely can improve patient outcomes, reduce medical errors, lower costs and overcome the existing medical systems limitations. While these innovative medical systems are emerging, they also bring new challenges as data protection and power management. This paper proposes an IoT architecture that allows to collect and analyze huge volumes of heterogeneous clinical data in order to monitor health status of patients and improve clinical decision support, by tackling the energy shortage challenge. The key feature of the proposed approach is a power-aware strategy based on energy load balancing in order to keep on the greatest number of power operated devices involved in the computational tasks. The paper presents a case study of power-aware smart health monitoring exploiting different types of data mining techniques. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the approach able to achieve energy savings by means of the proposed power-aware strategy.

AB  - The advancement in automation and medical care technologies in recent decade has changed the traditional medical treatment of patients. Although, these technologies have increased the treatment’s precision but the growing number and the complexity of IoT healthcare devices are impacting accuracy along with several other challenges. Moreover, the use of different programming languages, operating platforms and data management methodologies are creating restrictions in safe exchange, integration and reuse of information across different applications. However, with the advent of the semantic web, the semantic technologies are growing in healthcare systems due to the capability of machine interpretation and processing by overcoming the restriction of languages and data heterogeneity. The most common shortcoming in the existing systems are the context-awareness and quality of services and the absence of rich patient ontology; leading towards low accuracy of results. To this aim, this paper provides a smart health framework, consisting on the collection and processing of IoT data (related to patient conditions and context). The framework is supported by the patient ontology along with SWRL rules for better decision making that consider different features (context-awareness and quality of services) differently that results in the improved accuracy. In the evaluation process the proposed work has achieved an accuracy of 89.81%. This work will help the practitioners to treat the patients in a better way.

AB  - The pervasiveness of newly introduced Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices has opened up new opportunities in healthcare systems, for example in facilitating remote patient monitoring. There are, however, security and privacy considerations in the transmission of data from these devices to the backend server, and across heterogeneous IoT networks. In this study, we propose a novel privacy-preserving scheme which is based on blockchain and swarm exchange techniques to facilitate seamless and secure transmission of user data (e.g., electronic health record (EHR)-related information) through secured swarm nodes of peer-to-peer communications. BIoTHR refers to the proposed scheme on the private blockchain-assisted EHR management using IoT. Specifically, new blockchain and swarm exchange infrastructures are suggested as a backbone of the proposed scheme to ensure secure and reliable data transmission and timely monitoring of data sent across IoT networks. An autonomous encryption-decryption mechanism is also utilized, along with a dynamic and modular server assistance technology to deploy EHR transmission in a secure manner. Moreover, several swarm-listen, announcement, peer open and peer closing algorithms are incorporated to employ the actual power of pervasive EHR transmission for better e-healthcare service provisioning. The proposed scheme is developed using the open-source tools of GnuPG, IPFS, and Golang. Proposed study simulates a number of heterogeneous IoT-based health sensor nodes, namely, body temperature, pulse rate, and oxygen saturation, i.e., SPO2, galvanic skin response, and blood glucose in blockchain-assisted swarm exchange framework. The results reveal that the proposed scheme, in terms of blockchain-IoT, swarm exchange and EHR transmission, outperforms several peer techniques.

AB  - Smart homecare utilises advanced technologies to support, improve and promote remote healthcare in homes and communities through collecting and analysing health data and sharing this knowledge with carers and clinicians. With the continuous growth in the world’s older population, smart homecare becomes increasingly crucial in providing in-home care for older adults, allowing the vital healthcare dollars to go further into other critical care needs. In addition, with the rise in the development and utilisation of innovative technologies in healthcare settings, it is vital to ensure that these technologies are guided and approved by the corresponding regulatory bodies such as FDA (Foods and Drug Administration) in the USA and TGA (Therapeutic Good Administration) in Australia. With this premise, this paper identifies four dimensions for researchers to consider when developing smart homecare solutions for in-home remote care: Technology, Data, People, and Operational Environment. The essential interplays amongst these four dimensions are discussed to identify the various enablers and barriers in the successful delivery of smart homecare solutions. As the primary output of this paper, it proposes a conceptual framework to achieve practical in-home care for the older population living independently with the support of technology, while addressing the challenges such as security and privacy of patient data. Secondly, a comprehensive and practical guide featuring seven phases is presented to support and direct researchers in implementing smart homecare solutions for remote care. The proposed framework and the guide aim to make smart homecare research practical and truly translational into broader practice.

AB  - The article draws inspiration from IEEE Digital Privacy, which explores attaining privacy goals for individuals in the digital realm. Privacy is an umbrella term that equates to respect for an individual’s dignity. When it integrates with digital technology, it alludes to individuals’ right and authority to control the flow of their personally identifiable information (PII) on the digital platform. Adopting digital technology in healthcare is not novel, but the COVID-19 outbreak has accelerated its incorporation into healthcare. Digital technology perks a wide range of healthcare professions, including biomedicine, diagnostic imaging, and remote patient monitoring, to mention a few, through facilitating accurate and effective health-related decisions. Thanks to technological advancements, healthcare professionals and other medical personnel are now quickly accessing and retaining patient information, which aids in scouring for optimal and swiftly acted-upon medications. While the technology’s inception is positive, it raised privacy issues for patients’ PII and other sensitive health data that remain intact. The review article addresses the key challenges in digital privacy for healthcare while also reviewing the state-of-the-art work by investigating data encryption techniques, access control mechanisms, and risk assessment techniques with digital privacy as a primary concern. Every country has enacted resilient laws and regulations to protect digital privacy in healthcare, which are briefed in the article. Artificial intelligence (AI) has proven valuable in cybersecurity and healthcare technology growth. As a result, the article delves into the hurdles of employing AI for healthcare digital privacy and cutting-edge work in healthcare digital privacy using AI. Finally, the article concludes with a future vision of data privacy in healthcare.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) is being adopted widely impacting every sphere around us. IoT enabled health-care is making the way ahead as it enables remote monitoring of health status seamlessly. The health-care industry historically has generated a large volume of data. With the induction of IoT, this volume has gone up drastically. Therefore, the health data is required to be stored properly to make sense of the data. In this paper, we propose cloudlet assisted IoT enabled e-Health framework. This e-Health framework aims to ease real-time data access using cloudlets. In this framework, we propose and implement a health-care data management scheme to store the enormous health data and process the queries for retrieval of the health data by end-users. We have used NoSQL based model to store health data. Performance of the proposed model has been studied in terms of data transmission time, energy consumption, query response time and data packet loss. Finally, by comparing the evaluation results of our proposed model with performances of the traditional cloud storage-based e-Health system, we justified that our proposed model is performing far better than existing cloud-based e-Health solutions.

AB  - Maternal mortality ratio (MMR) of non-developing and developing countries stipulate that every year an enormous number of pregnant women succumbed to death due to lack of proper healthcare service. In the case of Bangladesh, maximum maternal deaths happen in the rural and hill-tracts area due to the communication gap during the emergency moments. To solve this situation, in this study, we have proposed multiple sensor-based systems that focus on the issue of complete health monitoring of an expecting mother. We envisioned to target the expecting mothers who are most of the time-deprived of complete health monitoring during the pregnancy time. Our developed system consists of non-invasive anemia and glucose rate detection, sudden fall detection, heart rate, and body temperature. We have also incorporated Wi-Fi and GSM modules in our device to make it viable for telemonitoring. To monitor all these physical parameters, we have also introduced a custom-made android application. These would allow the expecting mothers to assess their health conditions. The doctors and family members would also get notified through SMS if there is an emergency. The outcome of this research would help the health service providers to envision a different approach to give proper healthcare facilties to expecting mothers, specially in the rural areas.

AB  - So, let us begin with Machine learning (ML), which is a type of neural network (AI) that empowers software programmers to start increasing prediction without being done with full to do so. Because data is so valuable, improving strategies for intelligently having to manage the now-ubiquitous content infrastructures is a necessary part of the process toward completely autonomous agents. Computer vision and computer vision have improved a wide range of industries, including medical diagnoses, data display and procedures, science and research, and so on A number of tiny IoT devices on the market for heart rate sensor, allowing patients to roam about freely while their hearts are continually monitored. It is still difficult to guarantee ultra-accurate findings, however most current instruments can achieve accuracy rates of over 90 percentage... Monitoring cardiac rhythms, as well as glucose levels, may be challenging, and even those who are represented at medical institutions. Intermittent heart rate assessments cannot protect against sudden changes in vital signs, and standard techniques of heart rhythm surveillance used in hospitals require patients to be permanently attached to wired apparatus, limiting their mobility.

AB  - In today's technological climate, users require fast automation and digitization of results for large amounts of data at record speeds. Especially in the field of medicine, where each patient is often asked to undergo many different examinations within one diagnosis or treatment. Each examination can help in the diagnosis or prediction of further disease progression. Furthermore, all produced data from these examinations must be stored somewhere and available to various medical practitioners for analysis who may be in geographically diverse locations. The current medical climate leans towards remote patient monitoring and AI-assisted diagnosis. To make this possible, medical data should ideally be secured and made accessible to many medical practitioners, which makes them prone to malicious entities. Medical information has inherent value to malicious entities due to its privacy-sensitive nature in a variety of ways. Furthermore, if access to data is distributively made available to AI algorithms (particularly neural networks) for further analysis/diagnosis, the danger to the data may increase (e.g., model poisoning with fake data introduction). In this paper, we propose a federated learning approach that uses decentralized learning with blockchain-based security and a proposition that accompanies that training intelligent systems using distributed and locally-stored data for the use of all patients. Our work in progress hopes to contribute to the latest trend of the Internet of Medical Things security and privacy.

AB  - The CAPABLE project has been funded by the European Union to develop a telemonitoring and coaching platform improving the quality of life for cancer patients. The platform, based on a multi agent blackboard architecture, is classified as a medical device according to the current EU regulation. Thus it needs extensive tests before being put into service for the planned clinical trials, which calls for a dedicated simulating and testing environment. Materials and Methods: Coordination in CAPABLE is achieved through the Case Manager, a component able to generate and notify events to other interested agent components. For representing and exchanging health care information we have adopted HL7 FHIR as a semantic interoperability standard. Results: FHIR has been exploited to design a structured history of a real patient affected by renal cell carcinoma. A simulator has been developed for automating the whole testing process represented by specific scenarios of the patient’s history. Conclusions: The simulator relies on the events produced by the Case Manager for coordinating the agents. This proved to be effective in checking that the agents reactions to new data showing up on the blackboard comply with the expected behavior.

AB  - The rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) stimulates the innovation for the health-related devices such as remote patient monitoring, connected inhalers and ingestible sensors. Simultaneously, with the aid of numerous equipments, a great number of collected data can be used for disease prediction or diagnosis model establishment. However, the potential patient data leak will also bring privacy and security issues in the interaction period. To deal with these existing issues, we propose a decentralized, efficient, and privacy-enhanced federated edge learning system called DEEP-FEL, which enables medical devices in different institutions to collaboratively train a global model without raw data mutual exchange. Firstly, we design a hierarchical ring topology to alleviate centralization of the conventional training framework, and formulate the ring construction as an optimization problem, which can be solved by an efficient heuristic algorithm. Subsequently, we design an efficient parameter aggregation algorithm for distributed medical institutions to generate a new global model, and the total amount of data transmitted by N nodes is only $2/N$ times that of traditional algorithm. In addition, data security among different medical institutions is enhanced by adding artificial noise to the edge model. Finally, experimental results on three medical datasets demonstrate the superiority of our system.

AB  - In order to conserve energy in the Internet of Things (IoT) network and also effectively handle the integrity and security issues in medical information, a framework for transmitting data that is both secure and energy efficient was proposed. It was used Enhanced Mayfly Clustering-based Q Learner Routing (EMCQLR) and Exponential Key-based Elliptical Curve Cryptography (EKECC) techniques. In EMCQLR, Enhanced Mayfly optimization Algorithm (EMOA) was used to select the Cluster Head (CH) for data collection from the nodes and form clusters of IoT medical sensors. This paper proposes a new approach called EMOA with Active Elite Approach (EMOA-AEA) to deal with the issues of slow convergence speed and the tendency of EMOA to fall into local optimum. The EMOA-AEA algorithm establishes a definite area around the most optimal mayfly in the present population, which is used to identify the top-performing CH. This region’s search radius is then adjusted as needed. Elite mayflies are subsequently produced within this designated zone, and if their fitness level surpasses that of the most exceptional mayfly, the finest cluster head from these new elite mayflies is selected to replace the current population’s top mayfly. After the selection of cluster head, Path-Weighted Q Reinforcement Learning (PWQRL) is used for data routing. At last, EKECC algorithm encrypts the medical records to provide data security. The experimental outcomes prove that the EMOA-AEA method surpasses the existing method in terms of network lifetime, average energy consumption, and throughput.

AB  - The Computing Continuum, covering Cloud, Fog, and Edge systems, promises to provide on-demand resource-as-a-service for Internet applications with diverse requirements, ranging from extremely low latency to high-performance processing. However, eminent challenges in automating the resources man-agement of Big Data pipelines across the Computing Continuum remain. The resource management and adaptation for Big Data pipelines across the Computing Continuum require significant research effort, as the current data processing pipelines are dynamic. In contrast, traditional resource management strategies are static, leading to inefficient pipeline scheduling and overly complex process deployment. To address these needs, we propose in this work a scheduling and adaptation approach implemented as a software tool to lower the technological barriers to the management of Big Data pipelines over the Computing Continuum. The approach separates the static scheduling from the run-time execution, em-powering domain experts with little infrastructure and software knowledge to take an active part in the Big Data pipeline adaptation. We conduct a feasibility study using a digital healthcare use case to validate our approach. We illustrate concrete scenarios supported by demonstrating how the scheduling and adaptation tool and its implementation automate the management of the lifecycle of a remote patient monitoring, treatment, and care pipeline.

AB  - The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is a new paradigm in the IoT-based healthcare and medical applications which has brought many advantages to this. Increasing in the number of smart medical devices has led to security challenges within IoMT environments. Cryptography and other cuttingedge approaches have been widely used to mitigate the challenges and prevent sensitive data leakage. One of such approaches is the attribute-based encryption (ABE), which enables a fine-grained and flexible access control. However, the ABE does not provide a dynamic encryption mechanism when patients’ conditions change over the period of remote monitoring. To address this, we present a novel security architecture for IoMT that relies on ciphertext policy attributebased encryption (CP-ABE). The architecture applies a dynamic access structure for the encryption in accordance with the status of the medical data collected by IoMT devices. We define some new components mainly hosted on the IoMT gateways in order to encrypt and decrypt the medical data in the architecture. An IoMT use case is presented to show how our proposed architecture supports dynamic encryption in ehealthcare systems.

AB  - Smart health systems have the potential to improve the life and the provided health quality. Since the collaborative working is important in healthcare, the integration of Blockchain for the distribution of real-time patient health becomes more and more important because non-authorized access can result in health risks or private information disclosure. Many Blockchain healthcare applications have been proposed to manage the patient information, however, there is still a lack of providing a smart real-time healthcare monitoring and tracking system. This paper therefore proposes a Real-Time Healthcare system (RTH-Care) based on Blockchain technology that supports the life cycle of a patient in the healthcare system. In particular, we improve the quality of the healthcare system by ensuring a consensus around tests and information about the patients and by centralizing the prescription system. Furthermore, we collect patient health data by integrating medical IoT devices. Subsequently, we provide a data access control to restrict access to the granted persons. The performance analysis of the implementation of RTH-Care with the Hyperledger Fabric tool is showing promising results. An analysis of the communication failures is discussed by using Hyperledger Caliper. Indeed, the obtained results show that our solution is reliable and scalable in terms of the number of transactions per second processed by the network, and the average latency measurements.

AB  - The growing use of multimedia applications in digital health (eHealth) has highlighted the need for secure communication protocols to protect sensitive patient data. Security is expected as a crucial requirement also of future sixth-generation (6G) networks, which represent a valuable means to favor the definitive development of eHealth, hitherto hindered by the insufficient adequacy of technologies. In particular, device-to-device (D2D) has already emerged in previous generations of cellular networks as a promising solution to enable fast and reliable data exchange between devices, and it is expected to be an enabling technology of forthcoming 6G networks as well. However, the security of D2D communication in eHealth is a major concern due to the possibility of unauthorized access and data breaches. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an authentication protocol to secure D2D communications established to support the development of eHealth multimedia applications in 6G-oriented networks. The conducted performance evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed protocol in achieving secure and reliable D2D communications and shows the benefits offered by the proposed solution in terms of energy savings.

AB  - Rapid technological progress has allowed for the creation of novel healthcare solutions that aims to improve patient care and monitoring. Data security and privacy are given high priority in the proposed system, which is a health monitoring platform that leverages the capabilities of the Internet of Things (IOT) and deep learning methods like Transformers in RNN to gather and analyse health data with high precision. For reliable anomaly detection, early risk prediction, and individualized healthcare recommendations, deep learning algorithms are used to sift through the data. The main objective of this research is to design an efficient model for strong authentication to improve the security levels. Given the delicate nature of individual health information, security and privacy are of the utmost importance in health monitoring systems. The SHMS addresses these issues by incorporating strong authentication and encryption technologies to protect information at rest and in transit. An individual's right to decide how their personal health data is used is also carefully protected by these systems. This study describes a major advancement in healthcare technology: a system for secure, accurate, and real-time health monitoring that uses the Internet of Things and a Transformer-based RNN in deep learning. This technology not only improves the ability of healthcare providers to provide timely and effective care, but also protects the privacy and security of patient data. This research presents a Multi-Level Node Authorization and Access Control Model with Dual Key Authentication using Recurrent Neural Networks (MLNA-ACM-DKA-RNN) for secure health monitoring system. The proposed model when compared with the traditional models exhibit better performance.

AB  - Over the years, the healthcare industry has transformed from being hospital-centric to patient-centric. This shift is mainly due to the convergence of emergent technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT)-based healthcare, fifth generation (5G)-assisted networking, and data-driven analytics through artificial intelligence. The convergence, referred to as Healthcare 5.0, has improved healthcare services to support real-time analytics, user mobility, remote monitoring, and personalized user experience through decentralized applications. However, the medical supply chain systems and delivery operations among healthcare stakeholders suffer from limitations of harsh environmental conditions due to restricted zones, rough terrains, war-prone areas, poor road conditions, congested traffic, and remote locations. Thus, the Internet of Drones (IoD) is deployed in Healthcare 5.0 supply chains to streamline and expedite the medical delivery process through open channels (i.e. the Internet). However, the Internet is an open channel that is prone to malicious activities which can violate the privacy and confidentiality of patient data. Blockchain is a promising technology that can handle the security and reliability of drone delivery among untrusted open channels. Motivated by the aforementioned facts, we propose GaRuDa, a blockchain-based drone delivery scheme for Healthcare 5.0 applications. The proposed scheme integrates IoD and blockchain through 5G-enabled tactile Internet to facilitate low-latency responsive delivery of medical supplies that can be chronologically monitored and tracked among different stakeholders. We compared the proposed scheme with the traditional medical delivery scheme with payment gateways to demonstrate its effectiveness in terms of data storage, computation, and communication costs. The simulation results obtained show that the average transaction cost has been reduced by ≈ 44.56 percent, and 5G tactile Internet has a reduced latency of 0.051 ms compared to 18.3 ms in 4G LTE service. The average communication overheads have reduced by ≈ 67.34 percent compared to traditional 4G LTE and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing channels, which indicates the scheme's viability.

AB  - Medicine has been chiefly a reactionary profession throughout history. Even today, one has to wait until diseases have manifested before attempting to treat or cure them. And because the genetic and environmental components that contribute to major diseases like Cancer, Alzheimer’s and cardiovascular diseases are not fully understandable, our efforts to treat them are often haphazard, unpredictable, and inefficient. As a result, the drugs and therapies developed are evaluated on large groups of people and given based on statical averages. And because of the genetic variances, they function for some patients but not for others. Every prescription medicine now on the market only works for half of the people who take it. Based on each patient’s unique genetic composition and environment circumstances, personalized medicine is a critical milestone to be attained to address this issue. Artificial intelligence and blockchain have recently been innovations in the healthcare industry. Furthermore, blockchain can control patient data privacy among participants. It uses asymmetric cryptography to secure transactions between users without the need for any intermediary or a trusted third party, thanks to smart contracts. On the other hand, Artificial intelligence provides intellect and decision-making capabilities for robots similar to humans. This study also identifies and analyses open research problems associated with blockchain and artificial intelligence in personalized medicine.

AB  - This research study proposes the development of comprehensive vital sign surveillance designed for real-time patient assessment. The system integrates multiple sensors, including the LM35 temperature sensor, Heartbeat Rate (HBR) and Blood Oxygen (SpO2) Sensor, DHT11 humidity and temperature sensor, OLED display, and gyroscope sensor, to provide a holistic approach to vital signs. The LM35 sensor is employed for accurate temperature measurement, providing crucial data for monitoring the patient's thermal status. This information is essential for detecting fever or abnormal temperature variations, aiding in the early identification of potential health issues. The HBR and SpO2 sensor plays a vital role in cardiovascular vital signs. The system can assess the patient's cardiac and respiratory well-being by measuring the heart rate and blood oxygen levels. Abnormalities in these parameters can trigger timely alerts, enabling swift medical intervention. The DHT11 sensor enhances the system's capabilities by monitoring ambient temperature and humidity. This additional environmental data contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the patient's surroundings, ensuring that external factors are considered in the health assessment process. Integrating an OLED display serves as an intuitive user interface, providing real-time feedback on the measured parameters. This ensures that patients and healthcare providers can easily interpret and respond to the health data presented by the system. The display can showcase temperature, humidity, heart rate, blood oxygen levels, and other relevant information in a user-friendly format. Furthermore, the gyroscope sensor adds a layer of sophistication to vital sign surveillance by enabling the assessment of body movement and posture. This feature is particularly beneficial for patients with mobility issues or those prone to falls. The gyroscope data can be analyzed to detect sudden movements or abnormal postures, triggering alerts to caregivers or healthcare professionals. The system is designed for user convenience, ensuring ease of use and portability. Wireless connectivity options can be incorporated, allowing data to be transmitted to a centralized monitoring platform or a mobile application. This enables remote monitoring, facilitating timely interventions and improving patient outcomes. The proposed vital sign surveillance has the potential to revolutionize personalized healthcare by providing continuous, non-intrusive monitoring in real time. The multi-sensor integration allows for a more nuanced and comprehensive assessment of the patient's health status, enabling early detection of potential issues and facilitating proactive healthcare interventions.

AB  - Data generated from various dynamic applications of Internet of Things (IoT) based healthcare technology is effectively used for decision-making, providing reliable and smart healthcare services to the elderly and patients with chronic diseases. Since these precious data are susceptible to various security attacks, continuous monitoring of the system's compliance and identification of security risks in IoT data propagation is essential through potentially several layers of applications. This paper pinpoints how security-aware data provenance graphs can support compliance checking and risk estimation by including sufficient information on security controls and other security-relevant evidence. Real-time analysis of these security evidence to enable a step-wise validation and providing the evidence of this validation to end-users is currently not possible with the available data. This paper analyzes the security concerns in different phases of data propagation in a designed IoT-health scenario and promotes step-wise validation of security evidence. It proposes a system model with a novel protocol that documents and verifies evidence for security controls for data-object relations in data provenance graphs to assist compliance checking of security regulation of healthcare systems. With this regard, this paper discusses the proposed system model design with the requirements for technical safeguards of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Based on the verification output at each phase, the proposed protocol reports this chain of verification by creating certain security tokens. Finally, the paper provides a formal security validation and security design analysis to show the applicability of this step-wise validation within the proposed system model.

AB  - Technological development expands the computation process of smart devices that adopt the telecare medical information system (TMIS) to fulfill the demands of the healthcare organization. It provides better medical identification to claim the features namely trustworthy, efficient, and resourceful. Moreover, the telecare services automate the remote healthcare monitoring process to ease professional workloads. Importantly, it is conceived to be more timesaving, economical, and easy healthcare access. Cloud-Based Medical Healthcare (CBMH) system is a standard platform that gives its support to the patients for emergency treatment from the medical experts over Internet communication. Since the medical records are very sensitive, security protection is much necessitated. In addition, patient anonymity should be well preserved. In 2016, Chiou et al. proposed a mutual authentication protocol for the Telecare Medical Information System (TMIS) using Cloud Environment (CE). They claim that their protocol satisfies patient anonymity. However, this paper proves that the Chiou et al. scheme is not only completely insecure against the patient anonymity, health-report revelation, health-report forgery, report confidentiality, and non-repudiation but also fails to validate the service access against verifiability, undeniability and unforgeability. In order to provide better mutual authenticity, this paper suggests the framework of smart service authentication to cross-examine the common secret session key among the communication entities. In order to examine the security properties, formal and informal verification was carried out. Lastly, to prove the security and performance efficiency of a system, the proposed SSA framework was implemented using FPGA and Moteiv TMote Sky-Mote. A proposed smart service authentication (SSA) framework is presented to ensure better data security between the patients and the physicians. The formal and informal security analysis proves the significance of the SSA framework model to withstand the security attacks such as health-report forgery, health-report revelation, server-spoofing etc. As a result, it is claimed that it can be well suited for TMIS.

AB  - In recent years, there has been a surge in IoT healthcare applications, ranging from wearable health monitors and remote patient monitoring systems to smart medical devices, telemedicine platforms, and personalized health tracking and management tools. The purpose of these applications is to improve treatment outcomes, streamline healthcare delivery, and enable data-driven decision-making. However, due to the sensitive nature of health data and the critical role that these applications play in people’s lives, ensuring their security and privacy has become a paramount concern. To address this issue, we developed an explainable malicious traffic detection and monitoring system based on Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models. The proposed system involves the use of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods such as LIME, SHAP, ELI5, and Integrated Gradients(IG) to ensure the interpretability and explainability of the developed models. Finally, we demonstrate the high accuracy of the developed models in detecting attacks on the intensive care patient dataset. Furthermore, we ensure the transparency and interpretability of the model outcomes by presenting them through the Shapash Monitor interface, which can be easily accessed by both experts and non-experts.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) for medical purposes offers a number of benefits, including the aptitude to follow the individual's physical state over a range of time intervals and transmitting data in real time. Using gadgets like glucose meters, heart monitoring implants, Electrocardiogram (ECG), blood pressure monitors, Electroencephalography (EEG) and Electromyography (EMG) wearable strategies, medical personnel can gather local patient wellness data and make choices based on it. The IoT devices' weak authentication and encryption procedures make them readily hackable and may expose users to a number of risks, some of which could be fatal. The Quality of Service (QoS) needs for healthcare IoT devices, such as dependability, authorization, identity and security, cannot be met by current algorithms using machine learning or blockchain approaches operating in the cloud computing environment. Henceforth the proposed work develops an advanced Fog computing (FC) to oppose advance cloud computing at an edge of networks together with Block chain topology. Fog computing has been emphasized as promising method for low-cost remote monitoring, limiting down on latency, and boosting efficiency, while blockchain has been touted for guaranteeing the security of private data, building a decentralized database, and improving data interoperability. The problem of healthcare IoT device recognition, permission and confirmation for scalability often broadcast of data in a distributed setting can be handled by merging FC with block chain. So, leveraging FC and blockchain, a creative solution to the aforementioned issue.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of physical objects or things that can communicate and share information. In IoT-enabled Wireless Medical Sensor Network (WMSN), the smart sensing devices share remote patient monitoring data towards central repositories. During medical data aggregation and transmission, security is mandatory to guard against intruders. The main problem in existing base schemes is that complex multiplication operations are used for batch key creation. These schemes are computationally expensive and require huge memory space at the aggregator node (AN). This paper presents a lightweight Secure Aggregation and Transmission Scheme (SATS) for secure and lightweight data computation and transmission. SATS provides a lightweight XOR operation for obtaining batch keys instead of the expensive multiplication operation. Furthermore, the AN Receiving Message Algorithm (ARMA) is presented at the AN to aggregate data generated by sensor nodes. The Receiving Message Extractor (RME) algorithm is presented to decrypt the message and perform batch verification at the Fog-Server. SATS protects against several security threats such as denial of service attacks, the man in the middle attack, and reply attacks. The proposed SATS is simulated by using simulation tool NS 2.35. The results show that SATS provides lightweight data transmission by reducing computation and communication costs.The computation cost of the SATS scheme is 14%, 23% and 59% at AN, and at Fog-Node 6.5%, 21.5% and 51%, and Communication cost 6%, 3%, and 4% at Sensor Node, and at AN 6%, 9%, and 12% better than PPDAS, IDAP, and ASAS respectively. The proposed SATS is compared with relevant schemes and the results show that it provides better storage capacity, computations cost, communications cost, and energy consumption.

With the aid of IoT-enabled devices, monitoring and analyzing patient diagnostic parameters is substantially facilitated. A paradigm change in healthcare technology is represented by IoMT. However, issues with patients’ right to privacy and data security continue to exist. Blockchain has permeated several scientific fields and is expected to grow dramatically. Blockchain smart contracts can eliminate intermediaries and increase contract execution. Blockchain and smart contracts in IoMT e-healthcare are discussed in this paper. The study analyses how decentralisation and smart contracts will affect the IoMT in e-healthcare, suggests a new architecture, and discusses the benefits, drawbacks, and future trends of integrating all three. The suggested architecture outperforms standard techniques in packet delivery ratio, latency, and energy efficiency.
