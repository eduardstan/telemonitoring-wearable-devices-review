AB  - Stroke is one of the leading causes of disability among the elderly population and is a significant public health problem worldwide. The main impact of stroke is functional disabilities due to motor impairment after stroke. Advances in modern medicine and technology have significantly improved diagnosis and treatment; however, most post-stroke care is based on the effectiveness of rehabilitation. Stroke rehabilitation depends on two main components: (i) training (or therapy) to restore the patient to pre-stroke mobility and (ii) assessing motor functionality of affected patients performing activities to track motor recovery. This article highlights how combining wearable devices and machine learning (ML) produces new pathways for effective stroke rehabilitation. While wearable devices help capture patient movements at much finer time resolutions, ML allows us to build predictive models from wearable data to assist clinicians in diagnosis and treatments. Specifically, we expand on how wearable devices and ML can improve monitoring quality in training intervention, assessment, and remote monitoring. In addition, we provide our main findings from the literature, research challenges, and future directions in post-stroke therapies using wearable devices and ML.

AB  - Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is an intriguing approach to healthcare monitoring that necessitates the ongoing utilization of wearable sensors to capture everyday activities. The most advanced studies using wearable devices have used a cloud computing paradigm that categorized data at remote systems. This method has drawbacks in terms of energy consumption, latency, and privacy. As a result, we adhere to a low-power computing structure in which wearable device solutions achieve an acceptable level of performance while being energy and memory-efficient. This study proposes a lightweight deep learning model termed a gate recurrent unit (GRU) network for energy-efficient HAR appropriate for low-power wearable devices. The introduced GRU network is evaluated against a benchmark dataset named the w-HAR dataset, including essential deep learning networks. The proposed GRU surpasses baseline deep learning networks in terms of overall accuracy, with a score of 95.160%.

AB  - There are three technologies that highly contributed to the development of our life. Those technologies are Internet of Things (IoT), Machine Learning (ML) and Block Chain. Recently, IoT and ML played important role in healthcare monitoring management through self-management. Self-management resulted in effective treatment in a lower cost. The IoT uses sensors to monitor the patients' health and collect data from patients, transfer these data to ML for extraction, classification and mining, and use the pure data for prediction of the diseases. This facilitates communication between doctor and patient through wearable technologies. The objective is to provide real-time monitoring of chronic diseases such as heart failure, asthma, diabetes, heart attacks etc. So we present a full review of the IoT based ML techniques for healthcare applications.

AB  - Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) is a special purpose wireless sensors network designed to connect various self-autonomous medical sensors and appliances located inside and outside of human body. Interests in human Healthcare Monitoring System (HMS) are based on WBAN due to the increasing aging population and chronically ill patients at home. HMS is expected to reduce healthcare expenses by enabling the continuous monitoring of patient’s health remotely in daily life activities. This research focuses on routing protocols in WBAN. The major problems in routing protocols are maximum energy consumption, path loss ratio, packet delivery ratio and maintaining stable signal to noise ratio. Real time analysis is required in HMS to support the patients through doctors, caregivers and hospital systems. Collected data is relayed by using existing wireless communication schemes towards the access point for further retransmission and processing. In this research, an Improved Quality of Service aware Routing Protocol (IM-QRP) is proposed for WBAN based HMS to remotely monitor the elderly people or chronically ill patients in hospitals and residential environments. The proposed protocol is capable to improve 10% residual energy, 30% reduction in path loss ratio, 10% improvement in packet transmission (link reliability) and 7% improvement in SNR as compared to existing CO-LEEBA and QPRD routing protocols. Convolutional Neural Network is used outside the WBAN environment to analyze the medical health records for healthcare diagnosis and intelligent decision-making.

AB  - Current remote monitoring of COVID-19 patients relies on manual symptom reporting, which is highly dependent on patient compliance. In this research, we present a machine learning (ML)-based remote monitoring method to estimate patient recovery from COVID-19 symptoms using automatically collected wearable device data, instead of relying on manually collected symptom data. We deploy our remote monitoring system, namely eCOVID, in two COVID-19 telemedicine clinics. Our system utilizes a Garmin wearable and symptom tracker mobile app for data collection. The data consists of vitals, lifestyle, and symptom information which is fused into an online report for clinicians to review. Symptom data collected via our mobile app is used to label the recovery status of each patient daily. We propose a ML-based binary patient recovery classifier which uses wearable data to estimate whether a patient has recovered from COVID-19 symptoms. We evaluate our method using leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation, and find that Random Forest (RF) is the top performing model. Our method achieves an F1-score of 0.88 when applying our RF-based model personalization technique using weighted bootstrap aggregation. Our results demonstrate that ML-assisted remote monitoring using automatically collected wearable data can supplement or be used in place of manual daily symptom tracking which relies on patient compliance.

But the realization of this would need a lot of time. Internet of Things is still in a primary stage and development has a long way to go. Wide range applications for IoT require infrastructure, application architecture, security measures and a standard system is yet to be established. By introducing IoT, several challenges, constraints, security concerns have to be addressed differently unlike the currently existing data systems. The current systems use make use of easy to implement standards and these are compatible for most of the devices used in communications and storage systems. But no such standard exists for devices using IoT owing to the various constraints arising between different devices that results in different classifications within IoT itself. It also discusses the requirement of security architectures for IoT and feasible mechanisms that can be implemented for various architecture layers of IoT for e-Health applications. The challenges faced in order to integrate IoT into health care applications are also discussed alongside the standards and security mechanisms. IoT can be considered as a key to providing improved medical facilities for patients whilst facilitating doctors, staff and hospitals. Most importantly, this work presents the ways to handle security for implementing IoT in healthcare sector not only in the currently existing systems but also for future applications. The current systems that use various domains and different technologies have been studied and analyzed to present a clear and precise solutions to challenges faced by IoT implementations as of today.This electronic document is a “live” template and already defines the components of you

AB  - Asthma is a chronic condition that affects the air passages in the lungs, causing symptoms such as cough, wheeze, shortness of breath, and chest tightness, which can be triggered by various factors including viral infections, dust, smoke, pollen, and soaps. It can affect patients’ daily lives in many harsh, debilitating ways, severe cases can lead to emergency health care, hospitalization, and even death. Although asthma can’t be cured, good management with inhaled medications can control the disease and enable people with asthma to lead a normal, active life. One of the ways in which asthma management becomes easier is the prediction of severity of asthma exacerbations in a patient. This model utilizes sensors and data collected from IoT devices and smartphones to predict asthma risk and severity. The model is trained on a dataset of asthma patients and takes into account various factors such as symptoms, triggers, and objective test results. The model is integrated with a non-invasive wearable device through bluetooth. The device itself adopts the latest IoT technologies to collect data about the patient’s whereabouts, their triggers as well as the condition of their disease. As the wearable device collects information from the sensor, this data is stored in the web application, where it can be compared to the previously collected readings to predict the severity of the asthma patient. The web application provides an interface between the patient and the data collected for prediction. This system significantly benefits asthma patients by providing a way to manage their condition better.

AB  - One of the major healthcare challenges is elderly fallers. A fall can lead to disabilities and even mortality. With the current Covid-19 pandemic, insufficient resources could be provided for the care of elderlies, and care workers often may not be able to visit them. Therefore, a fall may get undetected or delayed leading to serious harm or consequences. Automatic fall detection systems could provide the necessary detection and warnings for timely intervention. Although many sensor-based fall detection systems have been proposed, most systems focus on the sudden fall and have not considered the slow fall scenario, a typical fall instance for elderly fallers. In this paper, a robust activity (RA) and slow fall detection system is proposed. The system consists of a waist-worn wearable sensor embedded with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a barometer, and a reference ambient barometer. A deep neural network (DNN) is developed for fusing the sensor data and classifying fall events. The results have shown that the IMU-barometer design yield better detection of fall events and the DNN approach (90.33% accuracy) outperforms traditional machine learning algorithms.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize healthcare by automating the detection and classification of events and anomalies. In the scope of this work, events and anomalies are abnormalities in the patient’s data, where the former are due to a medical condition, such as a seizure or a fall, and the latter are erroneous data due to faults or malicious attacks. AI-based event and anomaly detection (EAD) and their classification can improve patient outcomes by identifying problems earlier, enabling more timely interventions while minimizing false alarms caused by anomalies. Moreover, the advancement of Medical Internet of Things (MIoT), or wearable devices, and their high processing capabilities facilitated the gathering, AI-based processing, and transmission of data, which enabled remote patient monitoring, and personalized and predictive healthcare. However, it is fundamental in healthcare to ensure the explainability of AI systems, meaning that they can provide understandable and transparent reasoning for their decisions. This article proposes an online EAD approach using a lightweight autoencoder (AE) on the MIoT. The detected abnormality is explained using KernelSHAP, an explainable AI (XAI) technique, where the explanation of the abnormality is used, by an artificial neural network (ANN), to classify it into an event or anomaly. Intensive simulations are conducted using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) data set for various physiological data. Results showed the robustness of the proposed approach in the detection and classification of events, regardless of the percentage of the present anomalies.

AB  - Wearable technology has played an essential role in the Mobile Health (mHealth) sector for diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation of numerous diseases and disorders. One such neuro-degenerative disorder is Parkinson’s Disease (PD). It is categorized by motor symptoms that affect a patient’s motor skills and non-motor symptoms that affect the general health of a PD patient. The quality of life of a patient with PD is highly compromised. To date, there is no cure for the disease, but early intervention and assistive care can help a PD patient to perform daily activities with considerable ease. Many research works in PD management discuss the challenges that healthcare professionals face in the early detection and management of this disease. Sensor devices have been promising to overcome these challenges to a certain degree because of the low cost and accuracy in measurement, yielding precise conclusive results to detect, monitor, and manage PD. This paper presents a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) that provides an in-depth analysis of the PD symptoms, Motor and Non-Motor Symptoms (NMS), the current diagnosis and management techniques used and their efficacy. The paper also highlights the work of various researchers in wearable sensors and their proposals to improve the quality of life of a PD patient by diagnosing, monitoring, and managing PD symptoms remotely via wearable sensors. Another area of focus is commercially available wearables for PD management and a few promising works in progress. This paper will be beneficial for future researchers to identify existing gaps and provide the clinicians better insight into the disease progression, and avoid complications. This paper analyzes around 50+ articles from 2016 to 2021 and concludes that there is still much room for improvement in wearables for PD management during the research process. While much work has been attributed to PD Motor Symptom management, there is little focus on the management of PD NMS via wearable sensors. Furthermore, this paper also presents future work for PD management.

AB  - Recently, human activity recognition (HAR) has gained a lot of importance due to its wide range of applications in virtual reality, healthcare, surveillance, security, automated control systems, etc. Latest mobile phones have advanced computational capabilities along with several embedded MEMS sensors, which enable us to detect various physical activities unobtrusively. Incorporating personalized motion samples can improve the accuracy of motion detection by mobile devices or wearable devices that are tailored to the individual. Recent works have demonstrated that the use of machine learning and statistical techniques can detect human activities more accurately. In this paper, we have classified two different physical activities, viz., walking and brisk-walking using a deep neural network (DNN). The personalized data has been collected using multiple sensors of the mobile phone with the two kinds of physical activity. Using mobile phone sensors like accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, etc, data has been collected, examined, and used for training and testing the DNN model. Out of multiple sensors on the phone, we have identified the sensors which are more appropriate for the given motion/activities. Finally, we have achieved a classification accuracy of 96.5%.

Nowadays, there is a huge potential to improve the healthcare quality and customer satisfaction with the help of machine learning (ML) algorithms applied on time-domain and frequency-domain healthcare data obtained from wearables and sensors. This systematic literature review examines in depth how health data from sensors can be processed and analyzed using ML techniques. The review focuses on the following diseases for obtaining the eHealth data: diabetes mellitus type 1 and type 2, hypertension and hypotension, atrial fibrillation, bradykinesia, dyskinesia, and fever related diseases. The data for the systematic literature review was collected from four databases, Medline, Proquest, Scopus, and Web of Science. We selected 67 studies for the final in-depth review out of the initial 1530 pre-selected papers. Our study identified that the major part of eHealth data is obtained from the sensors such as accelerometer, gyroscopes, ECG (Electrocardiogram), EEG (Electroencephalogram) monitors, and blood glucose sensors. This study also examines the different feature types, feature extraction methods, and ML algorithms used for eHealth data analysis. Our review also shows that neural network (NN) algorithms and support vector machines (SVM) have shown so far the best performance for analyzing the healthcare data among other ML algorithms studied in the literature.

AB  - Effective post-operative pain management requires an accurate and frequent assessment of the pain experienced by the patients. The current gold-standard of pain assessment is through patient self-evaluation (e.g., numeric rating scale, NRS) which is subjective, prone to recall-bias, and does not provide comprehensive information of the pain intensity and its trends. We conducted a study to explore the potential of wearable biosensors and machine learning-based analysis of physiological parameters to estimate the pain intensity. The results from our study of post-operative knee surgery patients monitored over a period of 30 days demonstrate the feasibility of the system in ambulatory setting, with a substantial agreement (Cohen’s Kappa = 0.70, 95% CI 0.68-0.72) between the pain intensity estimation and the patient reported numerical rating scale. Therefore, the wearable biosensors coupled with the machine learning-derived pain estimation are capable of remotely assessing the pain intensity.

AB  - The classification of simple and complex sequences of operations is made easier according to the use of heterogeneous sensors from a wearable device. Sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) is being used in smartphone platforms for elderly healthcare monitoring, fall detection, and inappropriate behavior prevention, such as smoking habit, unhealthy eating, and lack of exercise. Common machine learning and deep learning techniques have recently been presented to tackle the HAR issue, with a focus on everyday activities, particularly general human activities including moving, sitting, and standing. However, there is an intriguing and challenging HAR research subjects involving more complicated psychological activities in various environments, including smoking, eating, and drinking. The use of heterogeneous sensor data to enhance recognition performance over sensor-based deep learning networks is considered in this work. We demonstrate that using a combination of two inertial measurement units outperforms employing either an accelerometer or a gyroscope by utilizing four deep learning classifiers to recognize complex human activity (CHA). Furthermore, we describe the impact of five window sizes (5s - 40s) on a publicly accessible benchmark dataset and how increasing window size effects to the classification performance of CHA deep learning networks.

AB  - Nowadays, ubiquitous healthcare monitoring applications are becoming a necessity. In a pervasive smart healthcare system, the user's location information is always transmitted periodically to healthcare providers to increase the quality of the service provided to the user. However, revealing the user's location will affect the user's privacy. This paper presents a novel cloud-based secure location privacy-preserving mobile healthcare framework with decision-making capabilities. A user's vital signs are sensed possibly through a wearable healthcare device and transmitted to a cloud server for securely storing user's data, processing, and decision making. The proposed framework integrates a number of features such as machine learning (ML) for classifying a user's health state, and crowdsensing for collecting information about a person's privacy preferences for possible locations and applying such information to a user who did not set his privacy preferences. In addition to location privacy preservation methods (LPPM) such as obfuscation, perturbation and encryption to protect the location of the user and provide a secure monitoring framework. The proposed framework detects clear emergency cases and quickly decides about sending a help message to a healthcare provider before sending data to the cloud server. To validate the efficiency of the proposed framework, a prototype is developed and tested. The obtained results from the proposed prototype prove its feasibility and utility. Compared to the state of art, the proposed framework offers an adaptive context-based decision for location sharing privacy and controlling the trade-off between location privacy and service utility.

AB  - New applications like activity tracking and healthcare monitoring depend on secure and timely data transfer using wearable sensors. This work aims to reduce data loss and latency when transmitting wearable sensor information to analysis terminals by introducing an innovative probabilistic transfer learning approach. Using dynamic transmission slot allocation based on risk thresholds and time sensitivity, the suggested method intelligently arranges and prioritizes the transfer of aggregate sensor data across various sources. High-risk data is given preference when allocating slots in a two-step algorithm that divides the data into emergency and normal classifications to guarantee timely delivery without undue delays. Over time, for better activity identification, the transfer model of learning steadily learns and improves the slot assignment accuracy based on feedback. Comprehensive analysis of various queuing scenarios and transmission disruptions shows notable improvements over existing approaches, with waiting times, data loss, and transmission delays reduced by up to 10.49%, 2.42%, and 13.86%, respectively. Most importantly, 3.28% more accuracy is achieved in identifying distinct activities from the supplied wearable sensor data. This can be achieved by the dependable data supply by the probabilistic modelling approach. With its comprehensive architecture for efficiently managing limited communication resources, the suggested approach can provide real-time health surveillance, smart environment services, and other digital-physical systems requiring trustworthy data streaming. More interaction with statistical engines, improvements to security and privacy, and scalability validation on larger distributed platforms are possible areas for future work.

AB  - Medical Internet of Things technology can effectively enable remote physiological data collection, monitoring, and transmission by integrating flexible sensors, wireless communication, and the human body in a wearable and embedded manner. Herein, a stretchable elastomer optical fiber has been developed and sandwiched with two performance of polymethyl methacrylate optical fibers to form a fully flexible polymer optical fiber sensor. The optical fiber integrated with the system mainly consists of a microcomputer, a light-emitting diode (LED) driver, a LED light source, a photodiode, and a Bluetooth module. One intelligent wearable photonic sensing system has been developed based on the Beer–Lambert law of the stretchable elastomer optical fiber for remote healthcare monitoring. Benefiting from the use of elastomer polymer materials, the sensing system features a maximum strain of more than 250%, a high-tensile strain of up to 100%, and a durability of >500 tests. Also, based on the advantage of elastomer optical fiber, the sensing part can be flexibly pasted on the skin surface as a wearable device for real-time monitoring of multiple physiological parameters. In this study, we successfully realized the monitoring of breathing pattern, heart rate, pulse, facial micro-activity, and joint activity, and the recognition of articulatory activity and knee joint activity using a 1-D convolutional neural network, with an accuracy of more than 90% for each activity recognition. Such merits demonstrate its potential as a medical toolkit and indicate promise for remote healthcare monitoring.

AB  - Wearable sensor technology is the new and upcoming revolution in next-generation IoT solutions that will enable efficient and more reliable healthcare monitoring. The primary goal of wearable sensor technology is to collect and instantly transmit a patient's health-related data. For real-time health monitoring of critical patients, data of varying sizes must be transferred quickly, effectively, and in a prioritized manner. In this paper, we focus on prioritizing the data captured by various wearable devices, equipped by the patients. The data captured and generated in such cases will be heterogeneous in nature and transmitted at different rates. The prioritization is done on the MAC layer by varying the back-off time experienced by data of various priorities. We have given higher priority data lesser backoff time intervals compared to lower priority data, thus transferring it faster and reducing its latency. As wearable sensors have power, memory, and other resource constraints, Routing protocol for low power and lossy Network (RPL) is the best-suited routing protocol for such networks. The introduction of Mobility in this research incorporates the real-time movements of patients wearing the sensors, which simulates a more realistic scenario for this study.

AB  - Due to the breadth of its application domains, Hu-man Activity Recognition (HAR) is a problematic area of human-computer interaction. HAR can be used in remote monitoring of senior healthcare and concern situations in intelligent man-ufacturing, among other applications. HAR based on wearable inertial sensors has been researched identification efficiency in various kinds of human actions considerably more than vision-based HAR. The sensor-based HAR is generally applicable to indoor and outdoor locations without privacy considerations of implementation. In this research, we explore the recognition performance of multiple deep learning (DL) models to recognize everyday living human activities. We developed a deep residual neural network that employed aggregated multi-branch transformation to boost identification performance. The proposed model is called the ResNeXt model. To evaluate its performance, three standard DL models (CNN, LSTM, and CNN-LSTM) are investigated and compared to our proposed model using a standard HAR dataset called Daily Living Activity dataset. These datasets gathered mobility signal data from multimodal sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer) in three distinct body areas (wrist, hip, and ankle). The experimental findings reveal that the proposed model surpasses other benchmark DL models with maximum accuracy and F1-scores. Furthermore, the findings show that the ResNeXt model is more resistant than other models with fewer training parameters.

AB  - As the population of the elderly in the world continues its rapid surge, more attention must be drawn towards remote health monitoring (RHM), early diagnosis, and preventive interventions to sustain health care and eldercare. Elderly gait is a sensitive marker for their health status which enables detection of physical and mental impairments. This study aimed to advance the performance of elderly gait event detection using a single waist-worn IMU sensor through deep learning models. Four deep learning models MLP, CNN, LSTM, and GRU were trained and tested on data from the community-dwelling elderly. The accuracy was measured for six detection delay tolerance ranges. The GRU model achieved the best accuracy of 99.47% at a detection delay tolerance range of ±6TS (±6ms) and 78.98% for a more precise range of ±1TS (±1ms). The proposed method showed significant improvement over previously reported event detection results by achieving an MAE of 8.9ms and 7.6ms for the HS and TO events respectively. The RNN models attained better accuracy for the TO events as compared to HS events. Furthermore, an ablation study was also performed to observe the contribution of the subsets of the six IMU signals from the pelvis to the overall performance of the best model. The study showed that deep learning-based methods are much superior to previously reported methods for gait event detection through the pelvis sensor and it is expected to bring new attention towards practical waist-worn wearable devices for the health and condition monitoring of the elderly.

AB  - The mental and physical health of an individual may be monitored using such a device. Many different types of illness may be traced back to stress, anxiety, and high blood pressure. Anxiety, stress, and pressure are all common among the elderly and need specialized care in this situation. Artifact identification for BP and PPG data was developed in this work and is now fully automated. It was suggested that the vital signs signal be processed in such a way that any anomalies caused by motion artefacts be removed automatically. Then, the systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure connection was analyzed using eleven characteristics extracted from the oscillometric waveforms envelope. The blood pressure estimation technique suggested in this work has been shown to be accurate. The suggested design takes use of sophisticated regression to estimate the patient's diastolic and systolic levels of pressure from the parameters of the PPG signal.

AB  - Objective: Exercise monitoring with low-cost wearables could improve the efficacy of remote physical-therapy prescriptions by tracking compliance and informing the delivery of tailored feedback. While a multitude of commercial wearables can detect activities of daily life, such as walking and running, they cannot accurately detect physical-therapy exercises. The goal of this study was to build open-source classifiers for remote physical-therapy monitoring and provide insight on how data collection choices may impact classifier performance. Methods: We trained and evaluated multi-class classifiers using data from 19 healthy adults who performed 37 exercises while wearing 10 inertial measurement units (IMUs) on the chest, pelvis, wrists, thighs, shanks, and feet. We investigated the effect of sensor density, location, type, sampling frequency, output granularity, feature engineering, and training-data size on exercise-classification performance. Results: Exercise groups (n = 10) could be classified with 96% accuracy using a set of 10 IMUs and with 89% accuracy using a single pelvis-worn IMU. Multiple sensor modalities (i.e., accelerometers and gyroscopes), high sampling frequencies, and more data from the same population did not improve model performance, but in the future data from diverse populations and better feature engineering could. Conclusions: Given the growing demand for exercise monitoring systems, our sensitivity analyses, along with open-source tools and data, should reduce barriers for product developers, who are balancing accuracy with product formfactor, and increase transparency and trust in clinicians and patients.

AB  - Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM), which leverages the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) and autonomous systems, has grown in popularity recently. In RPM, the IoMT sense a patient’s biophysical data and transmits it in real time while the autonomous system processes the data for clinical notifications and storage. However, RPM deployments face two diverse challenges: how to present continuous data so that healthcare professionals can quickly interpret data streams and how to manage a great deal of missing data that occurs in RPM. Several studies suggested techniques for imputing missing data in static databases, which are unsuitable for RPM. A method for constantly streaming healthcare data to medical experts involves summarizing vital signs information into a numerical score, such as the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS), which may be visually displayed to highlight MEWS patterns over a certain period. However, a MEWS chart is simplistic and more sophisticated ways to present data visually for straightforward interpretation are needed. This research proposes a solution for the visualization and missing data challenges by identifying patterns in the RPM data. First, a pattern-matching technique is proposed to address the missing data by considering the correlation and variability of the vital signs, resulting in a comparable correct match rate. Second, we transform the observed raw physiological vital signs data into concepts we call trust, frequency, trend, and slope parameters for visualization and automated alerts. The proposed approach can better support clinical decision-making than the MEWS. Comprehensive visualization approaches and missing data solutions can improve the quality and dependability of patient risk assessments.

AB  - Wearable sensors and social networking sites help gather participant information for healthcare monitoring. Wearable sensors generate a lot of healthcare data for continuous patient monitoring. Social networking sites' user-generated healthcare data is huge and unstructured. Existing healthcare monitoring systems have trouble gathering and evaluating sensor and social network data, and traditional machine learning methods are insufficient to anticipate abnormalities in big healthcare data. A novel cloud-based healthcare monitoring architecture is presented to properly save and evaluate healthcare data and increase classification results. A Wireless Sensor Network and Big Data Analytics based Intelligent Health Monitoring System (IHMS) is suggested in this paper. The suggested large data analytics engine uses data mining, ontologies, and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM). Data processing approaches preprocess information and minimize dimensionality. Proposed ontologies give semantic information about diabetes and blood pressure entities, aspects, and relationships (BP). Bi-LSTM categorizes information properly to forecast medication side effects and patient abnormalities. The suggested approach defines patients' health using diabetes, BP, mental health, and medicine reviews, and this model uses Java and Protégé Web Ontology Language. The findings demonstrate that the suggested system accurately manages healthcare information and predicts pharmacological side effects.

AB  - It’s absurd for a clinical master to monitor a patient’s pulse and body temperature all the time from a remote location using standard monitoring equipment. As a solution to this problem, we may develop an Internet of Things-based framework that makes use of a microcontroller and a user-friendly temperature sensor known as the DS18B20 (which is a kind of temperature sensor that provides 9-bit to 12-bit measurements of temperature). An emerging concept of a linked e-health system that includes Personal Health Devices has emerged due to recent advances in consumer electronics and rising healthcare expenditures. It was found that incorporating ICT into the healthcare sector may help maximize the availability of all medical resources while also providing dependable, efficient care for the elderly and those with physical impairments or long-term sickness. This article sheds some insight on the currently available methods for Internet of Things-based healthcare applications. An IoT-based healthcare system using Pattern Matching Algorithm is presented which gathers patient data from different sensors and sends messages alerting the caregiver and doctor in real time. It keeps track of the patient’s physiological characteristics from a distance and makes early diagnoses of illness. Using a Wireless Body Area Network, this may be integrated into a wearable alert system. The suggested solution’s network overhead and appropriateness for various settings are discussed, including how different wireless interfaces integrate with a cloud service.

AB  - Covid-19 is one of the life-threatening diseases which requires intensifying attention to combat disease by designing a smart and effective healthcare system for patients towards diagnosing and managing the Covid-19 disease. Various systems have been developed for diagnosing patient with diseases, but intelligent and feasible solution to explore and monitor the accurate predictive health conditions of affected patients has not been provided yet. In this paper, a new Contactless IoT-enabled cloud-assisted health monitoring system has been designed and developed. The system is made up of unobtrusive sensors, a data acquisition unit, a microcontroller, wi-fi Module, Web server, and Web application or mobile application. It illustrates the design of the system to monitor and detect the severity of the coronavirus in the patients using various unobtrusive sensors to measure disease-specific vital parameters such as heart rate, temperature, oxygen level and pulse rate as main symptoms of the coronavirus are high fever, fatigue, and difficult breathing. Sensor acquired patient data is transformed using the HTTP protocol to cloud server using microcontroller and wi-fi module in real-time. Transformed data of patient condition is processed in the cloud server using data predictive algorithms such as Severity Defined Convolution Neural Network with respect to data collected and severity specific data thresholds and severity class predicted patient information will alarm the healthcare provider on the abnormalities detected in the patient health. A particular model is capable of forecasting the health situation of the patients. Experimental analysis of the proposed architectures finds it effective in monitoring the status of the severity of breathing on the patients. Finally, the performance of the architecture is validated over accuracy and scalability measures.

AB  - ICU readmission is usually associated with an increased number of hospital death. Predicting readmission helps to reduce such risks by avoiding early discharge, providing appropriate intervention, and planning for patient placement after ICU discharge. Unfortunately, ICU scores such as the simplified acute physiology score (SAPS) and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health (APACHE) could help predict mortality or evaluate illness severity. Still, it is ineffective in predicting ICU readmission. This study introduces a clinical monitoring fog-computing-based system for remote prognosis and monitoring of intensive care patients. This proposed monitoring system uses the advantages of machine learning (ML) approaches for generating a real-time alert signal to doctors for supplying e-healthcare, accelerating decision-making, and monitoring and controlling health systems. The proposed system includes three main layers. First, the data acquisition layer, in which we collect the vital signs and lab tests of the patient’s health conditions in real-time. Then, the fog computing layer processes. The results are then sent to the cloud layer, which offers sizable storage space for patient healthcare. Demographic data, lab tests, and vital signs are aggregated from the MIMIC III dataset for 10,465 patients. Feature selection methods: Genetic algorithm (GA) and practical swarm optimization (PSO) are used to choose the optimal feature subset from detests. Moreover, Different traditional ML models, ensemble learning models, and the proposed stacking models are applied to full features and selected features to predict readmission after 30 days of ICU discharge. The proposed stacking models recorded the highest performance compared to other models. The proposed stacking ensemble model with selected features by POS achieved promising results (accuracy = 98.42, precision = 98.42, recall = 98.42, and F1-Score = 98.42), compared to full features and selected features. We also, provide model explanations to ensure efficiency, effectiveness, and trust in the developed model through local and global explanations.

AB  - The early detection of renal cancer recurrence plays a critical role in improving patient outcomes and quality of life. In this study, we propose a novel approach for an Early Warning System for Renal Cancer Recurrence leveraging wearable IoT devices, smartphone integration, cloud-based data processing, and advanced machine learning and deep learning algorithms. Specifically, we employ a range of wearable sensors, including pulse oximeters, blood pressure monitors, temperature sensors, and activity trackers, to capture relevant physiological parameters associated with renal cancer recurrence. Optional implantable sensors, such as glucose monitors and biomarker sensors, are also considered for enhanced monitoring capabilities. Smartphone integration serves as a central hub for data aggregation, enabling real-time monitoring, alerts, and feedback mechanisms for both patients and healthcare providers through mobile applications. Sensor data is securely transmitted to cloud-based platforms for centralized storage and processing, where data fusion techniques are implemented to integrate sensor data with electronic health records (EHR), imaging data, and other clinical information for comprehensive analysis. Machine learning and deep learning algorithms are developed and trained on integrated datasets to detect patterns indicative of renal cancer recurrence, analyzing multi-modal data sources to identify subtle indicators of recurrence. Finally, a real-time alerting system is implemented to trigger notifications to healthcare providers when abnormal patterns or deviations from baseline are detected, enabling timely intervention and proactive management strategies. This comprehensive Early Warning System enables continuous monitoring, early detection of abnormalities, and personalized interventions, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes and quality of care in the management of renal cancer recurrence.

The latter refers to the network of interconnected medical devices, wearable gadgets, sensors, and equipment that can collect, transmit, and share medical data and information via the internet. On the other hand, Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a transformative technology in the healthcare sector, revolutionizing how medical data is analyzed and utilized. Multiple applications of ML in healthcare have been deeply analyzed and discussed such as the enhancement of disease diagnosis, treatment optimization, and surgical operations. Nonetheless, the insights gained by these trained ML models remain confined to the data collected within the immediate environment and the distinct characteristics of each patient's context. Furthermore, the reluctance to share these models securely with external systems and entities hinders the progression of such solutions toward a broader, more accurate, and resilient framework. Therefore, in this paper, a special focus is given to specific field of ML which is Federated Learning (FL). The main objective is to discuss the potential of to sharing already trained ML models across multiple entities for a better health issues detection. Such trained models already contains knowledge that can be directly used by other entities to either detect an already known health issues or new ones. Thus, this paper presents a comprehensive study on the synergistic utilization of these technologies to share medical knowledge while addressing privacy concerns and enable personalized healthcare solutions. We explore the theoretical foundations and potential applications of integrating Federated Learning and 10MT in remote monitoring.

AB  - Recent trends in the healthcare industry, such as the use of wearable IoT for continuous health monitoring, are setting new requirements for healthcare systems that boost data analysis. These systems should support decentralization and maintain the privacy and ownership of users' data due to the sensitivity of healthcare data. Therefore, the use of federated learning techniques is recommended for systems that need such requirements. This paper proposes a Deep Federated Learning framework for decentralized healthcare systems that maintain user privacy in a distributed architecture. It also proposes an algorithm for an automated training data acquiring process. Furthermore, it presents an experiment for using deep federated learning in detecting skin diseases and using Transfer Learning to address the problem of limited availability of healthcare data in building deep learning models. The evaluated results show how the federated learning increased the Area Under the Curve of the centralized learning model up to 0.97, as it also shows good model performance during federated rounds in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Moreover, although the FL system has affected the quality of service to the user in terms of model conversion time, the Federated Learning system meets the requirements of building models in a decentralized manner with no sharing of users' private data.

AB  - Epilepsy is a prevalent neurological illness that affects an estimated 70 million people across the world. Seizures must be tracked if epilepsy is to be monitored and treated effectively. Caretaker seizure diaries are used for current epilepsy treatment; nevertheless, the use of clinical seizure detection may overlook episodes. In the long run, wearable gadgets may be more comfortable and easier to use for ambulatory monitoring. Custom-built machine learning (ML) algorithms are evaluated for the ability to identify seizures across a wide range of epileptic episodes using wrist and ankle-worn biosensors. In this paper, an automated technique a new wireless sensor based system is developed for detecting and monitoring epileptic patients in a non-clinical environment and to reduce the amount of time neurologists spend diagnosing seizures. Here a mechanism was developed for capturing multi-modal data such as Electroencephalogram (EEG) using wrist-worn biosensor. But exclusion of noise and feature extraction are two major encounters for forecasting of epileptic seizures. In order to detect epileptic seizure in a shorter period of time, statistical values and Lyapunov features were obtained, instead of raw data utilizing Support Vector Machine (SVM) as a classifier and obtained a substantial enhancement over the state-of-the-art methods.

AB  - With the emergence of wearable technology, IoT, and Edge computing, the nature of healthcare is rapidly shifting towards digital health aided by these ICT technologies. At the same time, consumer devices, such as smart, wearable fitness watches are gaining market share as a way to monitor physical activity and wellness. Despite these advances, and their ability to capture longitudinal behavioural patterns, these devices have yet to be fully leveraged within the healthcare system. If the user-generated data from such devices could be collected without com-promising an individual’s privacy, these insights could comprise part of a more holistic and preventative healthcare solution. In this article, we propose an Edge-assisted data analytics frame-work that uses Federated Learning to re-train local machine learning models using user-generated data. This framework could leverage pre-trained models to extract user-customized insights while preserving privacy and Cloud resources. We also identify some potential application scenarios and discuss research challenges to be explored within the proposed framework.

AB  - Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition where dopaminergic medication, such as levodopa, is typically used to improve motor symptoms, including mobility. Identifying the impact of levodopa on real-world motor state (e.g. ON/OFF/ DYSKINESIA) is important for both clinicians and people with PD. The aim of the present work was to automatically classify medication states using machine learning models. Continuous 7-day data were collected in 26 people with PD using an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) placed on the fifth lumbar vertebrae (L5) level. Over the week, each participant was asked to complete a diary by annotating medication states (off-condition and dyskinesias) with a 30-minute resolution. Diary entries were used as reference labels assigned to the processed IMU data. Two different networks were chosen for the classification: the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm (kNN) to identify ON-OFF-DYSKINESIA classes and Fine Tree (FT) to identify only OFF and ON classes. Preliminary results demonstrate that IMU data paired with machine learning could accurately classify ON-OFF and DYSKINESIA with 84% accuracy and the ON-OFF states were classified with 95% accuracy. These results are encouraging and pave the way to a better understanding of the effect that medication has on motor symptoms in PD during everyday life and may serve as a useful tool for optimizing clinical management of people with PD.

AB  - Smartwatches are becoming more popular for recognizing and monitoring human actions in everyday life. These wearable devices are equipped with various IMU sensors for ubiquitous data processing and recording of human physical activity data. Sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) has risen to the top of the list of the most active research topic due to its widely real-life applications in various practical domains, such as healthcare monitoring, sports and exercise tracking, and misbehavior prevention. Many machine learning and deep learning approaches have been recently proposed to solve the problem of human activity recognition, focusing on activities of daily living. However, an exciting and challenging HAR topic deals with more complex human activities such as eating-related activities. This paper proposes a sensor-based HAR framework using data from eating-related activities recorded by a smartwatch sensor. In this framework, five d eep learning networks (CNN, LSTM, BiLSTM, Stacked LSTM, CNN-LSTM, and LSTM-CNN) are evaluated for their recognition of eating-related activities. To ensure the model’s dependability, data from eating-related activities on the standard publicly available dataset WISDM-HARB are utilized to evaluate the proposed framework using state-of-the-art metrics: accuracy and confusion matrices. Experiment findings demonstrate that the S tacked LSTM model outperforms other deep learning models, achieving an accuracy of 97.37%.

AB  - Remote healthcare and telemedicine technology have witnessed a large and rapid development in the last decade with the large development of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology, where various types of medical sensors are aggregated for measuring medical parameters and transmitting them anywhere. Smart portable products can now be used to monitor different medical aspects to track human health. Also, they can be used in the prediagnosis of various diseases and in detecting abnormalities of organ functionality. In this article, we design and implement a multifunction and portable health monitoring system, which can help in daily medical inspections. The developed system monitors various medical aspects: heart rate (HR), blood oxygen saturation level (SpO2), body temperature, photoplethysmography (PPG) signal, electrocardiography (ECG) signal, room temperature, and room humidity. The obtained measurements are displayed on the built-in display or transmitted over Wi-Fi to either a mobile application, in the local mode, or to the cloud storage for remote monitoring. The developed system can be used to keep an eye on the people we need to care about, while keeping them in their normal daily life. The maximum error percentage of the proposed system is reported as 2.67%, 2.04%, and 1.58% for HR, SpO2, and body temperature, respectively, compared to commercial devices. In addition, statistical tests were performed and they showed a high level of agreement between the observed and the reference measurements. The results indicate the high accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed system to be used in daily medical applications.

AB  - Smart textile paves the way to a new generation of wearable electronics of Internet of Things (IoTs). However, the battery-dependent and hygroscopic limitations restrict the practical applications of self-powered textile-based electronics. To solve these problems, here we report a superhydrophobic textile based TENG using a facile coating approach to assemble CNTs/TPE onto textile. With improved anti-humidity and quick recovery capabilities from high moisture environment, the functionalized textile based-TENG enables relatively efficient biomechanical energy harvesting, anti-sweat human motion monitoring, especially gesture recognition of words of sign language based on superhydrophobic glove interface by using deep learning technology, maintaining high recognition accuracy even in high humidity atmosphere.

AB  - The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), combined with interconnected wearable devices and medical-grade sensors, can play an essential role in healthcare evolution. By exploiting the data generated by the plethora of interconnected devices (vital parameters, location-based info, patients activity and more), advanced ICT systems can be put in place with predicting capabilities. This way potentially critical situations, that may evolve in serious complications to patients’ well-being, can be promptly recognized and successfully addressed, first of all, to save lives and secondarily to limit economical damages. To support continuous patient monitoring in public and private healthcare, this paper proposes "DILoCC", an architecture to manage wearable devices, sensors and applications, that uses a Distributed Incremental Learning (DIL) approach to exploit cooperation among the sensing devices and increase the overall system efficiency through the mitigation of "Catastrophic Forgetting" consequences.

AB  - Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors integrated in wearable devices offer the potential to monitor arterial blood pressure (ABP) in patients. Such cuffless, non-invasive, and continuous solution is suitable for remote and ambulatory monitoring. A machine learning model based on PPG signal can be used to detect hypertension, estimate beat-by-beat ABP values, and even reconstruct the shape of the ABP. Overall, models presented in literature have shown good performance, but there is a gap between research and potential real-world use cases. Usually, models are trained and tested on data from the same dataset and same subjects, which may lead to overestimating their accuracy. In this paper: we compare cross-validation, where the test data are from the same dataset as training data, and external validation, where the model is tested on samples from a new dataset, on a regression model which predicts diastolic blood pressure from PPG features. The results show that, in the cross-validation, the predicted and the real values are linearly dependent, while in the external validation, the predicted values are not related to the real ones, but probably just through an average value.

AB  - Information is a resource in our advanced world; a huge amount of information has been produced in numerous areas. Wellbeing industry information incorporates data from patients and data connected to infection. This clinical information and AI innovation will help us break down much information to find personal examples of the illness, furnish the patient with customized treatment, and foresee the condition. Articulation recognition plays a vital role in deciding the patient's medical services framework status. It empowers reconnaissance groups to answer crises rapidly. Variances normally impact existing strategies and result in a limited climate in the patient's image of the patient's stance, size, impediment, and lighting. A new method-based local binary patterns (LBP) feature extraction approach is presented for studying human behaviour using facial expression recognition. Picture portrayal is encoded utilizing these descriptors from nearby fixed measurements. This article evaluates several classification approaches for choice help and human well-being checking frameworks. The paper expects to investigate a few order techniques for sorting wearable information in observing different sicknesses. Coded pictures are changed into a recurrence space utilizing a discrete cosine Transformation (DCT). Support Vector Machine (SVM), repetitive brain organization (RNN), and Innocent Bayes (NB) are being used to order and perceive looks utilizing explicit qualities. Comprehensive testing is done with standard datasets to inspect human behaviour. Results show that the system proposed is better than the other relative techniques.

AB  - Over the years, the popularity and usage of wearable Internet of Things (IoT) devices in several healthcare services are increased. Among the services that benefit from the usage of such devices is predictive analysis, which can improve early diagnosis in e-health. However, due to the limitations of wearable IoT devices, challenges in data privacy, service integrity, and network structure adaptability arose. To address these concerns, we propose a platform using federated learning and private blockchain technology within a fog-IoT network. These technologies have privacy-preserving features securing data within the network. We utilized the fog-IoT network’s distributive structure to create an adaptive network for wearable IoT devices. We designed a testbed to examine the proposed platform’s ability to preserve the integrity of a classifier. According to experimental results, the introduced implementation can effectively preserve a patient’s privacy and a predictive service’s integrity. We further investigated the contributions of other technologies to the security and adaptability of the IoT network. Overall, we proved the feasibility of our platform in addressing significant security and privacy challenges of wearable IoT devices in predictive healthcare through analysis, simulation, and experimentation.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) is considered a serious public health problem due to the uncertainty of its onset. Consuming wearable devices have increasing popularities for healthcare monitoring, and many of them are capable of continuous monitoring and early detection of CVDs. This paper proposes a framework for heart sound detection that can be considered for deployment on smart wearable devices to screen CVDs conveniently. A dual-stream convolutional neural network (DS-CNN) is developed to detect abnormal ones from short-term heart sound recordings. Preprocessing module is first employed for noise filtering and amplitude normalization. Then short-time Fourier transform and higher-order spectral are introduced for feature extraction, whose products are subsequently fed into the DS-CNN for screening abnormal heart sound signals. Two open accessible datasets are employed for performance evaluation. The results well demonstrate the classification accuracy of the proposed DS-CNN, and also indicate its advantages for adapting to heart sound recordings collected by different equipments.
