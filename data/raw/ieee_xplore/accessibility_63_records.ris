AB  - Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is an intriguing approach to healthcare monitoring that necessitates the ongoing utilization of wearable sensors to capture everyday activities. The most advanced studies using wearable devices have used a cloud computing paradigm that categorized data at remote systems. This method has drawbacks in terms of energy consumption, latency, and privacy. As a result, we adhere to a low-power computing structure in which wearable device solutions achieve an acceptable level of performance while being energy and memory-efficient. This study proposes a lightweight deep learning model termed a gate recurrent unit (GRU) network for energy-efficient HAR appropriate for low-power wearable devices. The introduced GRU network is evaluated against a benchmark dataset named the w-HAR dataset, including essential deep learning networks. The proposed GRU surpasses baseline deep learning networks in terms of overall accuracy, with a score of 95.160%.

AB  - Recently, during the COVID-19 situation, the requirement and importance of tracking patients from a remote location have increased significantly. Most patients now prefer to obtain their doctor’s care and check their health status through their mobile phone call, Skype, Facebook Messenger, or other online resources. There is, however, a major concern about the privacy of patients when using online resources. Patients usually choose to keep their information confidential, which should be only accessible to authorized individuals. The most current remote patient monitoring system is organization-centric and patient’s privacy and security rely on healthcare providers’ mercy. Blockchain technologies have attracted the attention of researchers for designing eHealth applications to provide patients with secure and privacy-preserving health services. Blockchain researchers have recently proposed some models for remote patient monitoring systems. However, most of those researchers have applied public blockchains where health data is available to all participants with the property of data tamper-proof. In this paper, we propose a novel remote patient monitoring model using a decentralized private blockchain to protect patient’s privacy and increase the system’s efficiency. The private blockchain will be implemented on Hyperledger Fabric where a Patient-centric Agents (PCA) manage patient’s data and coordinate authorization to form a secure channel to transmit data to the private blockchain. A hybrid consensus by combining Proof of Integrity (PoI) and Proof of Validity (PoV) is used to protect data privacy and integrity when retrieving data from a blockchain-based cloud database. Finally, the Merkle Tree algorithm was used for data processing and authentication when collecting data and uploading it to a cloud database.

AB  - Knee health assessment is crucial in reducing the risk of knee injuries, which can have a significant impact on individuals of all ages and activity levels. Knee acoustic emissions (KAEs) have emerged as a promising bio-signal for assessing knee health, which can be recorded using a wide-band microphone. However, the monitoring of KAE has been dependent on expensive and bulky systems, limiting the accessibility and scalability of the technology for a large population. In this work, we introduce a low-cost small form-factor wireless wearable knee monitoring system (KneeMS), capable of recording KAEs. The frequency response of KneeMS was evaluated through spectral density (PSD) comparison against a previously validated benchtop system. A Pearson’s r = 0.99 was achieved for PSD comparison between the sine sweep response of KneeMS and the benchtop system. A human participant study was conducted to validate the system’s performance in the context of KAEs, showing that KneeMS performs comparably to the benchtop system in joint loading experiments. The study achieved a Pearson’s r = 0.96 for root mean square (RMS) amplitude comparison between KneeMS and benchtop system. Moreover, the study showed that KneeMS exhibits an RMS ratio behavior similar to the benchtop for different joint loading conditions. Thus, KneeMS offers a more efficient, scalable, and accessible solution for measuring KAEs. The system’s portability and wireless connectivity enables continuous monitoring of KAEs, offering a solution for remote and longitunal monitoring for future studies on the use of KAEs for knee health monitoring.

AB  - Breast cancer related lymphedema (BCRL) is a common, debilitating condition that can affect up to one in five breast cancer surviving patients (BCSP). BCRL can significantly reduce the quality of life (QOL) of patients and poses a significant challenge to healthcare providers. Early detection and continuous monitoring of lymphedema is crucial for the development of client-centered treatment plans for post-cancer surgery patients. Therefore, this comprehensive scoping review aimed to investigate the current technology methods used for the remote monitoring of BCRL and their potential to facilitate telehealth in the treatment of lymphedema. Initially, five electronic databases were systematically searched and analyzed following the PRISMA flow diagram. Studies were included, specifically if they provided data on the effectiveness of the intervention and were designed for the remote monitoring of BCRL. A total of 25 included studies reported 18 technological solutions to remotely monitor BCRL with significant methodological variation. Additionally, the technologies were categorized by method of detection and wearability. The findings of this comprehensive scoping review indicate that state-of-the-art commercial technologies were found to be more appropriate for clinical use than home monitoring, with portable 3D imaging tools being popular (SD 53.40) and accurate (correlation $>$ 0.9, p $<$ 0.05) for evaluating lymphedema in both clinic and home settings with expert practitioners and therapists. However, wearable technologies showed the most future potential for accessible and clinical long-term lymphedema management with positive telehealth outcomes. In conclusion, the absence of a viable telehealth device highlights the need for urgent research to develop a wearable device that can effectively track BCRL and facilitate remote monitoring, ultimately improving the quality of life for patients following post-cancer treatment.

AB  - The classification of simple and complex sequences of operations is made easier according to the use of heterogeneous sensors from a wearable device. Sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) is being used in smartphone platforms for elderly healthcare monitoring, fall detection, and inappropriate behavior prevention, such as smoking habit, unhealthy eating, and lack of exercise. Common machine learning and deep learning techniques have recently been presented to tackle the HAR issue, with a focus on everyday activities, particularly general human activities including moving, sitting, and standing. However, there is an intriguing and challenging HAR research subjects involving more complicated psychological activities in various environments, including smoking, eating, and drinking. The use of heterogeneous sensor data to enhance recognition performance over sensor-based deep learning networks is considered in this work. We demonstrate that using a combination of two inertial measurement units outperforms employing either an accelerometer or a gyroscope by utilizing four deep learning classifiers to recognize complex human activity (CHA). Furthermore, we describe the impact of five window sizes (5s - 40s) on a publicly accessible benchmark dataset and how increasing window size effects to the classification performance of CHA deep learning networks.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) is considered a serious public health problem due to the uncertainty of its onset. Consuming wearable devices have increasing popularities for healthcare monitoring, and many of them are capable of continuous monitoring and early detection of CVDs. This paper proposes a framework for heart sound detection that can be considered for deployment on smart wearable devices to screen CVDs conveniently. A dual-stream convolutional neural network (DS-CNN) is developed to detect abnormal ones from short-term heart sound recordings. Preprocessing module is first employed for noise filtering and amplitude normalization. Then short-time Fourier transform and higher-order spectral are introduced for feature extraction, whose products are subsequently fed into the DS-CNN for screening abnormal heart sound signals. Two open accessible datasets are employed for performance evaluation. The results well demonstrate the classification accuracy of the proposed DS-CNN, and also indicate its advantages for adapting to heart sound recordings collected by different equipments.

AB  - This paper outlines the development of a wearable device to measure knee joint flexion angles and compares its performance to a computer vision based human pose model. The objective is to advance techniques used in measuring joint flexion angles, which have several drawbacks such as relying heavily on the clinician for accuracy while also being invasive as they require physical contact between the patient and orthopaedic specialist. The proposed implementations integrate digital innovation in orthopaedic healthcare while being affordable and easy to deploy, making them marketable to clinicians and patients in developing countries. To evaluate the workability of the implementations, knee flexion angle measurements of a test subject were obtained using both techniques which yielded consistent and comparable flexion angle readings. Further development of this work can have a significant impact on the accessibility and affordability of innovative healthcare monitoring technologies, especially for patients in developing countries.

Existing systems are mostly fall detection based on wearable devices, which can be uncomfortable to wear or ambient devices such as cameras that invade privacy. A bed falls prediction system using force sensitive resistors (FSR) has been proposed in this paper. It is designed to eliminate privacy intrusion and discomfort issues. The system can identify the patient's different on-bed positions and determine the possibility of bed falls. In case of any risky position, the caretaker will be alerted to mobile applications via the Internet of Things (IoT), making patient monitoring more accessible and manageable. This integrated system yields an average of 92% accuracy for 5 different on-bed positions. The bed fall prediction system will facilitate caretakers/nurses to take care conveniently at homes, hospitals and assisted care facilities to ensure patients' health and safety.

AB  - IoT(Internet of Things) devices are very useful tools for health monitoring, telehealth and teleconsultation. They bring a very positive added value to the different modes of health intervention. Health is one of the most valuable aspects of our lives. In some countries, especially in developing countries, health facilities are not sufficiently developed to meet the needs of the population for primary health care and emergency response. Therefore, there is a need to replace these gaps with IoT devices that will fill the medical deserts. For this reason, in this article, a general review of the literature on IoT devices for health is done. It results in a proposal for a new type of intelligent medical device to assist patients and health workers equipped with sensors for the automatic collection of patients' physiological data in order to make medical consultation more easily accessible to all and at a distance and, on the other hand, to alleviate the shortage of health workers and, moreover, to free doctors from the repetitive tasks they perform at each examination so that they can concentrate on the care to be administered and the psychological care of patients.

AB  - Telemonitoring is a branch of telehealth that aims at remotely monitoring vital signs, which is important for chronically ill patients and the elderly living alone. The available standalone devices and applications for the self-monitoring of health parameters largely suffer from interoperability problems; meanwhile, telemonitoring medical devices are expensive, self-contained, and are not integrated into user-friendly technological platforms for the end user. This paper presents the technical aspects and usability assessment of the telemonitoring features of the HEREiAM platform, which supports heterogeneous information technology systems. By exploiting a service-oriented architecture, the measured parameters collected by off-the-shelf Bluetooth medical devices are sent as XML documents to a private cloud that implements an interoperable health service infrastructure, which is compliant with the most recent healthcare standards and security protocols. This Android-based system is designed to be accessible both via TV and portable devices, and includes other utilities designed to support the elderly living alone. Four usability assessment sessions with quality-validated questionnaires were performed to accurately understand the ease of use, usefulness, acceptance, and quality of the proposed system. The results reveal that our system achieved very high usability scores even at its first use, and the scores did not significantly change over time during a field trial that lasted for four months, reinforcing the idea of an intuitive design. At the end of such a trial, the user-experience questionnaire achieved excellent scores in all aspects with respect to the benchmark. Good results were also reported by general practitioners who assessed the quality of their remote interfaces for telemonitoring.

AB  - The Internet of Things, with its expanding range of use cases across disciplines, has significantly altered the way we live. One example of an application of the Internet of Things is in the healthcare industry, which links internet-connected gadgets, machinery, patients, and medical professionals. When it comes to healthcare costs, the necessity and accessibility of resources, and personal care in general, particularly for older members of society, healthcare has emerged as a key socioeconomic concern in recent years. This new trend in healthcare has made it feasible for doctors to provide remote monitoring, chronic illness management, and seniors care of patients located in remote areas, and it has even made it possible for doctors to care for patients who are institutionalized so long as they remain connected to the internet. The widespread adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) in healthcare and other similar technologies has helped to tackle a number of problems by utilizing remote monitoring, telemedicine, sensors, and other technologies. However, it seems difficult to accomplish widespread adoption because of considerations such as the need to protect users' privacy and the security of their data, the administration of massive amounts of data, scalability, upgradeability, etc. This new trend is both efficient and clever. The advantages and difficulties of trends in healthcare, which have altered the conventional healthcare system by making health management more effective via to their applications, are discussed in this study.

AB  - Self-monitoring respiratory and cardiac health is challenging without proper equipment and medical knowledge. While Masimo offers ideal remote monitoring through a pulse oximeter, device accessibility is still a significant issue. Thus, we designed a novel device designed for remote monitoring of vital signs using the Internet of Things (IoT) technology and sensor technology in healthcare. Leveraging the capabilities of the modest MAX30102 sensor and ESP32 microcontroller, the device integrates seamlessly with IoT networks, enabling real-time transmission of heart and respiratory rate (RR) data with general assessment feedback to a convenient cellphone application. A sophisticated digital signal processing (DSP) algorithm was implemented in the device, which accurately derives RR from photoplethysmography (PPG) heart rate signals. This DSP-based device ensures precision in RR measurement and facilitates self-monitoring. Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Bland-Altman analysis results demonstrated the device's accuracy and reliability in capturing vital sign data. By bridging IoT capabilities with advanced DSP techniques, the device is a promising solution for remote patient monitoring to improve healthcare.

AB  - On account of privacy preserving issue and health-care monitoring, physiological signal biometric authentication system has gained popularity in recent years. Seismocardiogram (SCG) is now easily accessible owing to the advance of wearable sensor technology. However, SCG biometric has not been widely explored due to the challenging motion artifact removal. In this paper, we design placing the sensors at different body parts under different activities to determine the best sensor location. In addition, we develop SCG noise removal algorithm and utilize machine learning approach to perform biometric authentication tasks. We validate the proposed methods on 20 healthy young adults. The dataset contains acceleration data of sitting, standing, walking, and sitting post-exercise activities with the sensor placed at the wrists, neck, heart and sternum. We demonstrate that vertical and dorsal-ventral SCG near the heart and the sternum produce reliable SCG biometric evidenced by achieving the state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, we present the efficacy of the devised noise removal procedure in the authentication during walking motion.Clinical relevance— A seismocardiography-based biometric authentication system can help serve privacy preserving and reveal cardiovascular functioning information in clinics.

AB  - One of the India's largest issues is providing healthcare to rural people; in rural areas, where more than 70% of the population resides and few medical facilities, disease-related mortality rates are at an all-time high. This research aims to suggest a medicine dispatcher box with temperature, heart rate, and pressure sensors as a component of a comprehensive system for rural real-time health management. The suggested system intends to lessen rural populations' challenges accessing healthcare services by offering a holistic solution that blends health monitoring and medication dispensing functions. The system design consists of a wearable patient device, a medicine dispatcher box, which administers medication based on the received health data, and a gateway device that processes and communicates the data to a cloud-based platform. The proposed system will be usable in rural areas with minimal resources because it is made to be user-friendly and economical. The viability and effectiveness of the suggested system are assessed through a series of experiments. The results demonstrate that the suggested approach can potentially enhance healthcare outcomes and accessibility in remote locations.

AB  - There have already been initiatives to use the new technology in numerous areas to improve the standards of human existence as a result of technological advancement and sensor shrinking. The healthcare industry is one significant field of research where the concept has been adopted. Health services are extraordinarily expensive for the individuals who need them, and this is particularly true in developing nations. As a consequence, this research is an effort to address a contemporary healthcare issue in society. The creation of a remote healthcare system was the project’s principal goal. There are three primary components to it. The first step involved employing sensors for detecting the patient’s vital signs, the second involved transmitting the data to cloud storage, and the final step involved making the detected information available for enabling remote visuals. A doctor or caretaker can remotely access the data and track a patient’s health improvement from a location other than the hospital. The Internet of Things (IoT) principles have been widely applied to connect the available medical resources and provide patients with intelligent, dependable, and efficient healthcare. Among the ideas that can harness the benefits of the IoT to enhance the sufferer’s lifestyle is health monitoring for dynamic and supported living. We have provided an IoT system that has been specially designed for smart healthcare in this project. The proposal’s goal was to develop a Remote Health Monitoring System that could be created using readily accessible local sensors in order to keep costs low if it were to be mass produced. As a result, the presented architecture gathers sensor data using an Arduino microcontroller and transmits it to the cloud for processing and analysis before being made available for remote viewing. In the event of any emergencies, corrective actions depending on the evaluated data can be communicated back to the doctor or guardian by email and SMS notifications.

AB  - The outbreak of COVID-19 hit the world with an incomparable magnitude and introduced new challenges in the diagnosis and treatment of patients. Personal interactions have suddenly become dangerous which can be reduced by the use of digital technology in healthcare. Towards this, we have developed a low-cost remote vital sign monitoring system (VSM) that can be used at hospitals as well as at home for continuous and long-term monitoring of different clinical status, and provide extended support to the vulnerable patients. The proposed VSM has been designed with four layers: sensing layer, data processing layer, networking layer, and applications layer. It comes with three units: a wrist unit, a bedside monitor and a web-based graphical user interface (GUI) accessible by the nurse, physician or attendants remotely from anywhere. The effectiveness of measurement, transmission, and remote monitoring has been demonstrated by experiments. The system is designed with open source and low-cost hardware devices to ensure that it can be afforded and implemented in low resource settings of the developing countries. The proposed system can provide an effective way of delivering care to more patients while protecting everyone involved from infection.

AB  - In an increasingly health-aware population and a move towards remote diagnostics, remote healthcare monitoring and cloud-based med-tech, we tap on the ubiquitous and unlimited reservoir of on-skin biomarkers, including sweat metabolites, in developing a wearable, non-invasive, continuous and real-time sensor – a printed, multiplexed biosensor. Such a device can be colorimetric or electrochemical in its sensing mechanism. Our integrated devices are designed and developed with scalability and translation in mind – ensuring printability (for scalable manufacturing), ease of fabrication routes, and solid-state and miniaturised prototype. In particular, we emphasize on wearable chemo-sensors that allow for non-invasive continuous monitoring of chemical markers from our body (skin) without the presence of bodily fluid, enabling a wide range of use-cases and accessible populations. In such devices, enabling chemo-sensing without a fluidic environment [1] , and addressing the need of a stable, sensitive and selective enzyme complex for the sensor [2] , are two key challenges.

AB  - Advances in cancer therapeutics have dramatically improved the survival rate and quality of life in patients affected by various cancers, but have been accompanied by treatment-related cardiotoxicity, e.g. left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and/or overt heart failure (HF). Cardiologists thus need to assess cancer treatment-related cardiotoxic risks and have close followups for cancer survivors and patients undergoing cancer treatments using serial echocardiography exams and cardiovascular biomarkers testing. Unfortunately, the cost-prohibitive nature of echocardiography has made these routine follow-ups difficult and not accessible to the growing number of cancer survivors and patients undergoing cancer treatments. There is thus a need to develop a wearable system that can yield similar information at a minimal cost and can be used for remote monitoring of these patients. In this proof-of-concept study, we have investigated the use of wearable seismocardiography (SCG) to monitor LV function non-invasively for patients undergoing cancer treatment. A total of 12 subjects (six with normal LV relaxation, five with impaired relaxation and one with pseudo-normal relaxation) underwent routine echocardiography followed by a standard six-minute walk test. Wearable SCG and electrocardiogram signals were collected during the six-minute walk test and, later, the signal features were compared between subjects with normal and impaired LV relaxation. Pre-ejection period (PEP) from SCG decreased significantly (p <; 0.05) during exercise for the subjects with impaired relaxation compared to the subjects with normal relaxation, and changes in PEP/LV ejection time (LVET) were also significantly different between these two groups (p <; 0.05). These results suggest that wearable SCG may enable monitoring of patients undergoing cancer treatments by assessing cardiotoxicity.

AB  - Pregnant women and neonates are the most affected demographic group by the shortfall of accessible healthcare. In this work, we aimed to improve obstetric facilities in rural India by proposing a remote maternal health monitoring device in which pregnant women can avail healthcare services without long-distance travel. We designed and developed a prototype of the proposed device using the open-source Shakti processor to provide remote real-time monitoring of the fetal heart rate (FHR) and uterine contractions for the detection of any abnormalities. Fetal phonocardiography (PCG) signal was picked up using an acoustic sensor, while the electrohysterography (EHG) signal was acquired using surface electrodes placed on a pregnant woman. The placement of the sensor and electrodes was referred by an obstetrician. The system was placed on ten pregnant women in their last trimester with their informed consent and the monitored parameters were validated by a clinician. The obtained FHR and uterine contractions were compared with that from standard clinical devices and the results from the proposed device were observed to be comparable with that of the standard devices.

AB  - The rise of Telemedicine has revolutionized how patients are being treated, leading to several advantages such as enhanced health analysis tools, accessible remote healthcare, basic diagnostic of health parameters, etc. The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI) and their incorporation into Telemedicine extends the potential of health benefits of Telemedicine even further. Therefore, the synergy between AI, IoT, and Telemedicine creates diverse innovative scenarios for integrating cyber-physical systems into medical health to provide remote monitoring and interactive assistance to patients. Data from World Health Organization reports that 7.4 million people died because of Atrial Fibrillation (AF), recognizing the most common arrhythmia associated with human heart rate. Causes like unhealthy diet, smoking, poor resources to go to the doctor and based on research studies, about 12 and 17.9 million of people will be suffering the AF in the USA and Europe, in 2050 and 2060, respectively. The AF as a cardiovascular disease is becoming an important public health issue to tackle. By using a systematic approach, this paper reviews recent contributions related to the acquisition of heart beats, arrhythmia detection, IoT, and visualization. In particular, by analysing the most closely related papers on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and IoT devices in heart disease diagnostics, we present a summary of the main research gaps with suggested directions for future research.

AB  - Over the last few decades, health monitoring systems based on wireless sensor networks have seen an exceptional surge in popularity. Wireless body area networks (WBANs) play a crucial role in enhancing the efficiency of medical services via a remote monitoring environment. Several small battery-operated implanted or wearable sensors in WBAN have many challenges in improving energy, quality, and operational performance. Prioritizing sensor nodes, selecting a sink node, and reducing control packet overheads are all ways to save energy while still handling emergency data, which has always been a significant problem for Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN). Various researchers proposed a modified super-frame architecture of the MAC layer for efficient energy utilization, emergency traffic management, reliability, etc. In this paper, we have discussed significant observations of different MAC layers along modified super-frame architectures proposed by numerous researchers. Later, we provided comparative simulation observations of IEEE 802.15.4 and IEEE 802.15.6. By utilizing Guaranteed Time Slot (GTS) and polling mechanism, these results focus on providing decisive factors for selecting the acceptable MAC protocol in the medical context. Finally, we have provided a conclusion of our analysis for selecting the appropriate MAC protocol in WBAN.

AB  - This article presents a continuous home telemonitoring system for chronic respiratory patients using 5G connectivity developed in partnership with Vodafone as a part of the 5G Trial in Milan established by the Italian Ministry of Economic Development. The system features a wearable respiratory and activity monitor, an environmental sensor and a pulse oximeter sending the data through a 5G router to a Multi-Edge Computing server, incorporated in the Vodafone 5G infrastructure, where they are stored and accessible for visualization. In particular, activity, respiratory and environmental data are continuously streamed and collected. The solution has been tested on 18 healthy volunteers during non-supervised recordings lasting at least 48 hours. The combination of recognized activities and associated respiratory parameters provided statistically significant variations in breathing patterns between one activity and the other, thus giving more complete information to the clinicians than previously studied telemedicine systems based on spot-checks. In particular, statistically significant differences are found in tidal volume and minute ventilation between horizontal and vertical postures (p < 0.001) and between vertical postures and dynamic activities (p < 0.001); the respiratory rate shows statistically significant differences between horizontal and vertical postures (p < 0.001). Some environmental parameters have different mean values between day and night, such as carbon dioxide (p < 0.001). Trials on patients are needed to further study this telemedicine solution and make it commercially available in the future. The main further technical development suggested is the use of commercial 5G smartphones as routers, in order to make the system usable outside of home settings.

AB  - Currently, a big issue is people’s inability to gain entry to health monitoring systems. Internet of Things (IoT) based solutions to remotely track a patient’s vitals are abundant in the fight against this issue. In this article, an IoT based health monitoring system that can track the patient’s core body temperature and heart rate remotely for remote or fatally infected areas, has been developed. With this device, doctors may get accurate readings on the patient’s vitals every 10 seconds. This system will collect that data from the patient’s body and transmit it to an IoT cloud platform. This will make the information accessible from anywhere with an internet connection. The patient’s condition can be tracked in real time, where it can be accessed by the treating physician or other authorized personnel. For remote camping, power efficient solar-battery system also initialized to empower low power medical equipment with vaccine storage to ensure remote health facilities. The system performance was evaluated and presented with field implementation.

AB  - Postural instability is associated with disease status and fall risk in Persons with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS). However, assessments of postural instability, known as postural sway, leverage force platforms or wearable accelerometers, and are most often conducted in laboratory environments and are thus not broadly accessible. Remote measures of postural sway captured during daily life may provide a more accessible alterative, but their ability to capture disease status and fall risk has not yet been established. We explored the utility of remote measures of postural sway in a sample of 33 PwMS. Remote measures of sway differed significantly from lab-based measures, but still demonstrated moderately strong associations with patient-reported measures of balance and mobility impairment. Machine learning models for predicting fall risk trained on lab data provided an Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.79, while remote data only achieved an AUC of 0.51. Remote model performance improved to an AUC of 0.74 after a new, subject-specific k-means clustering approach was applied for identifying the remote data most appropriate for modelling. This cluster-based approach for analyzing remote data also strengthened associations with patient-reported measures, increasing their strength above those observed in the lab. This work introduces a new framework for analyzing data from remote patient monitoring technologies and demonstrates the promise of remote postural sway assessment for assessing fall risk and characterizing balance impairment in PwMS.

AB  - In today's technological climate, users require fast automation and digitization of results for large amounts of data at record speeds. Especially in the field of medicine, where each patient is often asked to undergo many different examinations within one diagnosis or treatment. Each examination can help in the diagnosis or prediction of further disease progression. Furthermore, all produced data from these examinations must be stored somewhere and available to various medical practitioners for analysis who may be in geographically diverse locations. The current medical climate leans towards remote patient monitoring and AI-assisted diagnosis. To make this possible, medical data should ideally be secured and made accessible to many medical practitioners, which makes them prone to malicious entities. Medical information has inherent value to malicious entities due to its privacy-sensitive nature in a variety of ways. Furthermore, if access to data is distributively made available to AI algorithms (particularly neural networks) for further analysis/diagnosis, the danger to the data may increase (e.g., model poisoning with fake data introduction). In this paper, we propose a federated learning approach that uses decentralized learning with blockchain-based security and a proposition that accompanies that training intelligent systems using distributed and locally-stored data for the use of all patients. Our work in progress hopes to contribute to the latest trend of the Internet of Medical Things security and privacy.

AB  - Moved by the necessity, also related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, of the design of innovative solutions in the context of digital health, and digital medicine, Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) are more and more emerging as a central system for the implementation of solutions for well-being and healthcare. In fact, by elaborating the data collected by a WBAN, advanced classification models can accurately extract health-related parameters, thus allowing, as examples, the implementations of applications for fitness tracking, monitoring of vital signs, diagnosis, and analysis of the evolution of diseases, and, in general, monitoring of human activities and behaviours. Unfortunately, commercially available WBANs present some technological and economic drawbacks from the point of view, respectively, of data fusion and labelling, and cost of the adopted devices. To overcome existing issues, in this article, we present the architecture of a low-cost WBAN, which is built upon accessible off-the-shelf wearable devices and an Android application. Then, we report its technical evaluation concerning resource consumption. Finally, we demonstrate its versatility and accuracy in both medical and well-being application scenarios.

AB  - In the pursuit of advancing healthcare technologies and promoting the well-being of the elderly population, this paper presents a conceptual framework for early detection of gait disorders through public IoT-based health monitoring. As global life expectancy continues to rise, there is an increasing need for unobtrusive health monitoring systems that can facilitate the early identification of health issues, particularly among the elderly. While many healthcare monitoring technologies exist, their limited accessibility and deployment in controlled environments or healthcare facilities present challenges. To address this, our innovative concept proposes a smart IoT-based outdoor health monitoring system, specifically designed for public spaces such as parks and supermarkets. This system aims to collect data on mobility, posture, and gait, recognising the crucial role that gait plays in an individual's well-being. The proposed system leverages the power of the Internet of Things (IoT) to gather data seamlessly from individuals in their everyday environments, creating a more holistic and real-world understanding of their health. By analysing gait patterns and deviations, our conceptual framework aims to serve as an early warning system for health-care providers, caregivers, and individuals themselves, alerting them to potential health concerns and enabling proactive intervention. This concept, while in its early stages, holds immense promise for addressing the challenges of an ageing population and reducing healthcare disparities. It aligns with the broader vision of harnessing emerging technologies to enhance the quality of life for the elderly.

AB  - Smart health kits are innovative devices that can monitor various health-related parameters in real time. Inadequate healthcare facilities in rural areas, people have limited access to quality healthcare services, leading to increased morbidity and mortality rates. Lack of patient monitoring makes it challenging to identify and treat illnesses in their early stages since remote patients frequently do not receive routine checkups and monitoring. The enormous cost of healthcare is a significant burden for many individuals, particularly those living in poverty. Inefficient healthcare delivery in the traditional healthcare system is often bogged down by bureaucracy and inefficiency, leading to long wait times, incorrect diagnoses, and ineffective treatments. Real-time healthcare monitoring is necessary to deliver effective treatment. Real-time patient data, such as vital signs, medical history, and other pertinent information, must be available to healthcare practitioners. The goal of the smart healthcare kit using an embedded system is to address the health problems of persons while driving vehicles. The embedded medical sensors such as temperature, heart rate, and alcohol gas sensors collect and transmit patient data to healthcare providers in real time enabling them to make informed decisions about patient care. This kit may be mounted to the steering wheel of any vehicle, making it simple to use and accessible for anyone while driving. The temperature sensor keeps track of the driver’s body temperature and alerts the driver if it rises above a certain threshold. The heart rate sensor monitors the heart rate and notifies the user when it changes unexpectedly. Similarly, an alcohol gas sensor measures the alcohol concentration in the driver’s exhaled breath to determine whether they have consumed alcohol. Thus, the smart health kit is an effective tool that can detect serious health hazards, ensure motorists are healthy while operating vehicles, and prevent accidents caused by medical conditions or alcohol consumption; this greatly increases the safety of individuals, particularly those who drive professionally. The availability of real-time health monitoring and notifications enables people to take preventative action to maintain their health and stay safe.

AB  - After a cerebral stroke, survivors need to follow a neurorehabilitation program including exercises to be executed under a therapist's supervision or autonomously. Technological solutions are needed to support the early discharge of the patients just after the primary hospital treatments, by still providing an adequate level of rehabilitation. The DoMoMEA Project proposes a fully-wearable m-health solution able to administer a neurorehabilitation therapy in the patient's home or every other place established by the patient for a rehabilitation session. The exploitation of magneto-inertial measurement units only, wirelessly connected to an Android-operated device, provides robustness to different operating conditions and immunity to optical occlusion problems, compared to RGB-D cameras. Patients' engagement is fostered by the exploitation of the exergame version of the ten rehabilitation exercises, implemented in Unity 3D. Store-and-forward telemonitoring features, supported by cloud-based storage and by a web application accessible from anywhere by medical personnel and patients, enable constant transparent monitoring of the rehabilitation progresses. The clinical trial of the DoMoMEA telerehabilitation system will involve 40 post-stroke patients with mild impairment and will start as soon as the restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic will allow to enroll patients.
