AB  - Information and communication technology has advanced in recent days, which has lead to the emergenceof Internet of Things (IoT). The healthcare monitoring system is widely used for various purposes in the current scenario. The fetal measurement and fetal diagnosing can be done using Internet of Things based Health Care Monitoring Systems. An accelerometer sensor can only measure the outside movement of the body and it is not able to measure internal body movements. The measurement can be done only in one, two and three orthogonal axes (3D direction). An accelerometer sensor can be used for fetal movement measurement by only giving a high-frequency range. When the high frequency is given, the object should be at rest to control the resting condition, it shouldn't move at least for one inch. The fetal movement can be only done in the month of 9th or 10th month. The vibration of fetal heartbeat can be noticed. But the proper output is not obtained practically yet. This paper discuss the work related to appropriate selection of the sensor and programming which provides accurate movement of the fetal and the distance. The newly developed equipment with ultrasound sensor and proximity sensor are used to identify the distance of fetus and mother skin and the size of the fetus, respectively. All these can be measured during the every month of pregnancy. With the support of raspberry Pi, the general working functions of the equipment can improve the speed of the output. The expected conclusion is an ideal ultrasound sensor programmed with raspberry pi which determines/predicts the working function of fetus, and can be so called as fetus monitoring system.

AB  - Digital connectivity is fundamental to the health care system to deliver safe and effective care. However, insecure connectivity could be a major threat to patient safety and privacy (e.g., in August 2017, FDA recalled 465,000 pacemakers because of discovering security flaws). Although connecting a patient's pacemaker to the Internet has many advantages for monitoring the patient, this connectivity opens a new door for cyber-attackers to steal the patient data or even control the pacemaker or damage it. Therefore, patients are forced to choose between connectivity and security. This paper presents a framework for secure and private communications between wearable medical devices and patient monitoring systems. The primary objective of this research is twofold, first to identify and analyze the communication vulnerabilities, second, to develop a framework for combating unauthorized access to data through the compromising of computer security. Specifically, hiding targets from cyber-attackers could prevent our system from future cyber-attacks. This is the most effective way to stop cyber-attacks in their first step.

AB  - One can expect a day to come where internet would connect people from across the globe whenever required and become a mainstay for business function. But the realization of this would need a lot of time. Internet of Things is still in a primary stage and development has a long way to go. Wide range applications for IoT require infrastructure, application architecture, security measures and a standard system is yet to be established. By introducing IoT, several challenges, constraints, security concerns have to be addressed differently unlike the currently existing data systems. The current systems use make use of easy to implement standards and these are compatible for most of the devices used in communications and storage systems. But no such standard exists for devices using IoT owing to the various constraints arising between different devices that results in different classifications within IoT itself. It also discusses the requirement of security architectures for IoT and feasible mechanisms that can be implemented for various architecture layers of IoT for e-Health applications. The challenges faced in order to integrate IoT into health care applications are also discussed alongside the standards and security mechanisms. IoT can be considered as a key to providing improved medical facilities for patients whilst facilitating doctors, staff and hospitals. Most importantly, this work presents the ways to handle security for implementing IoT in healthcare sector not only in the currently existing systems but also for future applications. The current systems that use various domains and different technologies have been studied and analyzed to present a clear and precise solutions to challenges faced by IoT implementations as of today.This electronic document is a “live” template and already defines the components of you

AB  - Recently, during the COVID-19 situation, the requirement and importance of tracking patients from a remote location have increased significantly. Most patients now prefer to obtain their doctor’s care and check their health status through their mobile phone call, Skype, Facebook Messenger, or other online resources. There is, however, a major concern about the privacy of patients when using online resources. Patients usually choose to keep their information confidential, which should be only accessible to authorized individuals. The most current remote patient monitoring system is organization-centric and patient’s privacy and security rely on healthcare providers’ mercy. Blockchain technologies have attracted the attention of researchers for designing eHealth applications to provide patients with secure and privacy-preserving health services. Blockchain researchers have recently proposed some models for remote patient monitoring systems. However, most of those researchers have applied public blockchains where health data is available to all participants with the property of data tamper-proof. In this paper, we propose a novel remote patient monitoring model using a decentralized private blockchain to protect patient’s privacy and increase the system’s efficiency. The private blockchain will be implemented on Hyperledger Fabric where a Patient-centric Agents (PCA) manage patient’s data and coordinate authorization to form a secure channel to transmit data to the private blockchain. A hybrid consensus by combining Proof of Integrity (PoI) and Proof of Validity (PoV) is used to protect data privacy and integrity when retrieving data from a blockchain-based cloud database. Finally, the Merkle Tree algorithm was used for data processing and authentication when collecting data and uploading it to a cloud database.

AB  - Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) is a form of telehealth or virtual health that strengthens online medical services and allows delivering healthcare remotely. Nowadays, remote patient monitoring systems (RPMS) are widely used by healthcare providers to remotely monitor the vital signs of patients. As the RPM field expands, concerns about efficient and secure medical data transmission are raised. This kind of patient medical data is collected by the mean of Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT) or sometimes denoted as Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices. The collected data needs to be stored and retrieved with highly assured levels of security and privacy as the data comprises private and critical patients’ information. To secure medical data, this paper proposes a blockchain-based architecture to manage access control to medical data and to preserve patient’s data privacy. The blockchain-based system is built on Hyperledger Fabric, a permissioned distributed ledger solution, and the ledgers and transactions are stored in the cloud. The proposed architecture is designed to contribute to the robustness of the RPM systems and to avoid recorded security limitations in commonly used permissioned blockchains methods. Performance evaluation has proved the robustness and superiority of the proposed system in terms of data confidentiality, integrity, availability, traceability, scalability, and data privacy while integrated with the RPM services.

AB  - Chronic respiratory illnesses exert a major strain on healthcare systems globally, necessitating creative ways to optimize patient outcomes and treatment. This work presents a new technique for remote monitoring and treatment of chronic respiratory illnesses that blends wearable sensor data with artificial intelligence (AI). The method's properties are highlighted, including the employment of Random Forest, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) as three important algorithms for modeling illness development, forecasting exacerbations, and spotting abnormalities in real-time patient data. Our method has proven to be a big success. It is now conceivable to consistently forecast illness exacerbations, which speeds up medical treatments and decreases the likelihood of life-threatening respiratory crises. Real-time vital sign monitoring gives comprehensive, up-to-date data to patients and healthcare practitioners while allowing people to actively govern their own health. Real-time feedback and individualized treatment regimens assist in enhancing patient involvement. By addressing privacy and ethical concerns, adequate data management has been achieved. The integration of wearable sensors with AI provides a considerable improvement in the treatment of chronic respiratory illnesses. It enables for a more proactive, patient-centered, and data-driven approach to healthcare. The results not only boost patient outcomes, but also offer the ability to minimize healthcare expenses and deliver tailored therapy on a worldwide scale.

AB  - The aging population and the growing requirement of healthcare services in clinics encourage the arrival of remote elderly patient monitoring. Development in the physiologic sensory systems and the advancement of stable wireless network low energy mechanics have allowed remote health monitoring systems to be developed. Smart homes, which have wearable sensors and medical actuators, as well as up-to-date communication and information technology, have the ability to monitor remotely the elderly health and well-being in a simple fashion with low cost. Therefore, the elderly will stay in their comfortable homes rather than going to hospitals where sometimes they face expensive and limited facilities. In a real-time, medical staff can also keep track of the overall health conditions of the elderly people and provide proper feedback and support at a distance. In this paper, we introduce a summary of elderly people monitoring applications using IoT frameworks. In addition, the paper discusses the patient data security and integrity.

AB  - Wearable technology has played an essential role in the Mobile Health (mHealth) sector for diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation of numerous diseases and disorders. One such neuro-degenerative disorder is Parkinson’s Disease (PD). It is categorized by motor symptoms that affect a patient’s motor skills and non-motor symptoms that affect the general health of a PD patient. The quality of life of a patient with PD is highly compromised. To date, there is no cure for the disease, but early intervention and assistive care can help a PD patient to perform daily activities with considerable ease. Many research works in PD management discuss the challenges that healthcare professionals face in the early detection and management of this disease. Sensor devices have been promising to overcome these challenges to a certain degree because of the low cost and accuracy in measurement, yielding precise conclusive results to detect, monitor, and manage PD. This paper presents a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) that provides an in-depth analysis of the PD symptoms, Motor and Non-Motor Symptoms (NMS), the current diagnosis and management techniques used and their efficacy. The paper also highlights the work of various researchers in wearable sensors and their proposals to improve the quality of life of a PD patient by diagnosing, monitoring, and managing PD symptoms remotely via wearable sensors. Another area of focus is commercially available wearables for PD management and a few promising works in progress. This paper will be beneficial for future researchers to identify existing gaps and provide the clinicians better insight into the disease progression, and avoid complications. This paper analyzes around 50+ articles from 2016 to 2021 and concludes that there is still much room for improvement in wearables for PD management during the research process. While much work has been attributed to PD Motor Symptom management, there is little focus on the management of PD NMS via wearable sensors. Furthermore, this paper also presents future work for PD management.

AB  - Nowadays, ubiquitous healthcare monitoring applications are becoming a necessity. In a pervasive smart healthcare system, the user's location information is always transmitted periodically to healthcare providers to increase the quality of the service provided to the user. However, revealing the user's location will affect the user's privacy. This paper presents a novel cloud-based secure location privacy-preserving mobile healthcare framework with decision-making capabilities. A user's vital signs are sensed possibly through a wearable healthcare device and transmitted to a cloud server for securely storing user's data, processing, and decision making. The proposed framework integrates a number of features such as machine learning (ML) for classifying a user's health state, and crowdsensing for collecting information about a person's privacy preferences for possible locations and applying such information to a user who did not set his privacy preferences. In addition to location privacy preservation methods (LPPM) such as obfuscation, perturbation and encryption to protect the location of the user and provide a secure monitoring framework. The proposed framework detects clear emergency cases and quickly decides about sending a help message to a healthcare provider before sending data to the cloud server. To validate the efficiency of the proposed framework, a prototype is developed and tested. The obtained results from the proposed prototype prove its feasibility and utility. Compared to the state of art, the proposed framework offers an adaptive context-based decision for location sharing privacy and controlling the trade-off between location privacy and service utility.

AB  - One of the prominent research endeavors in the healthcare sector revolves around the applications of Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs), which offer substantial potential for remote monitoring of human health. This research project is centered on the development of a wearable WBAN application dedicated to the remote monitoring of individuals' health. The primary objective is to continuously capture, process, and transmit human physiological parameters for health monitoring. ECG, SPO2, heart rate, and respiration are just some of the vital physiological signals that are measured by the four specialized biomedical sensor nodes used in this application. These measurements are then converted into actionable data. Subsequently, a processor processes this data and sends it to a central node using a transceiver. The central node serves as a hub for collecting and transmitting the data in real-time to a monitoring PC, where the physiological parameters are visually displayed and recorded on a graphical interface.

AB  - Healthcare industry is evolving rapidly due to the rigorous research and development in health care industry and is contributing to the enormous development the most happening and upcoming innovative block chain technology. This development in both health care and technological industry has enhanced the quality of fitness of an individual by the use of miniaturized sensors that could be invasively or non-invasively embedded to monitor human vital signs to offer a secure patient healthcare system. When sharing personal medical information, data security and comfort are essential requirements for interaction with electronic medical records. However, it is hard for current systems to meet these requirements because they have inconsistent security policies and access control structures. Another problem is switching the medical providers that is extremely unmanageable and creates tedious issues for medical claim approvals since maximum advanced healthcare systems are distributed greatly with low speed issues and frauds. The new solutions should be directed towards improving data access and should be managed by the government in terms of privacy and security requirements to ensure the reliability of data for medical purposes. Block chain technology is the most unique and real solution that promises secure patient data coordination and whole healthcare system, provides pre-approved constraints. Block chain paves the way for a revolution in the traditional pharmaceutical industry and benefits from unique features such as data privacy and transparency. This paper proposes a block chain solution to facilitate patients and healthcare system users to access their health care records with smart contract technology.

AB  - The study aims to analyze consumer perception toward adopting Internet of Things (IoT) technology in healthcare. In contrast to earlier studies that focused on the technical aspects, the proposed integrated paradigm measures how user trust is affected by the existence of security and privacy concerns, and knowledge of the Internet of Things. The proposed architecture presents a holistic system for health data management that is secure and efficient in modern health systems, designed and developed using four layers: hospital, remote IoT integrated medical device, distributed medical record, and AI-based smart contract. The system is supposed to enhance security of data and efficiency in its management with integration of the blockchain technology and the AI-based intelligence. The hospital layer is similar to the database that stores the data of the patient, and the distributed medical record layer makes the storage of the data and the access from it secure through blockchain. The data transfer of the health parameters of the patient through the IoT-enabled medical node can be done using the blockchain. The Al-based smart contract layer brings in the intelligence of the system for automatic decision-making and proactive breach detection. Evaluation was made on the system’s performance under different conditions, such as transaction processing time, average delay, where it demonstrated scalability, reliability, and robustness in the management of health data and hence sounds quite promising for this domain of modern healthcare.

AB  - Over the years, the popularity and usage of wearable Internet of Things (IoT) devices in several healthcare services are increased. Among the services that benefit from the usage of such devices is predictive analysis, which can improve early diagnosis in e-health. However, due to the limitations of wearable IoT devices, challenges in data privacy, service integrity, and network structure adaptability arose. To address these concerns, we propose a platform using federated learning and private blockchain technology within a fog-IoT network. These technologies have privacy-preserving features securing data within the network. We utilized the fog-IoT network’s distributive structure to create an adaptive network for wearable IoT devices. We designed a testbed to examine the proposed platform’s ability to preserve the integrity of a classifier. According to experimental results, the introduced implementation can effectively preserve a patient’s privacy and a predictive service’s integrity. We further investigated the contributions of other technologies to the security and adaptability of the IoT network. Overall, we proved the feasibility of our platform in addressing significant security and privacy challenges of wearable IoT devices in predictive healthcare through analysis, simulation, and experimentation.

Internet of Things (IoT), being one of the most revolutionizing technology, has been impacting all fields of life immensely, but its impact on the healthcare industry has been particularly significant due to its cutting edge transition. The objective of this paper is to understand the role of IoT in this sector, its various use cases, and on how the devices assists medical professionals to function more efficiently and patients for an enhanced treatment. For instance, the Intelligent Asthma Monitoring wearable technology can forecast the oncoming asthma attack way before the person wearing it can comprehend. Apple watches, though not designed with this agenda in the first place, have now been a significant part in gathering information about people with the new blood oxygen measuring functionality, echocardiogram (ECG) tracking, and also detecting irregular heartbeat which is an indicator of Atrial Fibrillation (AFib). Furthermore, the paper will also address the probable challenges of the technology in the sector and understand the current and future adaptability of internet of medical thing devices.

AB  - It’s absurd for a clinical master to monitor a patient’s pulse and body temperature all the time from a remote location using standard monitoring equipment. As a solution to this problem, we may develop an Internet of Things-based framework that makes use of a microcontroller and a user-friendly temperature sensor known as the DS18B20 (which is a kind of temperature sensor that provides 9-bit to 12-bit measurements of temperature). An emerging concept of a linked e-health system that includes Personal Health Devices has emerged due to recent advances in consumer electronics and rising healthcare expenditures. It was found that incorporating ICT into the healthcare sector may help maximize the availability of all medical resources while also providing dependable, efficient care for the elderly and those with physical impairments or long-term sickness. This article sheds some insight on the currently available methods for Internet of Things-based healthcare applications. An IoT-based healthcare system using Pattern Matching Algorithm is presented which gathers patient data from different sensors and sends messages alerting the caregiver and doctor in real time. It keeps track of the patient’s physiological characteristics from a distance and makes early diagnoses of illness. Using a Wireless Body Area Network, this may be integrated into a wearable alert system. The suggested solution’s network overhead and appropriateness for various settings are discussed, including how different wireless interfaces integrate with a cloud service.

AB  - A new method for acquiring device information using optical character recognition (OCR) for remote monitoring of the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) device was developed in this study. The ECMO device used was the SP-200 (Terumo Corp.) because initially its information could not be directly acquired for remote monitoring. In addition, the data management system (DMS) is a software that runs on a tablet PC and can collectively manage and display device information. Therefore, we used the screen output of a tablet PC running DMS to acquire the device information of SP-200 with OCR.A Raspberry Pi 4 Model B was used to capture the laptop PC display output that displayed a DMS image and read the device information with OCR. The captured image was then processed with Raspberry Pi into an image suitable for OCR. By reading with OCR, it was possible to acquire device information from a device from which it was initially not possible to directly do so.

AB  - Recent trends in the healthcare industry, such as the use of wearable IoT for continuous health monitoring, are setting new requirements for healthcare systems that boost data analysis. These systems should support decentralization and maintain the privacy and ownership of users' data due to the sensitivity of healthcare data. Therefore, the use of federated learning techniques is recommended for systems that need such requirements. This paper proposes a Deep Federated Learning framework for decentralized healthcare systems that maintain user privacy in a distributed architecture. It also proposes an algorithm for an automated training data acquiring process. Furthermore, it presents an experiment for using deep federated learning in detecting skin diseases and using Transfer Learning to address the problem of limited availability of healthcare data in building deep learning models. The evaluated results show how the federated learning increased the Area Under the Curve of the centralized learning model up to 0.97, as it also shows good model performance during federated rounds in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Moreover, although the FL system has affected the quality of service to the user in terms of model conversion time, the Federated Learning system meets the requirements of building models in a decentralized manner with no sharing of users' private data.

AB  - The rise of smart health technologies has offered benefits such as remote patient monitoring, personalized therapy, and early disease detection. However this advancement has also raised concerns about security and privacy of patient data. Authentication is essential for protecting patient data and smart health devices. The existing scheme is identified with security vulnerabilities in terms of stolen verifier, impersonation, and man in middle attacks. Motivated by this, authors have presented a secure, lightweight authentication technique for smart health environments for a remote monitoring scenario employing a Multiple Factor approach and a lightweight algorithm. The scheme is verified through formal and informal analysis. The scheme demonstrated enhanced authentication performance and security with processing overhead of (0.04 milliseconds) and transmission overhead of (704 bits), in comparison to the baseline scheme. This system has the potential to improve data security and privacy in a variety of smart health scenarios.

AB  - Health care services have become a high demand due to the rise in medical technology. As a result, related resources are being depleted. Hospitals no longer have any space to accommodate for incoming patients. Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) is a solution to this issue by creating a convenient and easy to access healthcare service. However, RPM systems are constrained by concerns on patient privacy, response time, and patient-service interaction. Patients emphasize their privacy, which requires health care services to maintain the confidentiality of their patient’s information. Wearable health monitors continuously transmit data. This feature results in high volumes of data transmissions towards the servers. In the current state of wearable devices, there is a lack of giving the patient an integrated means of interacting with the healthcare centre and vice versa. In this paper, we propose an architecture that uses fog computing and Internet of Things (IoT) devices to an already existing RPM system and addresses these challenges. The introduced system enables the health care providers to verify any of their data through a local server before it is reported to the main server. Also, this design incorporates a data filter that controls the outgoing data to maintain patient privacy. Finally, the inclusion of a local server offloads the extra data processing that is required from the server for a better flow of data. Tests in latency were executed to investigate the feasibility of a scalable fog architecture against a standard cloud-device setup. The results show that the proposed fog setup yielded significantly lower latencies under an increasing number of RPM rooms compared to the cloud setup. Results further support the fog and IoT-based architecture as a potential option for a scalable RPM.

AB  - The dramatic progresses of wireless technologies and wearable devices have significantly promoted the development and popularity of smart home, while digital twin (DT) emerges as a game changer benefiting from its enhanced capabilities of visualization and interaction. The DT is able to build a realtime and continuous visual replica of a physical object or process, and to provide realtime monitoring, anomaly prediction, smart interaction, and lifecycle management. This paper presents a DT model to empower healthcare monitoring in the smart home with the goals of graphical monitoring, healthcare prediction, and intelligent control. High fidelity DT of the house and its equipments is created for visualized monitoring, and two suites of devices are deployed for continuously acquiring the users’ electrocardiograph (ECG) waves and the WiFi signals in the house. Two intelligent algorithms are then developed to perform fall detection from WiFi signals and to screen atrial fibrillation from ECG waves collected by wearable devices. Experimental results well validate the proposed model’s effectiveness for smart home monitoring, and the advantages of the developed smart algorithms for healthcare prediction over counterparts.

AB  - This paper outlines the development of a wearable device to measure knee joint flexion angles and compares its performance to a computer vision based human pose model. The objective is to advance techniques used in measuring joint flexion angles, which have several drawbacks such as relying heavily on the clinician for accuracy while also being invasive as they require physical contact between the patient and orthopaedic specialist. The proposed implementations integrate digital innovation in orthopaedic healthcare while being affordable and easy to deploy, making them marketable to clinicians and patients in developing countries. To evaluate the workability of the implementations, knee flexion angle measurements of a test subject were obtained using both techniques which yielded consistent and comparable flexion angle readings. Further development of this work can have a significant impact on the accessibility and affordability of innovative healthcare monitoring technologies, especially for patients in developing countries.

AB  - In this paper, a comprehensive framework for protecting sensitive healthcare information in Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is presented. Sensitive medical data is protected by the proposed architecture's usage of secure data transmission protocols, encryption, access control, and authentication. It also looks at how the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other data privacy regulations might affect IoT-enabled healthcare infrastructure. The study results indicate a need for more privacy and security education and implementation throughout the healthcare, technology, government, and user communities. The need of teaching healthcare professionals and patients about the dangers of sharing personal information online and the importance of managing data ethically is discussed. New loopholes and dangers can only be patched if security is regularly assessed, audited, and improved. This research paper sheds light on the problems of privacy and confidentiality in WSN healthcare applications enabled by the Internet of Things. The effort aims to safeguard and defend healthcare IoT adoption and enhance patient care by offering a complete framework that emphasizes regulatory compliance and appropriate data management.

AB  - The rapid advances in the Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT) technologies are revolutionizing the healthcare landscape by deploying implantable devices that require optimized, energy-autonomous design and personalized healthcare delivery. However, the need for continuous power supply in low-power implanted medical devices presents significant challenges. To overcome these challenges, this paper presents a high-efficiency rectenna for the 2.45 GHz ISM band for RF energy harvesting circuits. A new approach to improve the performance of Rectanna is explained. It's shown that using the overall circuit optimization built into ADS is the best way to improve the matched impedance between the antenna and the rectifier circuit. Though it leads to an increase in the output voltage and the efficiency of the RF-to-DC conversion. The results compared with the state-of-the-art demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed circuit. A high gain of 3.7 dB and an S11 (Return Loss) of -40 dB at a frequency of 2.45 GHz is achieved by designing a truncated edge circular patch antenna and rectifier circuit using an Advanced Design System. An impressive efficiency of 72% at 0 dBm input power at 2.45 GHz is attained by the rectifier circuit, generating sufficient electrical output energy of 25 dBw to power low-power electronic equipment at a DC voltage. Our research holds significant potential for improving the reliability and efficiency of implantable medical devices by ensuring a stable power supply and reducing reliance on conventional batteries

AB  - In recent years, healthcare systems have included the Internet of Things (IoT) technology in their services, such as in remote patient monitoring systems. Wearable IoT devices can provide information regarding the patient's health that are accurate and time-sensitive. However, vulnerabilities are evident as more IoT devices connect to the network. For healthcare services, the security of patient data is an issue. At the same time, with real-time data transmissions, the network runs into manageability concerns. In this work, we propose a private blockchain-based Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) platform to aid wearable IoT devices in healthcare services. We chose this blockchain technology due to its strengths in security. Then, we enable a distributive architecture using WBANs to introduce a decentralized configuration that can ensure privacy among wearable IoT devices within the network. To evaluate the feasibility of the proposed platform in terms of latency and throughput, we conducted experiments with several wearable IoT devices. The results show that integrating a WBAN to create a fog server improves the network performance with an increasing number of IoT devices and packet size. Also, the blockchain showed its ability to address security threats in healthcare services. We evaluate our proposed platform through a performance test and a STRIDE threat model, and we prove its feasibility in improving the security and manageability of wearable IoT devices in healthcare.

AB  - The Internet of Things(IoT) can transfer data between the sensor node and the cloud server with the Internet’s help for various automated tasks like remote monitoring and controlling. IoT has various applications in different sections, including healthcare, also called the Internet of Medical Things(IoMT). IoT used in healthcare applications can collect patient’s biomedical data through medical sensors, which is sent to the cloud server with the help of the Internet. IoT/IoMT systems are having serious challenging concerns such as data security and IoT device’s security. Hence, this paper proposes a Physically Unclonable Function(PUF) based lightweight mutual authentication and key agreement protocol for IoT/IoMT devices. A lightweight AEAD cipher, ASCON, and a PUF are used for mutual authentication and key agreement between the IoT/IoMT device and the server. The agreed key is used for encrypting the sensor node data using ASCON cipher. The protocol is implemented in Artix-7 FPGA, and the formal verification is performed using the automated tool Proverif. The proposed protocol takes 912 bits of communication cost, which is 13% less compared to the best existing protocol. Further, the protocol requires a node storage cost of 128 bits, which is only 66% of the best existing protocol.

AB  - Globally, cardiovascular disorders, including Atrial Fibrillation (AF), are a major health issue. Telemedicine and cloud-based neural networks are used to improve heart disease diagnosis and monitoring for AF patients in this research. Our technique uses remote patient monitoring and AI to improve AF diagnosis, treatment, and management. This paper develops a cloud-integrated neural network model to interpret real-time patient electrocardiogram (ECG) data. The neural network is trained on a broad dataset to detect modest AF start or progression patterns. Scalable, accessible, and effective data management is achieved using cloud computing. Telemedicine is crucial to this framework since it allows patients to be monitored remotely. Healthcare practitioners get notifications for abnormal ECG patterns, allowing quick intervention and individualized treatment. Patient data is safely saved in the cloud for long-term analysis and population-level AF research. The suggested telemedicine method improves AF event detection accuracy, according to preliminary data. Cloud-based neural networks improve diagnostics and enable healthcare research and information exchange. The system advances cardiac disease management, emphasizing AF, using integration and technology. This research may improve patient outcomes, lower healthcare costs, and increase population-level cardiovascular health knowledge. Teleconsultations maintain patient care while protecting sensitive health data. The system’s flexibility and learning increase diagnostic accuracy.

AB  - The technical advancements in Mobile communication and the possibility of networking physical devices have made a great impact on the development of real-time monitoring and control applications across various fields. There is a rising demand for online monitoring of the health factors of a patient, who is staying at a remote location and elders suffering from health issues and not able to travel to the hospital. Safeguarding the privacy of the patient data is a paramount challenge while observing patient health conditions through IoT. We have introduced a Real-Time Distant Healthcare Monitoring IoT System (RTDHMIS) which protects the patient data using a lightweight block cipher BEST -1 (Better Encryption Security Technique-1). Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN) comprise many sensor nodes, which are implanted in the patient's body for data collection. Since wearable sensor nodes are resource-constrained devices, it is essential to use a lightweight cryptographic algorithm for data protection. The block cipher BEST -1 provides a good security mechanism against many known security attacks. The security and efficiency of the newly introduced system are compared with related systems and it is found that the performance of RTDHMIS is better for implementation in a healthcare environment.

AB  - Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is becoming ubiquitous with a proliferation of smart medical devices and applications used in smart hospitals, smart-home based care, and nursing homes. It utilizes smart medical devices and cloud computing services along with core Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to sense patients' vital body parameters, monitor health conditions and generate multivariate data to support just-in-time health services. Mostly, this large amount of data is analyzed in centralized servers. Anomaly Detection (AD) in a centralized healthcare ecosystem is often plagued by significant delays in response time with high performance overhead. Moreover, there are inherent privacy issues associated with sending patients' personal health data to a centralized server, which may also introduce several security threats to the AD model, such as possibility of data poisoning. To overcome these issues with centralized AD models, here we propose a Federated Learning (FL) based AD model which utilizes edge cloudlets to run AD models locally without sharing patients' data. Since existing FL approaches perform aggregation on a single server which restricts the scope of FL, in this paper, we introduce a hierarchical FL that allows aggregation at different levels enabling multi-party collaboration. We introduce a novel disease-based grouping mechanism where different AD models are grouped based on specific types of diseases. Furthermore, we develop a new Federated Time Distributed (FEDTIMEDIS) Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) approach to train the AD model. We present a Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) use case to demonstrate our model, and illustrate a proof-of-concept implementation using Digital Twin (DT) and edge cloudlets.

AB  - The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has revolutionized the healthcare domain, with the introduction of remote real-time monitoring. This emerging technology has not only relieved the burden of hospital resources, but also paved the way for efficient monitoring and management of patients. According to World Health Organization (WHO), in Pakistan, cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are leading cause of deaths that amount to nearly 200,000 deaths annually. This results in high mortality rates all over Pakistan. To uplift the current architecture of healthcare in Pakistan, it is vital to develop a sustainable solution for continuous health monitoring and arrest anomalous physiological behavior before they become life-threatening. In the same pretext, this study proposes a working paper which aims to disseminate interim results of smart cardiac health monitoring using an amalgam of IoMT and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The primary objective of the proposed research is to integrate state-of-the-art ML classification algorithms to detect, in near real-time, abnormal human vitals like electrocardiogram(ECG), heart-rate(HR), blood pressure(BP), etc. As network latency is critical to this application, therefore, to improve overall Quality of Service (QoS) of the system, we propose to fuse Edge Intelligence interfaced with multiple IoMT enabled bio-sensors. These sensors will form a body area sensor network(BSN) that records cardiac-related human vitals. In our preliminary research, that is presented in this paper, we trained several machine learning algorithms on the MIMIC-III clinical data-set and reviewed their performance. Among the 7 tested supervised classification algorithms, Random-Forest achieved the highest accuracy of 95% on the test set. Finally, to offer a remote patient management and monitoring panel, we developed an authenticated web-portal to inculcate data privacy and security in the proposed system.

AB  - The potential of distributed ledger technology (DLT) to transform various industries, such as healthcare, has been widely acknowledged. Due to the increasing interest in the technology's use in monitoring health data. One of the most important advantages of DLT in monitoring is its ability for creating secure and reliable records. This feature allows for the preservation of sensitive information, and it can be used to protect the data of various individuals. In addition, it can allow researchers and healthcare providers to share information between themselves and other healthcare organizations. One of the main advantages of DLT in the monitoring of health data is its ability to improve interoperability. This technology can help create a decentralized system that will allow healthcare providers to store and share health data. This eliminates the need for central data hubs and enables them to access and use the information they need to improve patient care. Another advantage of DLT in monitoring is it's ability to allow healthcare organizations to use smart contracts. This feature can help them automate various processes, such as drug supply chain management and claims management. Despite the various advantages of DLT in monitoring, there are still many challenges that need to be addressed in order to successfully implement it in the field. One of these is the lack of interoperability. This issue can prevent DLT systems from being able to work seamlessly with other systems. Also, the lack of regulations is a major concern when it comes to the use of DLT in healthcare. The potential of DLT to significantly impact the monitoring industry is immense. Its ability to improve data interoperability and secure storage can lead to the creation of more effective and efficient systems. However, it's important to note that the technology still has a long way to go before it fully realizes its full potential. This paper aims to review the literature on the subject.

Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) systems offer a solution by enabling continuous monitoring and real-time communication between patients and healthcare providers. The increasing size of transmitted data, energy consumption and the need for real-time responsiveness are identified as key issues. This paper focuses on optimizing the RPM system, with an emphasis on data security and transmission efficiency. Our research aims to enhance the efficiency and reliability of RPM by proposing solutions that optimize communication protocols, data management, and security measures. These findings contribute to the advancement of RPM systems, ensuring effective remote monitoring and timely healthcare interventions for patients with chronic illnesses. The transmission of data from sensors and the communication between nodes and the cloud are examined, considering the security requirements of the IoT platform. To tackle these challenges, the paper presents four optimization approaches/tools for both the system and payload. These tools encompass enhancing communication between the cloud and nodes, optimizing node-level information, reducing payload size prior to data transmission, and implementing data compression techniques in conjunction with a feature-based psychovisual coding approach. The proposed optimizations aim to enhance the overall performance and efficiency of the system, ensuring timely response and reliable data transmission.

AB  - Recently, blockchain-based Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has started to receive more attention in the healthcare domain as it not only improves the care quality using real-time and continuous monitoring but also minimizes the cost of care. However, there is a clear trend to include many entities in IoMT systems, such as IoMT sensor nodes, IoT wearable medical devices, patients, healthcare centers, and insurance companies. This makes it challenging to design a blockchain framework for these systems where scalability is a most critical factor in blockchain technology. Motivated by this observation, in this survey we review the state-of-the-art in blockchain-IoMT systems. Comparison and analysis of such systems prove that there is a substantial gap, which is the negligence of scalability. In this survey, we discuss several approaches proposed in the literature to improve the scalability of blockchain technology, and thus overcoming the above mentioned research gap. These approaches include on-chain and off-chain techniques, based on which we give recommendations and directions to facilitate designing a scalable blockchain-based IoMT system. We also recommended that a designer considers the well-known trilemma along with the various dimensions of a scalable blockchain system to prevent sacrificing security and decentralization as well. Moreover, we raise several research questions regarding benchmarking; addressing these questions could help designers determining the existing bottlenecks, leading to a scalable blockchain.

AB  - Federated learning (FL), collaboratively training a shared global model without exchanging and centralizing local data, provides a promising solution for privacy preserving. On the other hand, it is faced with two main challenges: First, high communication cost, and second, low model quality due to imbalanced or nonindependent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. In this article, we propose FedVAE, an FL framework based on variational autoencoder (VAE) for remote patient monitoring. FedVAE contains two lightweight VAEs: one for projecting data onto a lower dimensional space with similar distribution so as to alleviate the issues of excessive communication overhead and slow convergence rate caused by non-IID data, and the other for shunning training bias due to imbalanced data distribution through generating minority class samples. In general, the proposed FedVAE can improve the overall performance of FL models while consuming only a small amount of communication bandwidth. The experimental results show that the area under the curve (AUC) value of FedVAE can reach 0.9937, which is even higher than that of the traditional centralized model (0.9931). Besides, fine-tuning the global model with personalization can raise the average AUC to 0.9947. Moreover, compared with vanilla FL, FedVAE shows 0.87% improvement in AUC while reducing communication traffic by at least 95%.

AB  - Due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, interest in non-face-to-face telehealth is increasing worldwide, and telehealth services are being activated in various fields. In some countries, successful cases of remote surgery using non-face-to-face telehealth services are emerging one after another. Due to the absence of related standards presented to precisely handle security requirements in a non-face-to-face telehealth environment, security threats in telehealth are proceeding in a form that relies entirely on IT technology. However, the IT technology used in the medical environment is somewhat different from the existing ICT technology, so the need for a cybersecurity framework for non-face-to-face telehealth is becoming a much more important issue. This paper focuses on what needs to be considered to establish an appropriate security model in non-face-to-face telehealth.

AB  - Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) are a kind of Internet of Things (IoT) systems which are used in the healthcare domain. Nowadays, there are an abundance of wearable smart devices, either commercial or clinical, which can be used to collect vital signs and transmit the collected data to remote servers for further analysis. Remote patient monitoring, smart diagnostics, and autonomous control of chronic diseases are examples of different healthcare services that can be provided by these systems at a lower cost and higher efficiency compared to traditional healthcare settings. However, as data related to patients’ health status and treatment history, transmitted in these systems, are highly confidential and private, security and privacy concerns in their widespread adoption may arise. Deap Learning (DL) algorithms, with their ability in extracting knowledge from big data generated in these systems, can be leveraged to design smart security mechanisms. In this survey study, the recent literature on the DL-assisted security and privacy provisioning frameworks in IoMT systems are categorized and summarized with respect to their main contributions. Finally, some possible future directions are introduced to assist interested researchers to continue research in this domain.

AB  - In many developing countries, the healthcare sector is facing several challenges, mainly due to the lack of personal, institutions, and medications in public health systems. Over the past decade, information and communication technology has proved its ability to improve medical quality, reduce costs, and promote data security. Developing countries can exploit these technologies to improve the healthcare process and ensure remote health monitoring, especially in rural areas. The Internet of Things and smart medical devices are widely used to provide remote patient monitoring. Current systems are based on centralized communication with cloud servers. However, this architecture increases several security and privacy risks. The adoption of a distributed architecture is required to overcome these issues. In this article, we describe a Blockchain-based system for securing Internet-of-Things (IoT) healthcare devices. In addition to data encryption, we propose to use Blockchain technology to enhance security and privacy in healthcare systems. The system is intended to allow remote patient monitoring, particularly for chronic diseases that necessitate regular monitoring. Three important characteristics were taken into account: security, scalability, and processing time. The security concerns are ensured by using the re-encryption proxy in conjunction with Blockchain to encrypt data and control access to it. To ensure Blockchain scalability, data are stored in an InterPlanetary file system (IPFS) off-chain database. We use an Ethereum Blockchain based on proof of authority (PoA) to speed up the data storage. In comparison to existing methods, the experimental system has shown a significant improvement in the security of healthcare systems.

AB  - In India, the distribution of healthcare facilities is grossly unequal. Access to health care relies heavily on transportation, particularly in rural areas where travel distances are great and access to alternative modes such as public transit is limited. Although India has a doctor-to-patient ratio of 1:854 which is greater than the threshold recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), almost 52% of these doctors only work in five states: Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh. To bridge the gap between urban and rural India in accessing healthcare telemedicine came into existence. Telemedicine makes it possible for patients to receive medical care regardless of their location. Though there were hesitations in the beginning, in the new normal telemedicine booms across the globe. Hence, in this study, various existing telemedicine device manufacturers in India were examined. The limitation examined is that the patient monitor system manufactured by these companies does not include all the significant vitals required. Therefore, a system was proposed to track the patient 24/7 including all the necessary vitals. A deep learning model would be employed to predict the abnormality and the possible diseases. An alert system is included to alert the doctor and patient if there is any anomaly found. Hyperledger Fabric blockchain was integrated with edge computing which would be used to provide data security and further analysis.

AB  - Digital twin (DT), referring to a promising technique to digitally and accurately represent actual physical entities, has attracted explosive interests from both academia and industry. One typical advantage of DT is that it can be used to not only virtually replicate a system’s detailed operations but also analyze the current condition, predict the future behavior, and refine the control optimization. Although DT has been widely implemented in various fields, such as smart manufacturing and transportation, its conventional paradigm is limited to embody non-living entities, e.g., robots and vehicles. When adopted in human-centric systems, a novel concept, called human digital twin (HDT) has thus been proposed. Particularly, HDT allows in silico representation of individual human body with the ability to dynamically reflect molecular status, physiological status, emotional and psychological status, as well as lifestyle evolutions. These prompt the expected application of HDT in personalized healthcare (PH), which can facilitate the remote monitoring, diagnosis, prescription, surgery and rehabilitation, and hence significantly alleviate the heavy burden on the traditional healthcare system. However, despite the large potential, HDT faces substantial research challenges in different aspects, and becomes an increasingly popular topic recently. In this survey, with a specific focus on the networking architecture and key technologies for HDT in PH applications, we first discuss the differences between HDT and the conventional DTs, followed by the universal framework and essential functions of HDT. We then analyze its design requirements and challenges in PH applications. After that, we provide an overview of the networking architecture of HDT, including data acquisition layer, data communication layer, computation layer, data management layer and data analysis and decision making layer. Besides reviewing the key technologies for implementing such networking architecture in detail, we conclude this survey by presenting future research directions of HDT.

AB  - The expansion of Internet if Things (IoT) technology has led to the widespread use of sensors in various everyday environments, including healthcare. Body Sensor Networks (BSNs) enable continuous monitoring of human physiological signals and activities, benefiting healthcare and well-being. However, existing BSN systems primarily focus on single-user activity recognition, disregarding multi-user scenarios. Therefore, this paper introduces a collaborative BSN-based architecture for multi-user activity recognition to identify group collaborations among nearby users. We discuss first the general problem of multi-user activity recognition, the associated challenges along with potential solutions (such as data processing, mining techniques, sensor noise, and the complexity of multi-user activities) and, then, the software abstractions and the components of our architecture. This represents an innovative solution of collective intelligence and it holds significant potential for enhancing healthcare and well-being applications by enabling real-time detection of group activities and behaviors.

AB  - The sensitivity of data collected via ambulatory monitoring, which regularly involve the recording of speech signals and sensor information, can cause strong privacy concerns. We investigate user re-identification risk in a corpus of such data collected to observe the interplay between behavior, physiology, and well-being of healthcare workers in their daily life. We then develop a user anonymization approach that preserves well-being information (i.e., anxiety), but eliminates user identify (ID) information. We formulate this via an auto-encoder that learns a transformed version of the original feature set in an adversarial manner so that it minimizes the anxiety estimation loss and maximizes the user classification loss. Results indicate that the original features bear a large user re-identification risk, while also having a good ability to classify a user’s anxiety. After removing the most prone features to user re-identification from the original feature set, the user classification accuracy decreases, while the anxiety classification performance is preserved. The final features transformed via the auto-encoder further reduce evidence of user ID and preserve anxiety classification ability. Findings from this study can contribute to the design privacy-aware bio-behavioral models that can be used for responsible ambulatory monitoring in healthcare and beyond.

AB  - Human-Object Interaction (HOI) recognition, due to its significance in many computer vision-based applications, requires in-depth and meaningful details from image sequences. Incorporating semantics in scene understanding has led to a deep understanding of human-centric actions. Therefore, in this research work, we propose a semantic HOI recognition system based on multi-vision sensors. In the proposed system, the de-noised RGB and depth images, via Bilateral Filtering (BLF), are segmented into multiple clusters using a Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) algorithm. The skeleton is then extracted from segmented RGB and depth images via Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT). Human joints, extracted from the skeleton, provide the annotations for accurate pixel-level labeling. An elliptical human model is then generated via a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). A Conditional Random Field (CRF) model is trained to allocate a specific label to each pixel of different human body parts and an interaction object. Two semantic feature types that are extracted from each labeled body part of the human and labelled objects are: Fiducial points and 3D point cloud. Features descriptors are quantized using Fisher's Linear Discriminant Analysis (FLDA) and classified using K-ary Tree Hashing (KATH). In experimentation phase the recognition accuracy achieved with the Sports dataset is 92.88%, with the Sun Yat-Sen University (SYSU) 3D HOI dataset is 93.5% and with the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) RGB+D dataset it is 94.16%. The proposed system is validated via extensive experimentation and should be applicable to many computer-vision based applications such as healthcare monitoring, security systems and assisted living etc.

AB  - Extensive research has been dedicated to the exploration of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) to improve healthcare services. The integration of Internet of Things (IoT), medical devices and cloud computing has facilitated a synergistic approach to prevent, diagnose, treat, and manage chronic illnesses more effectively. With remote patient monitoring and real-time feedback, healthcare outcomes can be significantly improved. This Integration of technology with healthcare relies on good network connectivity, adequate bandwidth, and low latency. However, in areas with poor network connectivity, the effectiveness and reliability of these technologies may be compromised. In order to overcome these limitations Dew Computing has emerged as a new paradigm that researchers have explored in resource constrained environments. This paper aims to study the application of IoT and Dew Computing in providing innovative solutions for complementing and strengthening existing e-healthcare. We conducted a comprehensive and systematic literature review to summarize the latest information available on Dew Computing Inspired state-of-the-art frameworks in the healthcare industry. This paper emphasizes the application of Dew Computing in the context of Healthcare IoT to address the issues of restricted scalability and interoperability commonly encountered in cloud computing systems. This is achieved by conducting a thorough analysis of pertinent literature in well-known databases. The scarcity of studies that have evaluated the practical implementation of their research suggests that the application of Dew Computing in eHealth may still be in its early stages of development. This review also identifies the trends and explores potential future directions which could lead to unprecedented breakthroughs in on-demand medical services. Finally, several research challenges and open issues are discussed for further work.

AB  - The leading causes of death worldwide are chronic illnesses suchlike diabetes, Heart Disease (HD), cancer as well as chronic respiratory malady. It is remarkably intricate to diagnose HD with disparate symptoms or features. With the augmentation in popularity of smart wearable gadgets, a chance to render an Internet of Things (IoT) solution has turned out to be more. Unfortunately, the survival rates are low for the people suffering from sudden heart attacks. Consequently, a patient monitoring scheme intended for heart patients utilizing IoT centered Deep Learning Modified Neural Network (DLMNN) is proposed to assist in the HD diagnosis, and medication is given accordingly. This proposed technique is executed via `3' steps: I) Authentication, ii) Encryption, and iii) Classification. First, by utilizing the substitution cipher (SC) together with the SHA-512, the heart patient of the specific hospital is authenticated. Subsequently, the wearable IoT sensor device, which is fixed to the patient's body, concurrently transmits the sensor data to the cloud. This sensor data is encrypted and securely transmitted to the cloud utilizing the PDH-AES technique. After that, the encrypted data is finally decrypted, and by employing the DLMNN classifier, the classification is done. The classified outcomes comprise `2'types of data: i) normal and ii) abnormal. It denotes the patient's heart condition and if the outcome is abnormal, an alert text is passed to the physician for treating the patient. The investigational outcomes are estimated and the DLMNN for HD diagnosis shows improvement as compared to existing algorithms. Additionally, the proposed PDH-AES used in support of secure data transmission results in the highest level of security i.e. 95.87%, and it is achieved in the lowest time for encryption along with decryption when weighted against the existent AES.

AB  - This paper introduces a hardware-efficient approach utilizing Lightweight Cryptography (LWC) within a Multiple-Input Multiple-Output Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) system for secure transmission of Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals in wireless health monitoring. Privacy and security concerns are addressed by integrating LWC to safeguard patient identification and medical records during transmission. Leveraging gate-level architecture and simplified key scheduling, LWC minimizes logical elements, enhancing FPGA resource utilization, particularly suited for low-cost implementations on Spartan FPGAs. Additionally, turbo coding mitigates errors caused by burst errors and inter-syllable interference (ISI). Using ECG signals from the MIT arrhythmia database, performance evaluation of the proposed LWC-MIMO-OFDM method includes area, delay, power consumption, and FPGA resource utilization metrics such as slices, flip-flops, and Look-Up Tables (LUTs). Comparative analysis with Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) showcases the efficiency of LWC-MIMO-OFDM, with the Spartan FPGA implementation demonstrating reduced delay, further emphasizing its suitability for cost-effective deployments in wireless health monitoring systems.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is a modern technology that connects physical objects in a given environment over the Internet to make their information available from everywhere and at any time. The popularity of IoT technologies is rapidly increasing in most areas, such as education, health, agriculture, transportation, etc. Medical Body Area Network (MBAN) is an emerging healthcare technology that allows remote monitoring of patient's vital signs, providing physicians with real-time data and facilitating better treatment decisions. However, security concerns are one of the hardest things to solve in IoT systems because they have limited computing power, memory, and energy, among other things. Moreover, all the objects in the IoT system are communicated with, controlled, and monitored over the Internet, and most communications are established via wireless networks. Due to the weakness of the wireless network, it is essential to protect data so that a bad guy can't get to it. This article proposes a model based on a lightweight cryptographic protocol to ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and device authentication for MBAN patients. Experimental evaluations show that the proposed approach is functional with the currently available hardware resources to provide complete cryptographic functionalities, like ensuring patient physiological data confidentiality and upholding data integrity during the exchange between sensor devices and the central coordinator. Also, unauthorized access attempts from malicious devices or attackers are detected through mutual authentication to maintain the integrity of data sources.

AB  - Device-free human activity recognition (DF-HAR) has attracted considerable attention in recent times owing to its promising applications in healthcare monitoring, smart home, and security systems. WiFi channel state information (CSI) has emerged as a promising approach for DF-HAR, as it provides valuable insights into the changes in the radio signal caused by human movements. In this paper, we explore the use of WiFi CSI for DF-HAR and propose a system that utilizes WiFi CSI to reliably recognize human activities without the need for sensors or wearable devices. Our system leverages the rich information available in WiFi CSI and employs advanced signal processing techniques to achieve high reliability in device-free human activity recognition Our experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach and its potential for application in various real-world scenarios.

AB  - Due to employee carelessness or negligence, accidents are frequently happening to workers in feeders. The person working in the Feeder will be impacted by the mal operation of the isolators (Double Pole Switch). To avoid this accident and safeguard the employee from undesired operation, fingerprint sensors are added to isolator’s yard (air brake switch/double pole switch) to avoid accidents (Someone is operating the circuit breaker or Isolator with a duplicate key without informing the operator who is at work). To operate the isolator, only authorized individuals are allowed in the yard. IoT will also notify the office manager or control room of the circuit breaker or isolator's activity. To transmit the data to the control room, a sensor is provided in the yard. This is the greatest approach to avoid accidents, especially in the rural or isolated areas. In this case, IoT is being used to tell the control room of the operator's operational feeder status. Power from the Photovoltaic cells is used to energize the IoT module which is fixed in the yard. So it need not to depend on feeder supply.
