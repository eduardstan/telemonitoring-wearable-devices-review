AB  - Automatic electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis for pacemaker patients is crucial for monitoring cardiac conditions and the effectiveness of cardiac resynchronization treatment. However, under the condition of energy-saving remote monitoring, the low-sampling-rate issue of an ECG device can lead to the miss detection of pacemaker spikes as well as incorrect analysis on paced rhythm and non-paced arrhythmias. To solve the issue, this paper proposed a novel system that applies the compressive sampling (CS) framework to sub-Nyquist acquire and reconstruct ECG, and then uses multi-dimensional feature-based deep learning to identify paced rhythm and non-paced arrhythmias. Simulation testing results on ECG databases and comparison with existing approaches demonstrate its effectiveness and outstanding performance for pacemaker ECG analysis.

AB  - Over the years, the popularity and usage of wearable Internet of Things (IoT) devices in several healthcare services are increased. Among the services that benefit from the usage of such devices is predictive analysis, which can improve early diagnosis in e-health. However, due to the limitations of wearable IoT devices, challenges in data privacy, service integrity, and network structure adaptability arose. To address these concerns, we propose a platform using federated learning and private blockchain technology within a fog-IoT network. These technologies have privacy-preserving features securing data within the network. We utilized the fog-IoT network’s distributive structure to create an adaptive network for wearable IoT devices. We designed a testbed to examine the proposed platform’s ability to preserve the integrity of a classifier. According to experimental results, the introduced implementation can effectively preserve a patient’s privacy and a predictive service’s integrity. We further investigated the contributions of other technologies to the security and adaptability of the IoT network. Overall, we proved the feasibility of our platform in addressing significant security and privacy challenges of wearable IoT devices in predictive healthcare through analysis, simulation, and experimentation.

AB  - This paper outlines the development of a wearable device to measure knee joint flexion angles and compares its performance to a computer vision based human pose model. The objective is to advance techniques used in measuring joint flexion angles, which have several drawbacks such as relying heavily on the clinician for accuracy while also being invasive as they require physical contact between the patient and orthopaedic specialist. The proposed implementations integrate digital innovation in orthopaedic healthcare while being affordable and easy to deploy, making them marketable to clinicians and patients in developing countries. To evaluate the workability of the implementations, knee flexion angle measurements of a test subject were obtained using both techniques which yielded consistent and comparable flexion angle readings. Further development of this work can have a significant impact on the accessibility and affordability of innovative healthcare monitoring technologies, especially for patients in developing countries.

AB  - The successful development of a diagnosis system to identify diabetes in the Internet of Things (IoT) e-healthcare scenario has gained considerable attention to implement accurate diabetes diagnosis. IoT is playing an increasingly important role in healthcare environment by providing a structure for evaluating medical information to detect diseases via data mining techniques. The existing diagnostic methods have some challenges, such as lengthy calculation times and inaccurate predictions. To evade the limitations, this article suggested an IOT-based diagnosis system that uses Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Through the dataset from UCI Repository with medical sensors, a novel systematic technique is utilized to treat diabetic disease, and relevant medical data is produced to precisely predict those who would be seriously impacted by the condition. For predicting the illness and its severity, a brand-new classification technique called Tuna Swarm optimization-Aided Neural Classifier (TSO-NN) is suggested (T. The experimentation is conducted in MATLAB and the performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, and F1-score. Besides, the efficiency is tested and confirmed by comparing over SOTA methods.

AB  - Understanding and integrating physiological data collected from wearable sensors in remote patient monitoring (RPM) is challenging. Data streams may be interrupted due to the sensor’s sensitivity, movement, and electromagnetic interference leading to inconsistent, missing, and inaccurate data. Existing approaches to summarize data flows into a single score such as the traditional Modified early warning score (MEWS) is limited. Data visualization approaches have the potential to address this challenge, but few studies have focused on visualization of RPM streams. The study presents a transformation of observed raw RPM physiological data into parameters identified as trust, frequency, slope, and trend. This facilitated visualization and enabled automated assessments of prioritized alerts. Experimental results have shown that the transformations led to the prioritization of clinically significant conditions, and improved visualization has the potential to better support clinical decisions compared with traditional MEWS.

AB  - Fall detection is a major issue in public healthcare, particularly for the elderly. When their physical condition deteriorates, prompt and dependable care is necessary to mitigate the negative impacts of cascade. The current system, designed by others, is incapable of detecting false falls and lacks a health analysis system. The proposed system monitors a person's activity, employs an effective quaternion algorithm to detect a deviation from typical diurnal conditioning, and then automatically transmits a request for assistance along with the case's location to the carers. These models were initially developed to distinguish fall from daily movements such as walking, moving, sitting, standing, reclining, and bending.

AB  - This article introduces an advanced vital sign monitoring system that seamlessly integrates sensor technology, wireless communication, and machine learning (ML) algorithms to enhance patient care. The system accurately records and interprets vital physiological metrics such as oxygen saturation (SpO2), heart rate (HR), and body temperature. The integration forms the foundation of our comprehensive approach to patient health status classification through the ML algorithm. We employed three distinct ML algorithms—K-nearest neighbors (KNNs), support vector machines (SVMs), and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) models to analyze health states, each precisely trained and validated using data collected from sensors on vital sign. This meticulous training aims to enable the models to accurately identify various patient health states, with the KNN model achieving an average accuracy of 92%, while the SVM and SGD models attained even higher accuracies of 94% and 97%, respectively. These outcomes were rigorously validated against established health scoring systems, showcasing the models’ exceptional performance in multiclass classification scenarios. This is further evidenced by their area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) scores: KNN (0.9021), SVM (0.9841), and SGD (0.9933). The integration of these technologies into our health monitoring system represents a significant advancement in the continuous and comprehensive assessment of patient health, demonstrating the potential of modern technologies to revolutionize healthcare monitoring and management.

AB  - An embedded system that integrates hardware and software has been designed to perform specific tasks, utilizing machine learning and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. The IoT refers to the extension of Internet connectivity to everyday objects, enabling them to be interacted with and communicated among each other over the Internet. These smart devices, equipped with sensors and Internet connectivity, can be monitored and controlled remotely. In this study, a smart glove that collects and processes users' vital body readings through integrated sensors is presented. The data is then transmitted to MATLAB via an Arduino hardware package. To predict whether the user's body condition is normal or abnormal, machine learning algorithms, specifically the K-Nearest Neighbor classifier, are applied using the collected testing data. Based on the prediction, a prescription is generated, and a message regarding the user's health status is received by the user. In comparison to the existing RFID Tag Reader system, several advantages are offered by our proposed solution. It allows individualized monitoring of users and the granting of a separate login to each user. Additionally, the proposed system's compact size makes it more practical for everyday use. Furthermore, the efficiency of the proposed system surpasses that of the traditional RFID Tag Reader system. By harnessing the power of machine learning and IoT, personalized health monitoring is provided by our smart glove system, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency and effectiveness of remote health monitoring systems.

AB  - In recent years, significant advancements in the area of non-invasive and wearable technology have paved the way for widespread applications of personalized and remote health monitoring. Health monitoring enables proactive management of one's well-being, and enhances overall health outcomes. With the advent of such technologies there are lots of platforms developed. But such platforms are not successful in providing the followings: 1) the ability to monitor all major health vitals in one unified application, & 2) the provision of a holistic health score derived from these non-invasive vitals for fitness measurement. In response, this paper presents a novel solution featuring: 1) An IoT-ML enabled platform for self-monitoring of important health vitals, and 2) A fitness assessment score derived through ML algorithm using the health vitals of a person. By integrating data on various health parameters including heart rate, blood oxygen levels, and sleep patterns, advanced machine learning models are developed to analyze this data and predict the fitness score that accurately reflects an individual's overall health and fitness level. The performance of the proposed estimation model is evaluated using R2 and mean square error (MSE) and the best value is achieved using the XGBoost regressor of values 0.967 and 0.0033. This solution empowers individuals to take control of their well-being and improve their overall quality of life. Overall, the integration of non-invasive methods and IoT sensors for health vitals monitoring and fitness assessment presents a novel approach with significant potential to revolutionize health care. By empowering individuals with real-time insights and a comprehensive fitness score, this solution facilitates informed decision-making and enables individuals to proactively manage their health and well-being, ultimately enhancing their overall quality of life.

AB  - Heart failure is a growing concern due to its high incidence nowadays, also representing a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In this paper we propose a web-based platform that incorporates both the clinical data prediction aspect and the continuous monitoring of the heart health. We implement multiple machine learning models that can support the doctors in the process of classification between a healthy and unhealthy situation. The platform benefits from an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) sub-system that processes biometric data from smart wearables and displays it in customizable dashboards for a more illustrative visualization. The prediction service integrates three Machine Learning (ML) techniques, namely Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes Classifier, and a custom Artificial Neural Network responsible for making classifications on the monitored data. The results illustrate that the proposed solution’s usage for performing remote monitoring and heart health assessment is feasible, obtaining promising accuracies with the aid of a public heart failure dataset (best accuracy of 88.5%).

AB  - Designing, producing, and implementing biosensors and monitoring vital signals is one of the necessities of today’s technologies. In this article, a special monitoring module with a rechargeable battery power source and a software-based expandable platform on the web server for displaying and monitoring the Wearable Artificial Kidney (WAK) signals graphically, is presented. The proposed system, monitors and controls the performance of the device remotely, and it provides a reduction in costs and time savings. By implementing a hardware module, the vital and control signals are received from WAK sensors and using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol are sent. The proposed module can send the data by WIFI and GSM/GPRS. The desired module, while controlling WAK remotely, is equipped with a GPS that controls the geographic location of patients. To reduce the power consumption of this battery-powered module, it sends the location in a part-time performance cycle. The proposed method, utilized artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm, to monitor the performance of the WAK and provide suitable control according to each patient’s condition. Also, the AI algorithm utilizes the significant measured parameters of the sensors such as blood leakage and air bubble detectors, access, return, pre-filter and ultra-filter pressures, temperature, pump status, and battery level, leading to early detection and interventions to avoid hospitalizations that facilitate the management and increase the quality of the dialysis patients.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases have increased in the graph over the past few years worldwide. Annually, it is estimated that coronary heart disease (CHD) kills approximately 382,820 people in the world. According to statistics, in the year 2022 around 200 million people are living with coronary heart disease thus, prevention and detection of CVD are important. According to surveys, India will have more cardiac patients than any other nation by the year 2023. Thus, electrocardiograms, which are used to monitor the electrical activity of the heart, are more of a need than a pleasure. Remote vital sign monitoring systems have become a promising solution to detect and prevent heart attacks. This study proposes a health monitoring system that utilizes wearable devices to collect and analyze data on the vital signs of heart attack patients continuously. The system also incorporates machine-learning algorithms to analyze the data, identify patterns and anomalies, and generate real-time alerts for healthcare professionals in case of any abnormalities. The proposed system can be a valuable tool in preventing and detecting heart attacks and has the potential to revolutionize how healthcare professionals monitor and treat heart attack patients.

Healthcare technology is one of the most popular studies in recent years. people's lifespans have successfully extended with the development of healthcare facilities and technologies. However, people in rural areas still have difficulty in obtaining healthcare services due to the barrier of distance and lack of doctors. The present work provides one of the best solutions to overcome this issue. During the pandemic situation, mortality was observed due to a lack of doctors and infrastructure as the patient-to-doctor ratio was more. The proposed experiment helps to overcome these problems. The data collected from various sensors are sent to the cloud and prediction along with a diagnosis of the patient are implemented. Algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Extreme Gradient Boosting are being compared to obtain maximum accuracy. The Random Forest model is providing good accuracy for the prediction of a patient's condition compared to other algorithms.

AB  - The dramatic progresses of wireless technologies and wearable devices have significantly promoted the development and popularity of smart home, while digital twin (DT) emerges as a game changer benefiting from its enhanced capabilities of visualization and interaction. The DT is able to build a realtime and continuous visual replica of a physical object or process, and to provide realtime monitoring, anomaly prediction, smart interaction, and lifecycle management. This paper presents a DT model to empower healthcare monitoring in the smart home with the goals of graphical monitoring, healthcare prediction, and intelligent control. High fidelity DT of the house and its equipments is created for visualized monitoring, and two suites of devices are deployed for continuously acquiring the users’ electrocardiograph (ECG) waves and the WiFi signals in the house. Two intelligent algorithms are then developed to perform fall detection from WiFi signals and to screen atrial fibrillation from ECG waves collected by wearable devices. Experimental results well validate the proposed model’s effectiveness for smart home monitoring, and the advantages of the developed smart algorithms for healthcare prediction over counterparts.

AB  - In today’s world, everyone’s health is a major concern and a top priority. Humans are afflicted with a plethora of diseases because of their unhealthy habits. People are primarily affected by heart attacks and low oxygen levels because of poor medical care and late diagnosis. As a result, this work aims to combat such untimely deaths using smart health monitoring, which employs machine learning and IoT. The proposed system includes ThingSpeak cloud to communicate with the doctor in case of any emergency. This system consists of body temperature sensor, pulse oximeter sensor (for collecting heartbeat rate and oxygen level) and blood pressure sensing module for tracking patient’s health. These sensors are interfaced with the Raspberry pi and Arduino Uno microcontroller. The obtained result from patients is continuously monitored and it is updated in LCD and doctor’s webpage using Internet of Things. Following these steps, a trained Machine Learning model is used to determine the type of disease being experienced by the patient. This system predicts Normal and two major disease namely Hypertension and Lung disease. By incorporating all these features, we can ensure that people who suffer from heart attacks and lung disease will not die suddenly. The accuracy of this proposed method is 86% approximately in a real time scenario. Furthermore, because raw medical data can be analyzed in a short period of time, the work will aid clinicians in remote monitoring during epidemic situations such as covid.

AB  - In the latest days, study into the development of intelligent technologies has proven valuable, contributing to attempts to improve the quality of human existence. Smart glass is one of the intelligent wearable devices that can be used for various purposes, including healthcare monitoring, fall detection, sleep tracking, and human activity recognition (HAR). Smart-phones and smartwatches are the primary wearables utilized in sensor-based HAR to collect human motions for training recognition models based on physical movement. These wearable tools, nevertheless, are more intrusive than smart glasses. Using IMU sensor data acquired via smart glasses, we investigate deep learning algorithms for detecting people's activities of daily living (ADL). This work proposes a hybrid deep neural network that automatically extracts spatial-temporal information from raw data to enhance identification $\mathbf{p}$ erformance. We performed tests to evaluate deep learning models using a publically available benchmark dataset, UCA-EHAR, which included IMU sensor data from multiple ADL from smart eyewear. The recommended CNN-LSTM model achieved the best effectiveness with the highest F1-score of 93.20%, as determined by experimental findings.

AB  - Wearable sensors and the data they gather are becoming more popular, which will hopefully lead to improvements in diagnostic methods and overall quality of life. The patient may take early preventative action if they know that their vital signs are being monitored regularly. There is a pressing need to close the gap between conventional medical practice and cutting-edge scientific development in order to speed up patient care. Since the worldwide epidemic, healthcare monitoring systems have seen massive growth in their user base. With the use of IoT, healthcare may shift from being primarily based on hospitals to being shared between hospitals and patients' homes. The practice of profile monitoring is becoming more common in the quality assurance industry. When it comes to making predictions, machine learning clearly outperforms traditional conditional flow of programs. This is true across a broad variety of use cases, from predicting the weather to detecting fraud in a network. However, a bigger data set is required for model training with each gain in prediction accuracy, which in turn raises the requirement for faster hardware and greater processing capacity. As a result, you can only use regular computers or the cloud to run your ML models. The purpose of this work is to implement a linear regression-based machine learning model on a low-power microcontroller for use in IoT-based wearables for health prediction.

AB  - In many sectors, including healthcare services, Internet of Things (IoT) systems are growing rapidly, providing promising technological, economical, and social potential. Healthcare services can be improved with IoT capabilities, including remote patient monitoring, diagnosis of medical issues in real-time, and more, all of which improves both the quality and the satisfaction of human users. The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is gaining momentum as wearable devices, and their numerous health monitoring applications increase popularity. The IoMT plays a significant role in reducing death rates by detecting diseases early. Prediction of heart disease is an essential challenge in clinical dataset analysis. The proposed research aim is to employ machine learning (ML) classification algorithms to predict heart disease. The IoMT-based cloud-fog diagnostics for heart disease have been proposed. Fog layer is used to quickly analyze patient data using ML classification techniques. The performance of the healthcare model is evaluated with different simulations and achieves 97.32% accuracy, 97.58% recall, 97.16% precision, 97.37%  $F1$ -measure, 96.87% specificity, and 97.22%  $G$ -mean, which has significant improvement as compared with previous models.

AB  - The management of people with long-term or chronic illness is one of the biggest challenges for national health systems. In fact, these diseases are among the leading causes of hospitalization, especially for the elderly, and huge amount of resources required to monitor them leads to problems with sustainability of the healthcare systems. The increasing diffusion of portable devices and new connectivity technologies allows the implementation of telemonitoring system capable of providing support to health care providers and lighten the burden on hospitals and clinics. In this paper, we present the implementation of a telemonitoring platform for healthcare, designed to capture several types of physiological health parameters from different consumer mobile and custom devices. Consumer medical devices can be integrated into the platform via the Google Fit ecosystem that supports hundreds of devices, while custom devices can directly interact with the platform with standard communication protocols. The platform is designed to process the acquired data using machine learning algorithms, and to provide patients and physicians the physiological health parameters with a user-friendly, comprehensive, and easy to understand dashboard which monitors the parameters through time. Preliminary usabil-ity tests show a good user satisfaction in terms of functionality and usefulness.

AB  - Continuous monitoring of stress in individuals during their daily activities has become an inevitable need in present times. Unattended stress is a silent killer and may lead to fatal physical and mental disorders if left unidentified. Stress identification based on individual judgement often leads to under-diagnosis and delayed treatment possibilities. EEG-based stress monitoring is quite popular in this context, but impractical to use for continuous remote monitoring.Continuous remote monitoring of stress using signals acquired from everyday wearables like smart watches is the best alternative here. Non-EEG data such as heart rate and ectodermal activity can also act as indicators of physiological stress. In this work, we have explored the possibility of using nonlinear features from non-EEG data such as (a) heart rate, (b) ectodermal activity, (c) body temperature (d) SpO2 and (e) acceleration in detecting four different types of neurological states; namely (1) Relaxed state, (2) State of Physical stress, (3) State of Cognitive stress and (4) State of Emotional stress. Physiological data of 20 healthy adults have been used from the noneeg database of PhysioNet.Results: We used two machine learning models; a linear logistic regression and a nonlinear random forest to detect (a) stress from relaxed state and (4) the four different neurological states. We trained the models using linear and nonlinear features separately. For the 2-class and 4-class problems, using nonlinear features increased the accuracy of the models. Moreover, it is also proved in this study that by using nonlinear features, we can avoid the use of complex machine learning models.

AB  - To date, the novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has infected millions and has caused the deaths of thousands of people around the world. At the moment, five antibodies, two from China, two from the U.S., and one from the UK, have already been widely utilized and numerous vaccines are under the trail process. In order to reach herd immunity, around 70% of the population would need to be inoculated. It may take several years to hinder the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Governments and concerned authorities have taken stringent measurements such as enforcing partial, complete, or smart lockdowns, building temporary medical facilities, advocating social distancing, and mandating masks in public as well as setting up awareness campaigns. Furthermore, there have been massive efforts in various research areas and a wide variety of tools, technologies and techniques have been explored and developed to combat the war against this pandemic. Interestingly, machine learning (ML) algorithms and internet of Things (IoTs) technology are the pioneers in this race. Up till now, several real-time and intelligent IoT-based COVID-19 diagnosing, and monitoring systems have been proposed to tackle the pandemic. In this article we have analyzed a wide range of IoTs technologies which can be used in diagnosing and monitoring the infected individuals and hotspot areas. Furthermore, we identify the challenges and also provide our vision about the future research on COVID-19.

AB  - Wearable sensor-based devices are increasingly applied in free-living and clinical settings to collect fine-grained, objective data about activity and sleep behavior. The manufacturers of these devices provide proprietary software that labels the sensor data at specified time intervals with activity and sleep information. If the device wearer has a health condition affecting their movement, such as a stroke, these labels and their values can vary greatly from manufacturer to manufacturer. Consequently, generating outcome predictions based on data collected from patients attending inpatient rehabilitation wearing different sensor devices can be challenging, which hampers usefulness of these data for patient care decisions. In this article, we present a data-driven approach to combining datasets collected from different device manufacturers. With the ability to combine datasets, we merge data from three different device manufacturers to form a larger dataset of time series data collected from 44 patients receiving inpatient therapy services. To gain insights into the recovery process, we use this dataset to build models that predict a patient's next day physical activity duration and next night sleep duration. Using our data-driven approach and the combined dataset, we obtained a normalized root mean square error prediction of 9.11% for daytime physical activity and 11.18% for nighttime sleep duration. Our sleep result is comparable to the accuracy we achieved using the manufacturer's sleep labels (12.26%). Our device-independent predictions are suitable for both point-of-care and remote monitoring applications to provide information to clinicians for customizing therapy services and potentially decreasing recovery time.

AB  - The current pandemic and the expansion of insurance coverage of telehealth for the elderly has shown the need for improvements in the automation of medical services and behavioral monitoring. Elderly individuals at home or in senior centers typically contact their physicians once a serious medical condition is obvious. There are very few systems with automated means of monitoring the health of individuals recovering from an injury or monitoring their progress when conducting telerehabilitation using wearables, remote cameras, and the cloud. To address these automation and long-term health monitoring issues, we have developed a multi-modal platform that employs common, low-cost wearables, and teleconferencing tools that takes advantage of cloud streaming services. One modality is based on Visual IoT and edge devices that automatically connect as teleconferencing clients to record human subjects’ telerehabilitation and teletreatment sessions and push these recordings to cloud storage. We performed experiments applying two different deep learning models to the cloud video streams to track whole-body skeleton motion or to detect hand keypoints during telerehabilitation. The rehabilitation maybe associated with recovery from a stroke or other similar incident. The other modality of our platform includes an Apple Watch ® App that pushes users’ physiological and kinematic data to the cloud and automatically generates data analytics dashboards for use by clinicians. Both, the wearables-based and the Visual IoT-based modalities complement each other in telerehabilitation or teletreatment controlled by clinicians. These modalities can also work together in sessions without the need for controlled (uncontrolled) telemonitoring. Our multimodality, cloud-based architecture shows very promising applications in automatic behavioral analytics, especially for elderly individuals with limited social contact that would benefit from telerehabilitation, or continuous telemonitoring.

The technological advancements, such as wearable wireless devices, the Internet of Things, and improved machine learning methods have made these systems more reliable. In modern times, these systems can play a vital role in post-rehabilitation journeys, which have significant social impact and high costs in traditional settings. Cost efficiency, portability, and generalization are key factors in adopting new technology. In this study, we investigate the potential for optimizing and simplifying hardware in order to increase the cost-effectiveness and versatility of post-stroke eHealth rehabilitation systems. It leverages the rich information available from Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors to compensate the need for foot pressure sensing. We present the first attempt to demonstrate the potential of machine learning, aided by affordable off the shelf motion sensing devices, for foot pressure analysis. Our proposed foot pressure decoding model is trained in an exercise-agnostic, self-supervised manner that eliminates the need for human annotation. The algorithm is evaluated using appropriate performance metrics, and our experimental results show very promising performance.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) systems are valid solutions for remote health monitoring. The combination of technology and network with medical knowledge leads to important telemedicine solutions. Telemedicine is the practice of medical care where patient and providers are separated by distance. Telemonitoring of chronic diseases is one of the most important aspects of telemedicine. Chronic diseases such as chronic venous disease and diabetic foot require continuous monitoring in order to prevent complications, which can become very burdensome, with variations in plantar pressures, deformations, ulcers, up to amputations. The quality of life of those suffering from these diseases is strongly affected and furthermore the continuous monitoring causes great expenses for the health system. We propose an IoT infrastructure for the screening and recognition of patients suffering from phlebopathic disease, based on the use of a smart sock. The smart sock integrates pressure sensors and inertial sensors, worn by patients during a dynamic test. The main contribution of this work is the development of machine learning models on the collected and processed data of a sample population of 24 participants, 13 healthy and 11 suffering from phlebopathic diseases. The best classifier obtained shows very good performance, with an accuracy of 95.83%, high precision, recall and a F1-Score equal to 0.95, making the proposed framework a good candidate as system for screening phlebopathic patients and for their early diagnosis.

AB  - The significant morbidity and death rates associated with sepsis indicate that it is still an important health care concern. Wearable technologies, cloud computing, and logistic regression predictive analytics are proposed as unique techniques to identify sepsis early on in this research. Wearable sensors continuously monitor physiological parameters, collecting real-time data and sending it to the cloud for analysis. A logistic regression model trained using prior patient data can analyze the incoming data and predict the chance of sepsis development. The cloud's scalability, adaptability, and real-time processing communicate the necessity for quick interventions. The predictive analytics method shows some encouraging accuracy in spotting the first symptoms of sepsis and alerting doctors just in time.

AB  - This pilot study aimed to predict exercise exertion levels from physiological data collected from wearable devices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). During a 16-minute cycling exercise, real-time ECG, pulse rate, oxygen saturation, and revolutions per minute (RPM) data were collected at three intensity levels. In addition, the study subjects' ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) were gathered once per minute throughout each exercise session. Each 16-minute exercise session was further divided into eight 2-minute windows. Based on the self-reported RPEs, each 2-minute window was labeled as either “high exertion” or “low exertion” classes. RPMs, heart rate, and oxygen saturation levels were averaged for each window to form the predictive features. In addition, collected ECG data were used to extract the heart rate variability (HRV) features in both the temporal and frequency domains. We used the minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) algorithm to select the best predictive features. The top selected features were then used to train and test the LSTM classifier to predict the next window's exertion level. The designed classifier showed the training accuracy of 85.7% and the testing accuracy of 78.6%. This pilot study shows the potential of a deep learning classifier to track perceived exercise exertion automatically in real-time.

AB  - The rise in chronic diseases and the aging of the population led to an increase in the demand for remote healthcare systems that employ biosensors to monitor people’s health status. The increasing need for these automated systems has led to the emergence of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) networks. In the IoMT networks, the biosensor devices collect vital signs and transmit them to the gateway for further analysis and fusion. In light of the limited biosensor device resources (power, storage, and computation) and the periodical transmission of a large amount of data, it is necessary to optimize the transmission of data in order to conserve power while maintaining data quality at the gateway. Also, it became important to have a decision-making-based machine learning model at the gateway to evaluate a patient’s health and make a quick, accurate decision in case of an emergency. This article proposes multibiosensor data sampling and transmission reduction with decision-making (MuDaSaTReD) for remote patient monitoring in the IoMT networks. The MuDaSaTReD achieves this goal on two levels: biosensors and a fog gateway. It uses an energy-saving lightweight data transmission (ELiDaT) algorithm to get rid of the repeated data and then adapts the sampling rate of each biosensor using an adaptive data sampling (ADaS) algorithm. The Multibiosensor Data Sampling and Transmission Reduction with Decision-making (MuDaFuDeC) implements the machine learning model at the fog gateway to learn and decide the situation of the patient according to the received data from the biosensors. The performance evaluation shows that the MuDaFuDeC outperforms other approaches in terms of the data reduction percentage and energy consumption. It keeps a good representation of all the scores at the fog gateway and makes automated, fast, and accurate decisions based on the patient’s condition.

AB  - With the rapid growth of edge-assisted solutions in Internet of Things (IoT) networks, connected healthcare progressively relies on such solutions. This refers to systems in which all the healthcare stakeholders are connected to each other. These systems employ novel technologies, such as IoT, edge computing, and artificial intelligence (AI) to convert conventional health systems to more effective, appropriate, and customized intelligent systems. However, such systems encounter many restrictions and require new policies. By moving the computation and processing closer to the data sources and end-users, fog becomes edge computing which can reduce latency, bandwidth usage, and energy consumption. To the best of our knowledge, there is no systematic and methodological research in this scope that investigates the existing studies considering various vital and relevant factors. Thus, this survey aims to examine the state-of-the-art research in this area. We have reviewed a significant number of papers in this area and divided them into two main taxonomies, patient-centric and process-centric techniques. Furthermore, essential factors, such as available data sets and parameters like accuracy, mobility, and data rates are described and examined. Our aim is to bridge the gap between edge computing and connected healthcare solutions by discussing the challenges and highlighting future trends.

AB  - Healthcare is an area of concern where the application of human-centred design practices and principles can enormously affect well-being and patient care. The provision of high-quality healthcare services requires a deep understanding of patients’ needs, experiences, and preferences. Human activity recognition (HAR) is paramount in healthcare monitoring by using machine learning (ML), sensor data, and artificial intelligence (AI) to track and discern individuals’ behaviours and physical movements. This technology allows healthcare professionals to remotely monitor patients, thereby ensuring they adhere to prescribed rehabilitation or exercise routines, and identify falls or anomalies, improving overall care and safety of the patient. HAR for healthcare monitoring, driven by deep learning (DL) algorithms, leverages neural networks and large quantities of sensor information to autonomously and accurately detect and track patients’ behaviors and physical activities. DL-based HAR provides a cutting-edge solution for healthcare professionals to provide precise and more proactive interventions, reducing the burden on healthcare systems and improving patient well-being while increasing the overall quality of care. Therefore, the study presents an improved coyote optimization algorithm with a deep learning-assisted HAR (ICOADL-HAR) approach for healthcare monitoring. The purpose of the ICOADL-HAR technique is to analyze the sensor information of the patients to determine the different kinds of activities. In the primary stage, the ICOADL-HAR model allows a data normalization process using the Z-score approach. For activity recognition, the ICOADL-HAR technique employs an attention-based long short-term memory (ALSTM) model. Finally, the hyperparameter tuning of the ALSTM model can be performed by using ICOA. The stimulation validation of the ICOADL-HAR model takes place using benchmark HAR datasets. The wide-ranging comparison analysis highlighted the improved recognition rate of the ICOADL-HAR method compared to other existing HAR approaches in terms of various measures.

AB  - In India, the distribution of healthcare facilities is grossly unequal. Access to health care relies heavily on transportation, particularly in rural areas where travel distances are great and access to alternative modes such as public transit is limited. Although India has a doctor-to-patient ratio of 1:854 which is greater than the threshold recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), almost 52% of these doctors only work in five states: Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh. To bridge the gap between urban and rural India in accessing healthcare telemedicine came into existence. Telemedicine makes it possible for patients to receive medical care regardless of their location. Though there were hesitations in the beginning, in the new normal telemedicine booms across the globe. Hence, in this study, various existing telemedicine device manufacturers in India were examined. The limitation examined is that the patient monitor system manufactured by these companies does not include all the significant vitals required. Therefore, a system was proposed to track the patient 24/7 including all the necessary vitals. A deep learning model would be employed to predict the abnormality and the possible diseases. An alert system is included to alert the doctor and patient if there is any anomaly found. Hyperledger Fabric blockchain was integrated with edge computing which would be used to provide data security and further analysis.

AB  - The leading causes of death worldwide are chronic illnesses suchlike diabetes, Heart Disease (HD), cancer as well as chronic respiratory malady. It is remarkably intricate to diagnose HD with disparate symptoms or features. With the augmentation in popularity of smart wearable gadgets, a chance to render an Internet of Things (IoT) solution has turned out to be more. Unfortunately, the survival rates are low for the people suffering from sudden heart attacks. Consequently, a patient monitoring scheme intended for heart patients utilizing IoT centered Deep Learning Modified Neural Network (DLMNN) is proposed to assist in the HD diagnosis, and medication is given accordingly. This proposed technique is executed via `3' steps: I) Authentication, ii) Encryption, and iii) Classification. First, by utilizing the substitution cipher (SC) together with the SHA-512, the heart patient of the specific hospital is authenticated. Subsequently, the wearable IoT sensor device, which is fixed to the patient's body, concurrently transmits the sensor data to the cloud. This sensor data is encrypted and securely transmitted to the cloud utilizing the PDH-AES technique. After that, the encrypted data is finally decrypted, and by employing the DLMNN classifier, the classification is done. The classified outcomes comprise `2'types of data: i) normal and ii) abnormal. It denotes the patient's heart condition and if the outcome is abnormal, an alert text is passed to the physician for treating the patient. The investigational outcomes are estimated and the DLMNN for HD diagnosis shows improvement as compared to existing algorithms. Additionally, the proposed PDH-AES used in support of secure data transmission results in the highest level of security i.e. 95.87%, and it is achieved in the lowest time for encryption along with decryption when weighted against the existent AES.

AB  - With the widespread adoption of wearable devices in our daily lives, the demand and appeal for remote patient monitoring have significantly increased. Most research in this field has concentrated on collecting sensor data, visualizing it, and analyzing it to detect anomalies in specific diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and depression. However, this domain has a notable gap in the aspect of human-machine interaction. This paper proposes REMONI, an autonomous REmote health MONItoring system that integrates multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the Internet of Things (loT), and wearable devices. The system automatically and continuously collects vital signs, accelerometer data from a special wearable (such as a smartwatch), and visual data in patient video clips collected from cameras. This data is processed by an anomaly detection module, which includes a fall detection model and algorithms to identify and alert caregivers of the patient's emergency conditions. A distinctive feature of our proposed system is the natural lan-guage processing component, developed with MLLMs capable of detecting and recognizing a patient's activity and emotion while responding to healthcare worker's inquiries. Additionally, prompt engineering is employed to integrate all patient information seamlessly. As a result, doctors and nurses can access real-time vital signs and the patient's current state and mood by interacting with an intelligent agent through a user-friendly web application. Our experiments demonstrate that our system is implementable and scalable for real-life scenarios, potentially reducing the workload of medical professionals and healthcare costs. A full-fledged prototype illustrating the functionalities of the system has been developed and being tested to demonstrate the robustness of its various capabilities.

AB  - The rise of smart health technologies has offered benefits such as remote patient monitoring, personalized therapy, and early disease detection. However this advancement has also raised concerns about security and privacy of patient data. Authentication is essential for protecting patient data and smart health devices. The existing scheme is identified with security vulnerabilities in terms of stolen verifier, impersonation, and man in middle attacks. Motivated by this, authors have presented a secure, lightweight authentication technique for smart health environments for a remote monitoring scenario employing a Multiple Factor approach and a lightweight algorithm. The scheme is verified through formal and informal analysis. The scheme demonstrated enhanced authentication performance and security with processing overhead of (0.04 milliseconds) and transmission overhead of (704 bits), in comparison to the baseline scheme. This system has the potential to improve data security and privacy in a variety of smart health scenarios.

AB  - Wearable sensors are often used to assist with the healthcare of elderly people within their own homes for detecting incidents such as falls. However, wearable sensors cause numerous issues: they are uncomfortable, they are often forgotten, or they simply run out of battery. One alternative to providing accurate fall detection systems is making use of ambient microwave signals to detect movements. WiFi in particular is a technology that is present in many homes and interestingly, the signal transmission is affected when humans move in between the path of transmission. However, the setup needed for using this as an effective identification method is unclear. This paper focuses here on the performance gain in using multiple devices as transmitters and receivers, instead of only one pair in a simple identification task. We report an increased accuracy in identifying a human subject sitting and standing over a pool of machine learning algorithms when the two Raspberry PI pairs of devices were used in comparison to a single pair of devices.

AB  - Due to the health data privacy issues, wearable devices are less useful in the industry and can not reflect their potential power. Besides, wearable health devices bring constraints such as limited energy budget, needs to recharge and impact on daily activities. To recover these problems and fulfill healthcare needs, the recent trends in the literature is to use wireless signal to capture/recognize human activities. When human activity and emotion recognition study fields merging with the machine learning techniques, can offer a innovative systems. In recent years, with the help of wireless sensing mechanisms, this study field have gained more importance. So that, these wireless sensing mechanisms have eliminated the requirement of physical body contact such as sensor devices. Nowadays, wireless sensing technologies are preferred with the easy and cost-effective access to off-the-shelf WiFi-enabled devices. In this research, a human activity and emotion recognition system have proposed with usage of WiFi channel state information(CSI) mechanism that modelled by machine learning algorithms. As a result, with a tolerable error rate, it is possible to distinguish person’s heart rate information with a contactless solution via wi-fi signal.

AB  - Most people are unable to identify their actual illness, and many patients die before they are hospitalized. Therefore, in this research, a health monitoring system (HMS) is proposed and it suggests diseases such as arrhythmia, diabetes, fever, etc. and diagnoses chronic diseases in the ambulance itself and provides real-time prediction for critical and normal patients. The proposed system has a multi-tiered structure where physiological features are captured by wearable medical sensors (WMS) and machine learning suites are used to analyze data and to detect chronic diseases. Results obtained on the real datasets puts forward that sensor data and machine learning can effectively predict chronic diseases in real time. HMS can predict accuracies of various conditions such as arrhythmia (98.89%). Diabetes (96.74%), hypertension (98.85%), fever (99.85%) and thyroid (97.4%). In conclusion, we can say that the proposed HMS can assist us to monitor the affected person's physical condition at his/her residence, or at the ambulance within the golden hour of a patient's life.

AB  - There has been substantial expansion of the healthcare monitoring system in hospitals and other healthcare facilities, and many nations around the world are growing increasingly concerned about the availability of transportable health monitoring devices equipped with emerging technologies. In healthcare, the shift from in-person to remote consultations is made easier by the development of Internet of Things technology. This study offers an Internet of Things based healthcare system capable of real-time monitoring of vitals and environmental factors such as temperature and humidity in the patient’s current environment. Five different sensors, including a CO sensor, heart rate sensor body temperature probe, room temp sensor, and a CO2 sensor, are used to gather data from the hospital setting. The error rate of the developed method is always lower than a predetermined limit. A portal allows doctors to keep up with patient data and utilize it to make more informed decisions about treatment. The approach incorporates a cost for skipping over potentially harmful input in order to create a neural network convolution with more efficiency. This research modifies the convolution neural network’s architecture to account for the diversity of data features and the dynamism of data changes over time, with an eye toward eight physiological properties of data. The prediction accuracy of medical evaluation reaches 90.15%, which is higher than some other machine-learning algorithms thanks to the realized CNN optimization algorithm model’s increased prediction effect. The achievement of the system demonstrates that the built model is ideal for health monitoring.

AB  - Climate-related weather disasters not only cause billions of dollars in damages but also have long-lasting effects on human health. In Year 2022, approximately 600,000 pregnant women were affected by devastating floods in Pakistan. The majority of these pregnant women belonged to rural areas and had limited access to healthcare facilities. Fetal movement serves as a reliable indicator of a healthy fetus. The proposed approach involves using an accelerometer measurement of fetal movement, along with a mobile application that allows for easy usage outside clinical environments, enabling remote fetal movement monitoring. By preprocessing a pre-recorded dataset of the 3D accelerometer measurements, four state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms are implemented to classify fetal movement with a relative degree of accuracy. The Extreme Gradient Boost algorithm demonstrates superior performance in classifying fetal movement, achieving an accuracy of 94.58% and an average accuracy of 87.03% through k-fold cross-validation.

AB  - Stroke is one the most dangerous disease all across the world which would lead to serious disability or death among all aged people due to changes in environmental factors. Recent reports indicate that a mere 75 million people will suffer from stroke-related disabilities by the year 2030. It was also identified that a stroke occurs every 40 seconds on average across the globe. One out of every five stroke-related patients would die in a year. A Recent health survey indicates that most developed countries face a high number of stroke patients in very recent years. There is also a rapid growth in the number of stroke cases in developing countries. To prevent the high-risk factors related to stroke diseases, there is much need for continuous observation of physiological signals in real-time and to analyze the data. One of the main strategies is wearable technology that employs wireless sensor networks to link numerous medical devices and associated systems. They have to ability to function independently across several platforms. Wearable devices are used in most medical applications because of their noteworthy qualities, including adaptability, versatility, inexpensiveness, and efficiency in various platforms. Integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) with wearable devices and Fog Computing provides a more flexible mechanism to deploy a continuous healthcare monitoring system to monitor vital symptoms and to detect the early phase of stroke factors instantly. To predict stroke-related disorders, this research proposes a Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN)-centric healthcare system for continuous monitoring and examination of physiological signals. Initially, the proposed model predicts the nature of the symptoms based on the parameters collected by the IoT sensors. Deep learning techniques are then applied to predict the risk factors that are critical to the stroke patient during the emergency condition. The key contribution of this research work is to provide an emergency alert to a stroke patient and medical professionals for timely treatment to avoid critical conditions. Empirical analyses show that the proposed model delivers a good result with efficient bandwidth and less response time when compared to other existing healthcare models.

AB  - Patients with impaired mobility and neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, dementia etc. are vulnerable to bed falls, which can be damaging to their physical and psychological well-being. Existing systems are mostly fall detection based on wearable devices, which can be uncomfortable to wear or ambient devices such as cameras that invade privacy. A bed falls prediction system using force sensitive resistors (FSR) has been proposed in this paper. It is designed to eliminate privacy intrusion and discomfort issues. The system can identify the patient's different on-bed positions and determine the possibility of bed falls. In case of any risky position, the caretaker will be alerted to mobile applications via the Internet of Things (IoT), making patient monitoring more accessible and manageable. This integrated system yields an average of 92% accuracy for 5 different on-bed positions. The bed fall prediction system will facilitate caretakers/nurses to take care conveniently at homes, hospitals and assisted care facilities to ensure patients' health and safety.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) is making strong advances in healthcare with the promise of transformation in technological, social and economic prospects, paving the way for a healthy future. Medical devices equipped with wireless communication enable remote monitoring features and are increasingly becoming connected to each other and to the Internet. Such smart and connected medical devices referred to as the Internet of Medical Things have enabled continuous real-time patient monitoring, increase in diagnostic accuracy, and effective treatment. In spite of their numerous benefits, these devices open up newer attack surfaces thereby introducing multitude of security and privacy concerns. Attacks on Internet connected medical devices can potentially cause significant physical harm and life-threatening damage to the patients.

AB  - Modern Smart Health Systems (SHS) involve the concept of connected personal medical devices. These devices significantly improve the patient's lifestyle as they permit remote monitoring and transmission of health data (i.e., telemedicine), lowering the treatment costs for both the patient and the healthcare providers. Although specific SHS communication standards (i.e., ISO/IEEE 11073) enable real-time plug-and-play interoperability and communication between different personal medical devices, they do not specify any features for secure communications. In this paper, we demonstrate how personal medical device communication is indeed vulnerable to different cyber attacks. Specifically, we show how an external attacker can hook into the personal medical device's communication and eavesdrop the sensitive health data traffic, and implement manin-the-middle, replay, false data injection, and denial-of-service attacks. Furthermore, we also propose an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), HEKA, to monitor personal medical device traffic and detect attacks on them. HEKA passively hooks into the personal medical traffic generated by medical devices to learn the contiguous sequence of packets information from the captured traffic and detects irregular traffic-flow patterns using an n-grambased approach and different machine learning techniques. We implemented HEKA in a testbed consisting of eight off-the-shelf personal medical devices and evaluated its performance against four different attacks. Our extensive evaluation shows that HEKA can effectively detect different attacks on personal medical devices with an accuracy of 98.4% and Fl-score of 98%.

AB  - In this paper, we analyzed real-time physiological data using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict exercise exertion levels during exercise. The data was collected During a 16-minute cycling exercise for ten participants. Using wearable devices, Real-time ECG, pulse rate, oxygen saturation, pulse amplitude index (PAI), and revolutions per minute (RPM) data were collected at three intensity levels for each individual. Each subject’s ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) were gathered once per minute during each exercise session. Each 16-minute cycling window was divided into eight non-overlapping windows. For each 2-minute window, heart rate, RPM, PAI, and oxygen saturation levels were averaged to form the predictive features. In addition, the heart rate variability (HRV) features were extracted by analyzing the ECG data statistically and in both time and frequency domains. The extracted features formed most of the predictive features. We used the minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) algorithm response to the collected RPE to select the best features. The leading features were then used to train and test the LSTM regression to predict the next window’s exertion level.

AB  - Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) are a kind of Internet of Things (IoT) systems which are used in the healthcare domain. Nowadays, there are an abundance of wearable smart devices, either commercial or clinical, which can be used to collect vital signs and transmit the collected data to remote servers for further analysis. Remote patient monitoring, smart diagnostics, and autonomous control of chronic diseases are examples of different healthcare services that can be provided by these systems at a lower cost and higher efficiency compared to traditional healthcare settings. However, as data related to patients’ health status and treatment history, transmitted in these systems, are highly confidential and private, security and privacy concerns in their widespread adoption may arise. Deap Learning (DL) algorithms, with their ability in extracting knowledge from big data generated in these systems, can be leveraged to design smart security mechanisms. In this survey study, the recent literature on the DL-assisted security and privacy provisioning frameworks in IoMT systems are categorized and summarized with respect to their main contributions. Finally, some possible future directions are introduced to assist interested researchers to continue research in this domain.

AB  - Smart Health indicates the use of new technologies in the healthcare sector. Literally it means “intelligent health”, and the intelligence referred to is digital, guaranteed by innovative tools such as Internet of Things (IoT) devices, communication technologies, cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI) and big data. Thanks to sensors and devices connected to patients, such as technologically advanced bracelets and watches, it is possible to collect data on the state of health of people and treat them, even remotely, anticipating critical situations before they occur. The use of IoT to support healthcare leads to suitable recommendations and set the best policies for improving the quality of patients life, assisting practitioners and healthcare providers in decision making, collecting and exchanging information, helping to prevent events, such as a heart attack or an illness. This is possible thanks to the use of AI, which process immense amounts of data to anticipate future events. In recent years, AI based on deep learning has sparked tremendous global interest and is impacting also in healthcare. Deep learning has been widely adopted in image recognition, speech recognition and natural language processing. It could be the vehicle for translating big biomedical data into improved human health. The paper presents a literature review conducted to determine the most important technologies, methodologies, algorithms and models for smart health systems. In addition, the main application areas and challenges of smart health were explored.

AB  - The Coronavirus pandemic has elevated the importance of telehealth technology as an important component of modern and sustainable medicine. Telemedicine has practically eliminated the distance between patient and provider and it has also reduced the time and the cost associated with access to healthcare. Furthermore, pertinent to the COVID pandemic, increase use of telehealth will reduces risks of exposing providers and patients to the virus. Adoption rate limited to medical emergencies is insufficient. The World Health Organization (WHO) had issued advisement regarding the risks of infection especially in crowded hospitals and emergency rooms. Failures to adequately warn hospitals and health providers have resulted in q “multiplier effect” of exponential growth in infections, something which could have otherwise been avoided by safely treating patients ‘remotely’, from their homes. Our aim is to outline the concept of telehealth and a future structure of home care systems.

AB  - Modern wearable healthcare devices require new technologies with resource efficiency in terms of high performance, low energy consumption and diagnostic accuracy. In the field of artificial intelligence, the convolutional neural network (CNN) has performed as an effective algorithm. Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have been extensively utilised to construct hardware accelerators for CNNs. This paper suggests using an accelerator to create a specific 1-D CNN to classify the electrogram (ExG). ExGs used here include electrocardiogram, electroencephalogram and electromyography. The pipelined structure is designed with a register in the middle to facilitate easy data transfer. A 1-D CNN using an accelerator to categorise ExG signals implemented on Xilinx Zynq xc7z045 platform outperforms FPGA peer applications on the same platform by  $1.14\times $  in terms of speed. In addition, the 1-D CNN proposed accelerator operates very efficiently due to the use of a tristate buffer in the multiplexer and the substitution of the shift for the multiplier, resulting in a resource-efficient accelerator with 161 GOP/s/W energy efficiency and 28 GOP/s/KLUT, an improvement of 1.67 over the previous model. Finally, the performance of the accelerator applied to a Xilinx Zynq xc7z045 FPGA operating at 442.948MHz was calculated, achieving 1.145 TFLOP/s.

AB  - Freezing of Gait (FoG) is a common gait deficit among patients diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease (PD). In order to help these patients recover from FoG episodes, Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS) is needed. The authors propose a ubiquitous embedded system that detects FOG events with a Machine Learning (ML) subsystem from accelerometer signals. By making inferences on-device, we avoid issues prevalent in cloud-based systems such as latency and network connection dependency. The resource-efficient classifier used, reduces the model size requirements by approximately 400 times compared to the best performing standard ML systems, with a trade-off of a mere 1.3% in best classification accuracy. The aforementioned trade-off facilitates deployability in a wide range of embedded devices including microcontroller based systems. The research also explores the optimization procedure to deploy the model on an ATMega2560 microcontroller with a minimum system latency of 44.5 ms. The smallest model size of the proposed resource efficient ML model was 1.4 KB with an average recall score of 93.58%.

The proposed methodology introduces an Ear-EEG emotion recognition (EEER) system, leveraging a deep neural network and integrating the Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities. The key contributions of this study include 1) a comprehensive design framework encompassing both hardware and software aspects of the Ear-EEG system, as well as 2) a signals-to-three-channel image conversion method employing time-frequency super-resolution with superlets as inputs for deep learning models. Moreover, 3) a modified vision transformer (ViT) architecture is introduced, incorporating shifted patch tokenization (SPT) and locality self-attention (LSA) techniques, addressing challenges associated with limited and imbalanced small datasets, as well as the lack of locality inductive bias for emotion recognition. Additionally, 4) an IoT-assisted EEER platform is proposed, enabling remote monitoring and management. Experimental results indicate that the trained ViT model with SPT and LSA surpasses recent models in terms of performance on untrained datasets, achieving an average accuracy of 92.39%. The findings highlight the efficacy of the proposed EEER system in accurately detecting emotional states, encompassing positive and negative affective states. The integration of artificial intelligence and IoT-based healthcare platforms represents a significant advancement in the development of medical assistant tools with broad implications for future applications.

AB  - Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has become one of the most known and prominent research area in a variety of sectors during the last few decades. As a result, HAR can be used to keep tabs on a wide range of activities and the environment in general, all according to the user’s choices. HAR aims to categorize human actions in order to better understand how people behave. Its adaptability has recently piqued the curiosity of computer vision experts. RGB, skeleton, depth, infrared, point cloud, event stream, auditory, acceleration, radar, sensors, and Wi-Fi signals are just a few of the data techniques that can be used to describe human actions; each storing a slightly different collection of potentially relevant but separate information and each with their own set of benefits depending on the context of use. As a result, numerous previous articles attempted to investigate HAR methods through various means. The proposed method classifies the intelligence methods to HAR according to the various modalities from which input data can be collected and provide an in-depth examination of their relative merits and shortcomings. In this study, a comprehensive overview of current state of art in artificial intelligence is provided by including device modalities, data modalities, obstacles, and applications in HAR feature direction. The study provides some thoughts and proposals for future research based on the comparison of many HAR benchmark datasets.

The smart vest can track vital signs like heart rate and body temperature via two integrated sensors, IR temperature sensor and a heart-rate Sensor. Beyond vital signs, the vest also safeguards the soldier against environmental threats through an integrated gas sensor and an accelerometer sensor for the purpose of tracking the movement of the soldier. The accelerometer sensor is integrated into the smart military vest by offering motion detection for fall detection. This strengthens military personnel's safety and effectiveness during operations. By encompassing these both technologies, physiological and environmental monitoring, the smart vest also unlocks a new frontier in silent, covert communication through a gesture-based communication system. This novel technology enables soldiers to exchange crucial information via hand gestures, revolutionizing battlefield communication in noise-filled or radio-restricted environments and helping soldiers to exchange information with each other in critical situations.

AB  - Coronary artery disease (CAD), an acute and life-threatening cardiovascular disease, is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Coronary angiography, the principal diagnostic tool for CAD, is invasive, expensive, and requires a lot of skilled effort. The current study aims to develop an automated and non-invasive CAD detection model and improve its performance as closely as possible to clinically acceptable diagnostic sensitivity. Electrocardiogram (ECG) characteristics are observed to be altered due to CAD and can be studied to develop a screening tool for its detection. The subject’s clinical information can help broadly identify the high-cardiac-risk population and serve as a primary step in diagnosing CAD. This paper presents an approach to automatically detect CAD based on clinical data, morphological ECG features, and heart rate variability (HRV) features extracted from short-duration Lead-II ECG recordings. A few popular machine-learning classifiers, including support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), K-nearest neighbours (KNN), Gaussian Naïve Bayes (GNB), and multi-layer perceptron (MLP), are trained on the extracted feature space, and their performance is evaluated. Classifiers built by integrating clinical data and features extracted from ECG recordings demonstrated better performance than those built on each feature set separately, and the RF classifier outperforms other considered machine learners and reports an average testing accuracy of 94% and a G-mean score of 92% with a 5-fold cross-validation training accuracy of 95(± 0.04)%.Clinical relevance— The proposed method uses a brief, single-lead ECG recording and performs similarly to current clinical practices in an explainable manner. This makes it suitable for deployment via wearable technology (like smart watch gadgets) and telemonitoring, which may facilitate an earlier and more widespread CAD diagnosis.

AB  - The prevalence of cardiovascular diseases as a source of sickness and mortality around the world calls for early detection and efficient management for better patient outcomes and lower health care costs. The limits of traditional diagnostic techniques, such as electrocardiography (ECG), are brought on by the need for specialized equipment and qualified medical professionals. To enable remote cardiac illness diagnosis and management, this study introduces a new smart health monitoring system that makes use of ECG sensors, the Internet of Things (IoT), and machine learning. The system uses wireless sensors to continually gather real-time ECG data from patients. It then sends this data to a cloud server via an IoT gateway where it is analyzed by a machine learning model that has been trained on different heart conditions. Following the development of customized treatment plans based on the specific needs of each patient, healthcare practitioners are instantly alerted to any potential issues discovered through forecasts. The system's accuracy and dependability are rigorously evaluated using real data, and ethical and legal issues are painstakingly taken into account to safeguard patient autonomy and privacy. With the potential to improve patient outcomes, lower healthcare costs, enable remote patient monitoring, and support individualized care, this suggested system has the power to change the diagnosis and treatment of cardiac disease.

AB  - This paper presents a deep learning model 'PP-Net' which is the first of its kind, having the capability to estimate the physiological parameters: Diastolic blood pressure (DBP), Systolic blood pressure (SBP), and Heart rate (HR) simultaneously from the same network using a single channel PPG signal. The proposed model is designed by exploiting the deep learning framework of Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Network (LRCN), exhibiting inherent ability of feature extraction, thereby, eliminating the cost effective steps of feature selection and extraction, making less-complex for deployment on resource constrained platforms such as mobile platforms. The performance demonstration of the PP-Net is done on a larger and publically available MIMIC-II database. We achieved an average NMAE of 0.09 (DBP) and 0.04 (SBP) mmHg for BP, and 0.046 bpm for HR estimation on total population of 1557 critically ill subjects. The accurate estimation of HR and BP on a larger population compared to the existing methods, demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed deep learning framework. The accurate evaluation on a huge population with CVD complications, validates the robustness of the proposed framework in pervasive healthcare monitoring especially cardiac and stroke rehabilitation monitoring.

AB  - Recently, the techniques of Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile communications have been developed to gather human and environment information data for a variety of intelligent services and applications. Remote monitoring of elderly and disabled people living in smart homes is highly challenging due to probable accidents which might occur due to daily activities such as falls. For elderly people, fall is considered as a major reason for death of post-traumatic complication. So, early identification of elderly people falls in smart homes is needed to increase the survival rate of the person or offer required support. Recently, the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), IoT, wearables, smartphones, etc. makes it feasible to design fall detection systems for smart homecare. In this view, this paper presents an IoT enabled elderly fall detection model using optimal deep convolutional neural network (IMEFD-ODCNN) for smart homecare. The goal of the IMEFD-ODCNN model is to enable smartphones and intelligent deep learning (DL) algorithms to detect the occurrence of falls in the smart home. Primarily, the input video captured by the IoT devices is pre-processed in different ways like resizing, augmentation, and min-max based normalization. Besides, SqueezeNet model is employed as a feature extraction technique to derive appropriate feature vectors for fall detection. In addition, the hyperparameter tuning of the SqueezeNet model takes place using the salp swarm optimization (SSO) algorithm. Finally, sparrow search optimization algorithm (SSOA) with variational autoencoder (VAE), called SSOA-VAE based classifier is employed for the classification of fall and non-fall events. Finally, in case of fall event detected, the smartphone sends an alert to the caretakers and hospital management. The performance validation of the IMEFD-ODCNN model takes place on UR fall detection dataset and multiple cameras fall dataset. The experimental outcomes highlighted the promising performance of the IMEFD-ODCNN model over the recent methods with the maximum accuracy of 99.76% and 99.57% on the multiple cameras fall and UR fall detection dataset.

AB  - The spread of COVID-19, which has infected over 10 million people worldwide, entails the need for fast and aggressive testing never like before. As countries look to expanding testing, such test solutions must not only be technically sound, but should also be feasible and convenient for the user. The aim of this paper is to review the emerging tests and technology which can be potentially used to detect and assess the condition of those infected with the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the challenges in their development and use. The paper deals with 1) In vitro diagnostic tests(IVDs),i.e tests that use biological samples like blood and consist of 2 types: nucleic acid tests, which detect the RNA of the virus, and antibody tests which antibodies created by the body in response to the virus. 2) Chest X-Ray and CT scan devices, associated Deep Learning based detection methods and portable devices. 3) Wearable sensors, IoT and telemedicine for remote monitoring of COVID-19 patients to assess their condition, and also of Non-COVID-19 ones to reduce risks of cross-infection.

AB  - Complex sensor arrays prohibit practical deployment of existing wearables-based algorithms for free-living analysis of muscle and joint mechanics. Machine learning techniques have been proposed as a potential solution, however, they are less interpretable and generalizable when compared to physics-based techniques. Herein, we propose a hybrid method utilizing inertial sensor- and electromyography (EMG)-driven simulation of muscle contraction to characterize knee joint and muscle mechanics during walking gait. Machine learning is used only to map a subset of measured muscle excitations to a full set thereby reducing the number of required sensors. We demonstrate the utility of the approach for estimating net knee flexion moment (KFM) as well as individual muscle moment and work during the stance phase of gait across nine unimpaired subjects. Across all subjects, KFM was estimated with 0.91%BW•H RMSE and strong correlations (r = 0.87) compared to ground truth inverse dynamics analysis. Estimates of individual muscle moments were strongly correlated (r = 0.81–0.99) with a reference EMG-driven technique using optical motion capture and a full set of electrodes as were estimates of muscle work (r = 0.88–0.99). Implementation of the proposed technique in the current work included instrumenting only three muscles with surface electrodes (lateral and medial gastrocnemius and vastus medialis) and both the thigh and shank segments with inertial sensors. These sensor locations permit instrumentation of a knee brace/sleeve facilitating a practically deployable mechanism for monitoring muscle and joint mechanics with performance comparable to the current state-of-the-art.
