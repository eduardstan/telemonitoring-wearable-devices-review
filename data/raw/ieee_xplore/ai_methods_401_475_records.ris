AB  - Owing to increasing connected medical devices and rapid development of deep learning technologies, the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has attracted great attention for healthcare monitoring with intelligent sensors. Radar serves as a non-contact healthcare device, continuously measuring human’s vital signs and behavior to provide daily and comprehensive long-term record on health status. However, radar sensor data collected from various users and families usually involve sensitive personal information, while traditional deep learning technologies using IoMT radar data may present high privacy leakage risks. This paper proposes FedRadar, a novel federated multi-task transfer learning framework for radar-based heartbeat rate and activity monitoring in IoMT to solve these challenges. It deals with the decentralized structure, training personalized multi-task models collaboratively, combining the shared relevance knowledge of human’s physiological information while keeping personal radar data locally for privacy protection. First, the multi-task neural network is built on the spatial-temporal radar data to capture the potential relationship and shared representations between human’s vital sign and activity. Furthermore, the federated learning with knowledge transfer scheme is designed to achieve personalized local models by transferring coarse relevant features and keeping fine-grained individual information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of FedRadar with 2.8% and 2.5% superior than local training model respectively on the accuracy of heartbeat rate estimation and activity classification in realistic constructed radar datasets. In addition, FedRadar is extensible and suitable to continuously monitor multiple health indicators with privacy protection in IoMT. The FedRadar codes and constructed radar datasets are available on https://github.com/bupt-uwb/FedRadar.

AB  - In social IoMT systems, resource-constrained devices face the challenges of limited computation, bandwidth, and privacy in the deployment of deep learning models. Federated learning (FL) is one of the solutions to user privacy and provides distributed training among several local devices. In addition, it reduces the computation and bandwidth of transferring videos to the central server in camera-based IoMT devices. In this work, we design an edge-based federated framework for such devices. In contrast to traditional methods that drop the resource-constrained stragglers in a federated round, our system provides a methodology to incorporate them. We propose a new phase in the FL algorithm, known as split learning. The stragglers train collaboratively with the nearest edge node using split learning. We test the implementation using heterogeneous computing devices that extract vital signs from videos. The results show a reduction of 3.6 h in the training time of videos using the split learning phase with respect to the traditional approach. We also evaluate the performance of the devices and system with key parameters, CPU utilization, memory consumption, and data rate. Furthermore, we achieve 87.29% and 60.26% test accuracy at the nonstragglers and stragglers, respectively, with a global accuracy of 90.32% at the server. Therefore, FedCare provides a straggler-resistant federated method for a heterogeneous system for social IoMT devices.

AB  - Flexible tactile sensors have become one of the most attractive research areas because of its great application prospect in electronic skin, healthcare monitoring and artificial intelligence. However, there are still great challenges in mimicking the human skin’s strong ability of tactile perception to the changes of external physical information. Nowadays, in addition to flexible polymers and conductive materials, the microstructure of sensing units is a key factor to improve the performance of tactile sensors such as sensitivity, fast response and robustness. In recent years, a variety of novel microstructure designs have been applied to applications of tactile information perception and numerous corresponding processing methods have also been developed, which provides a wealth of enlightening solutions for the production of electronic skins. Herein, a large number of research results of tactile sensor devices are systematically reviewed according to different three-dimensional geometric shapes of the microstructures which are grouped into several categories. At the same time, relevant processing technologies employed, working principles and chief performance characteristics are also briefly described. Relative merits of different types of microstructure applications are clearly elaborated through the classification and comparison of multiple microstructure geometries in this paper to provide valuable reference for sensing microstructure design and fabrication of tactile sensors in corresponding engineering applications. Moreover, current difficulties and challenges in fabrication of flexible microstructures and future investigative directions pertaining to this field have been discussed.

AB  - Objective: Sleep monitoring has extensively utilized electroencephalogram (EEG) data collected from the scalp, yielding very large data repositories and well-trained analysis models. Yet, this wealth of data is lacking for emerging, less intrusive modalities, such as ear-EEG.Methods and procedures: The current study seeks to harness the abundance of open-source scalp EEG datasets by applying models pre-trained on data, either directly or with minimal fine-tuning; this is achieved in the context of effective sleep analysis from ear-EEG data that was recorded using a single in-ear electrode, referenced to the ipsilateral mastoid, and developed in-house as described in our previous work. Unlike previous studies, our research uniquely focuses on an older cohort (17 subjects aged 65-83, mean age 71.8 years, some with health conditions), and employs LightGBM for transfer learning, diverging from previous deep learning approaches. Results: Results show that the initial accuracy of the pre-trained model on ear-EEG was 70.1%, but fine-tuning the model with ear-EEG data improved its classification accuracy to 73.7%. The fine-tuned model exhibited a statistically significant improvement (p < 0.05, dependent t-test) for 10 out of the 13 participants, as reflected by an enhanced average Cohen’s kappa score (a statistical measure of inter-rater agreement for categorical items) of 0.639, indicating a stronger agreement between automated and expert classifications of sleep stages. Comparative SHAP value analysis revealed a shift in feature importance for the N3 sleep stage, underscoring the effectiveness of the fine-tuning process.Conclusion: Our findings underscore the potential of fine-tuning pre-trained scalp EEG models on ear-EEG data to enhance classification accuracy, particularly within an older population and using feature-based methods for transfer learning. This approach presents a promising avenue for ear-EEG analysis in sleep studies, offering new insights into the applicability of transfer learning across different populations and computational techniques.Clinical impact: An enhanced ear-EEG method could be pivotal in remote monitoring settings, allowing for continuous, non-invasive sleep quality assessment in elderly patients with conditions like dementia or sleep apnea.

AB  - The Emergency Medical Services (EMS) program in Oman is just getting its feet off the ground at the moment. The EMS system, which is commonly utile-utilized countries that are a part of the Anglo-American region, was utilized in the process of producing it. Currently, the Royal Oman Police (ROP) Ambulance Division is responsible for the operation of this facility. It is run by Advanced Emergency Medical Technicians who have credentials from Oman (AEMT). In this study, the data from the EMS system were subjected to an IOMT analysis. The system, which was created to handle medical and trauma crises concurrently, covers the majority of the nation. Plans call for adding air medical services in addition to the current ground ambulance service as part of the country-wide expansion of the current ground ambulance service. The results of this study demonstrate that technology can assist in the remote monitoring of a variety of cardiovascular illnesses (CVDs), including diabetes, hypertension, and congestive heart failure (CHF), as well as the discomfort and stress brought on by these ailments. E-textile sensors that were sewed into garments were used to assist in electrocardiogram analysis (ECG). An electrocardiogram is a piece of paper that depicts the electrical activity of the heart (ECG). Both the depolarization that takes place during the atrial and ventricular cardiac muscles' contraction and the repolarization that takes place during their relaxation can be captured by an ECG. E-textile sensors that can be sewed into clothing are now the most innovative technology available to the healthcare industry. There are many different kinds of wearable E-textiles on the market right now. Among other things, these E-textiles may regulate temperature, emit light, and react to touch. Wet Ag/AgCI1 electrodes or electrodes coated with silver and graphene ink were used in this investigation on a total of 100 patients as comparison electrodes. It is advised to use a band-pass filter and a notch filter to do additional processing on the collected ECG data. It has been advised to do this. At this time, the identities of the MSE, SNR, and PRD are all known. In the end, the Fisher approach for feature selection was used to choose eight characteristics for the model. The CVD scenarios were divided into categories and categorized using the KNN classification method.

AB  - The revolution of IoT highly impacts on different applications such as remote sensing, smart cities, and remote digital healthcare. People use IoT devices for performing business transactions, daily tasks, and healthcare monitoring. IoT devices generate huge amounts of data assets that have potential applications. Biometrics is a potential application of sensors data. The traditional biometric methods such as PINs, passwords are exposed to numerous attacks such as replication, repeated passwords, etc. Sensors’ data-based continuous authentication methods are suitable for maintaining users’ privacy and security in mobile IoT systems. Most of the existing authentication methods have applied motion-based sensors for building users’ identification profiles. The proposed method uses motion sensors and biomedical sensors for reliable and multi-factor user authentication. In this article, we have introduced an IoT sensors data analytics framework to construct user authentication models. We apply the fiducial points-based feature extraction method data for extracting discriminative features. These features act as unique user profiles for authentication purposes. We have performed a detailed analysis of the proposed approach using the publically available datasets. The experiments elaborate on the effectiveness of IoTauth for improved authentication results.

AB  - The widespread adoption of wearable devices and social media is generating population-scale data about people's behavior as situated in their everyday lives. In this paper, an embedded Cyber-Human System (CHS) is used to monitor a person's mental health via physiological, behavioral, and social data. These three data streams will then be relayed to an application used by a professional within the medical industry, to allow remote monitoring of the user's mental health without the uncertainty that face-to-face interviews can introduce. Experimentation and verification have been conducted on a group of test subjects with different test scenarios including a happy, sad, angry, and neutral state of being. We propose to use physiological data to predict a person's emotional state using a machine learning classification algorithm. The proposed system can distinguish between the different emotional states with an accuracy of 92.9%.

AB  - Merging electrophysiology signal monitoring technology with wearable devices offers interesting future health care options. This study presented carbon-based screen-printing inks produced by mixing a graphite composite with a polymer emulsion to bind with flexible fabric substrates and tested with 10,000 bending cycles. The prepared carbon-based ink performed well for electrical conduction and vital signal response. Adding calcium carbonate resulted in a microstructure of graphite that decreased the electrical sheet resistance and resistance to 11.61 Ω/◻ and 0.127 Ω. The signal-to-noise ratio of the electrocardiogram (ECG) was 31.02 dB with built-in front-end powering noise filtration. Noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP) was achieved by bio-impedance measurement and showed outstanding systolic and diastolic pressure values with a correlation coefficient of 0.799, and exhibited a similar interval time to define the same precise heart rate. The ECG data from the prepared electrode were applied to the machine learning models. The Random Forest (RF) model exhibited the optimized prediction value, with an F1 score of 99.9%. Equipment made from carbon screen-printing inks showed potential for health care monitoring with no excessive pressure, dry processing, and repeatability as a flexible wearable bio-electronic device.

AB  - The management and care of premature infants in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) demand precise and frequent monitoring of various health parameters, including body weight. Traditional methods of weighing premature infants often involve the removal and reinsertion of medical tubes, a process that can cause discomfort and potential health risks to these vulnerable patients. This abstract introduces an innovative weight monitoring system designed to provide real-time, accurate measurements of a premature infant’s weight in milligrams without the need to disturb the infant or remove medical tubing. Utilizing the NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontroller and a sensitive load cell, the system offers a non-intrusive, continuous weight monitoring solution. The design addresses the critical need for minimizing physical handling of premature infants while ensuring accurate weight tracking, a key indicator of health and development. The system’s capability to transmit real-time data to medical professionals’ aid in timely decision-making and enhances the overall care process. The design and implementation of the system, including the integration of the NodeMCU ESP8266 platform with the load cell for high-precision measurements, are detailed. Furthermore, the calibration process, data accuracy, and the system’s potential to reduce the workload of medical staff and improve the standard of care in NICUs are discussed. Preliminary results and implications for future research and clinical application are also presented, highlighting the system’s role in advancing neonatal care technology.

AB  - The last decade has seen tremendous improvements in technologies for Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) management, in particular the so-called artificial pancreas (AP), a wearable closed-loop device modulating insulin injection based on glucose sensor readings. Unluckily, the AP actuator, an insulin pump, is subject to failures, with potentially serious consequences for subject safety. This calls for the development of advanced monitoring systems, leveraging the unprecedented data availability. This paper tackles for the first time the problem of automatically detecting pump faults with multidimensional data-driven anomaly detection (AD) methodologies. The approach allows to avoid the subtask of identifying a physiological model, typical of model-based approaches. Furthermore, we employ unsupervised methods, removing the need of labeled data for training, hardly available in practice. The adopted data-driven AD methods are local outlier factor, connectivity-based outlier factor, and isolation forest. Moreover, we propose a modification of these methods to cope with the dynamic nature of the underlying problem. The algorithms were tuned and tested on: 1) two-synthetic 100-patients' data set, of one-month data each, generated using the “UVA/Padova T1D Simulator,” a large-scale nonlinear computer simulator of T1D subject physiology, largely adopted in AP research and accepted by the American Food and Drug Administration as a replacement of preclinical animal trials for AP and 2) a real 7-patients' data set consisting of one month in free-living conditions. The satisfactory accuracy of the proposed approach paves the way to the embedding of these methodologies in AP systems or their deployment in remote monitoring systems.

AB  - Internet of things (IoT) and machine learning based systems incorporating smart wearable technology are rapidly evolving to monitor and manage healthcare and physical activities. This paper is focused on the proposition of a fog-centric wireless, real-time, smart wearable and IoT-based framework for ubiquitous health and fitness analysis in a smart gym environment. The proposed framework aims to aid in the health and fitness industry based on body vitals, body movement and health related data. The framework is expected to assist athletes, trainers and physicians with the interpretation of multiple physical signs and raise alerts in case of any health hazard. We proposed a method to collect and analyze exercise specific data which can be used to measure exercise intensity and its benefit to athlete's health and serve as recommendation system for upcoming athletes. We determined the validity of the proposed framework by giving a six weeks workout plan with six days a week for workout activity targeting all muscles followed by one day for recovery. We recorded the electrocardiogram, heart rate, heart rate variability, breath rate, and determined athlete's movement using a 3D-acceleration. The collected data in the research is used in two modules. A Health zone module implemented on body vitals data which categorizes athlete's health state into various categories. Hzone module is responsible for health hazards identification and alarming. Outstandingly, the Hzone module is able to identify an athlete's physical state with 97% accuracy. A gym activity recognition (GAR) module is implemented to recognize workout activity in real-time using body movements and body vitals data. The purpose of the GAR module is to collect and analyze exercise specific data. The GAR module achieved an accuracy of above 89% on athlete independent model based on muscle group.

AB  - The need to improve smart health systems to monitor the health situation of patients has grown as a result of the spread of epidemic diseases, the ageing of the population, the increase in the number of patients, and the lack of facilities to treat them. This led to an increased demand for remote healthcare systems using biosensors. These biosensors produce a large volume of sensed data that will be received by the edge of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) to be forwarded to the data centers of the cloud for further treatment. An edge-fog computing-enabled lossless electroencephalogram (EEG) data compression with epileptic seizure detection in IoMT networks is proposed in this article. The proposed approach achieves three functionalities. First, it reduces the amount of sent data from the edge to the fog gateway using lossless EEG data compression based on a hybrid approach of  $k$ -means clustering and Huffman encoding (KCHE) at the edge gateway. Second, it decides the epileptic seizure situation of the patient at the fog gateway based on the epileptic seizure detector-based Naive Bayes (ESDNB) algorithm. Third, it reduces the size of IoMT EEG data delivered to the cloud using the same lossless compression algorithm in the first step. Various measures implemented to show the effectiveness of the suggested approach and the comparison results confirm that the KCHE reduces the amount of EEG data transmitted to the fog and cloud platform and produces a suitable detection of an epileptic seizure. The average of compression power of the proposed KCHE is four times the average of compression power of other methods for all EEG records ( $Z, F, N, O$ , and  $S$ ). Furthermore, the proposed ESDNB outperforms the other methods in terms of accuracy, where it provides accuracy from 99.53 % up to 99.99 % using the data set of Bonn University.

AB  - The study of human regular tasks have become more prevalent and accessible as a result of the widespread use of different sensors integrated into mobile devices. This issue now exists in different vast real-world area applications some examples are “healthcare monitoring, fitness tracking, and user-adaptive systems”. Where a generic model capable of recognizing an arbitrary user’s activity in real-time is necessary. This paper presents a user-independent deep learning technique for digital human activity categorization. The proposed research study advocates the utilization of CNN in combination with basic statistical characteristics to maintain the information regarding the global shape of different time series for performing a local feature extraction.

AB  - In order to solve the contradiction between the large number of ventilators, large amount of data and limited medical personnel, this paper proposes a solution based on Golang and MongoDB. In this scheme, the ventilator uploads the device data information in real time through UDP. Based on Golang concurrency and EPOLL-ET mode, the server realizes high performance and scalability. MongoDB is used to store structured data. Compared with traditional solutions, this scheme has a more convenient way of development and stronger horizontal expansion ability, which can expand to more medical device. The test results show that the single Web service supports the maximum QPS of 105485 for short connections and 334687 for long connections. The single device service can support 3000 online devices and consumes fewer system resources.

AB  - Recent trends have shown a widespread increase in the landscape of digital healthcare (i.e., Healthcare 4.0) services, such as personalized healthcare, intelligent rehabilitation, telemedicine, and smart diet management, among others. These healthcare services are based on a variety of diverse requirements. Fulfilling these requirements require proactive intelligent analytics and self-sustainability of networks. Self-sustainability enables the operation of a network with minimum possible interaction from the end-users/network operators, whereas proactive intelligent analytics enables efficient management of resources in response to users’ requests. To enable healthcare 4.0 with proactive online analytics and self-sustainability, one can leverage digital twins. In this article, we present an overview and recent advances of digital twins for healthcare 4.0. An architecture of digital twins for healthcare is also proposed. Furthermore, we present several use cases of digital twins. Finally, we present open research challenges with possible solutions.

AB  - The effective utilization of real-world data is an integral part of any IoT monitoring or AI-assisted system. Thus, data collection and annotation is an important step towards the successful development and realization of such systems. Nevertheless, in order to create reliable datasets, current data collection and annotation methodologies often require a controlled environment while also the presence of the volunteer contributing to the process, or any subject for that matter, and an expert, monitoring the procedure, is mandatory. These processes are heavily restrained by the recent COVID-19 pandemic outbreak.To address such issues, in this paper we propose a human-centered Web-based dataset creation and annotation tool that utilizes the Web Bluetooth API. The user can effectively collect gestures from a nearby device that supports the BLE protocol, assign tags to the collected data, and store them remotely, in real-time. The data storage, as well as its annotation, can also be performed remotely by an expert stakeholder. An off-the-shelf wearable sensorial device has been used indicatively for our tool demonstration purposes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt that exploits the Web Bluetooth API capabilities for the development of a Browser-based real-time data collection, storage, and annotation tool. Our tool can be also expanded to other applications that use the sensing device with only minor configuration changes and is also operable through any smart-device that supports a Web-Browser. Furthermore, our tool’s performance matches that of native applications’. Finally, the tool is successfully deployed and validated by integrating it into our ongoing ML platform that is related to allergic rhinitis gesture recognition.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence technology has made a huge leap forward. However, the current systems still fall short when faced with the catastrophic challenge of forgetting. Deep neural networks face huge limitations, including the tendency to forget learned tasks as they perform new tasks. While neuroscience research suggests that the human brain synapses can overcome this challenge through the ability to adapt based on historical information, applying similar mechanisms to deep neural networks to prevent forgetting previous data proves to be a monumental task.In this study, our focus lies on using these improved deep networks to provide assistance to people afflicted with Alzheimer’s disease, a prevalent condition among the elderly. Due to cognitive impairments, individuals with Alzheimer’s often require ongoing support to carry out daily activities necessary for their well-being. To tackle the issue of forgetfulness in deep neural networks, specifically binary neural networks, and grant them the ability of multitasking and continuous learning, we propose an effective training method. This can be achieved by treating the hidden weights as semi-modifiable variables and adapting the training methodology accordingly. The proposed remote monitoring system consists of two main components. The first component is the Human Activity and Patient Behavior Monitoring (HAR) Identification Unit, which focuses on monitoring and identifying patterns in the activities and behaviors of Alzheimer’s patients. The second component is a support unit that detects anomalies and behavioral problems and provides appropriate warnings. This system is based on augmentative learning technology. As a result of our research, we have developed auxiliary systems specifically designed for Alzheimer’s patients. Activity details are as follows. We achieved excellent results for Activity 1 (Task 1) with an accuracy of 99.51% and Activity 2 (Task 2) was also well-addressed by our system, reaching an accuracy of 96.63%. Finally, we conducted a comparative study, comparing our system’s performance complexity with previous systems using the Dem@care Dataset.

AB  - Postural instability is associated with disease status and fall risk in Persons with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS). However, assessments of postural instability, known as postural sway, leverage force platforms or wearable accelerometers, and are most often conducted in laboratory environments and are thus not broadly accessible. Remote measures of postural sway captured during daily life may provide a more accessible alterative, but their ability to capture disease status and fall risk has not yet been established. We explored the utility of remote measures of postural sway in a sample of 33 PwMS. Remote measures of sway differed significantly from lab-based measures, but still demonstrated moderately strong associations with patient-reported measures of balance and mobility impairment. Machine learning models for predicting fall risk trained on lab data provided an Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.79, while remote data only achieved an AUC of 0.51. Remote model performance improved to an AUC of 0.74 after a new, subject-specific k-means clustering approach was applied for identifying the remote data most appropriate for modelling. This cluster-based approach for analyzing remote data also strengthened associations with patient-reported measures, increasing their strength above those observed in the lab. This work introduces a new framework for analyzing data from remote patient monitoring technologies and demonstrates the promise of remote postural sway assessment for assessing fall risk and characterizing balance impairment in PwMS.

AB  - Diabetes Mellitus is a disease characterized by inadequate control of blood glucose levels, and it ranks among the leading causes of human mortality, the measurement of which, requires fingertip pricking. Nowadays, non-invasive healthcare monitoring systems based on wearable sensors and machine learning models hold the future of smart health. However, the nature of these methods is such that they get affected by internal physiological and external parameters, which is one of the obstacles to this path. This study aims to introduce a non-invasive blood glucose level classification method based on machine learning analysis. The device's sensor consists of an optical finger sensor that transmits near-infrared light, filtering, and amplification to reduce the noise of the extracted photoplethysmography signal. Moreover, we have adopted the four-stage framework of biomedical signal processing to analyze the acquired PPG signal. Before using the Savitzky-Golay derivation to pre-filter the signal and prepare it for feature extraction, it was normalized using Standard Normal Variate (SNV). In addition, four different machine learning models, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Weighted K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Wide Neural Network, and Decision Tree were used for blood glucose level classification. For this study, a dataset was created consisting of 106 data, gathered from 27 subjects. Findings revealed that the Weighted KNN exhibited the best performance among other classification models, having 90.5% accuracy.

Frequent, unobtrusive assessment of naturalistic motor performance could enable clinicians to better assess rehabilitation effectiveness and monitor patients' recovery trajectories. We therefore propose and validate a two-phase data analytic pipeline to estimate upper-limb impairment based on the naturalistic performance of activities of daily living (ADLs). Eighteen stroke survivors were equipped with an inertial sensor on the stroke-affected wrist and performed up to four ADLs in a naturalistic manner. Continuous inertial time series were segmented into sliding windows, and a machine-learned model identified windows containing instances of point-to-point (P2P) movements. Using kinematic features extracted from the detected windows, a subsequent model was used to estimate upper-limb motor impairment, as measured by the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA). Both models were evaluated using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. The P2P movement detection model had an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.72. FMA estimates had a normalized root mean square error of 18.8% with $R^{2}=0.72$. These promising results support the potential to develop seamless, ecologically valid measures of real-world motor performance.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) technology has been widely adopted across various industries for remote decision-making, monitoring, and surveillance. The proliferation of IoT applications in sensitive sectors, such as national defense and security, has been driven by the ability to obtain in-depth information on ubiquitous occurrences. Conspicuously, the current research presents a comprehensive framework based on the IoT-empowered Digital Twin technology for assessing the national integrity of defense personnel. The primary objective is to identify the integral behavior of military personnel by securely tracking everyday activities. The proposed method demonstrated the ability to accurately analyze an individual’s anomalous occurrences in activities using a hybrid Convolution Neural Network with Gated Recurrent Units. Moreover, each personnel is mapped using a secure blockchain platform for acquiring social interactions and activities to identify potential threats to national security. The proposed model has been validated using challenging date sets obtained from public repositories. The computed results indicate that the proposed solution is successful in facilitating the development of high-quality defense services. The effectiveness of the suggested solution is evaluated using statistical metrics including vulnerable activity recognition (Precision 95.24%), model training and testing (Precision 95.24%, Recall (95.00%), and F-Measure 94.11%), latency rate (7.45 seconds), and data processing cost( $\theta $ ((n-1) logn)).

AB  - Developing the capability to continuously and noninvasively monitor the mental health status of individuals is a critical focus in the mHealth domain. The use of passively-generated data gathered via smart and portable electronic devices to monitor specific indicators of mental health has shown potential to serve as an effective alternative to traditional intrusive survey-based approaches to monitoring mental health remotely. In this study, we propose a remote health monitoring framework for dynamic, flexible, and scalable assessment and detection of physiological precursors of a stress response. Our method comprises a smartwatch-based system for continuous monitoring of primary physiological signals, followed by a deep neural network architecture that performs the fusion and processing of the multi-modal sensor readings. We empirically validate our system on a cohort of university-affiliated members of the military. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of our passive-sensing system for tracking perceived stress, the results of which can be used to obtain a better understanding of patient behavior and improve personalized treatments1.

AB  - Falling is one of the primary causes of firefighter casualties. Therefore, early fall detection, followed by reliable and timely notification, is vital to ensure the survival of firefighters. However, due to complex and diverse firefighting scenarios, current fall detection systems (FDSs) are inadequate, especially in terms of accuracy and real-time applications. Hence, in this study, a wearable pre-impact FDS (PIFDS) for firefighters is proposed. We also evaluated the feasibility of using machine learning (ML) and ensemble learning (EL) methods deployed on the edge node to simultaneously improve the real-time performance and accuracy. Moving thresholding method is introduced to overcome the class-imbalanced issue due to fewer samples acquired during the pre-impact (PI) phase. Based on 14 firefighters’ data collection, the experimental results revealed that a Decision Tree classifier with optimized parameters (DT-ED4) outperformed other ML and EL methods in a tradeoff between processing time and accuracy. The results also showed that our system can detect falls before the impact with an average lead time of 447.9 ms, sensitivity of 95.10%, and specificity of 97.99%. The system’s heterogeneous IoT network architecture facilitated remote monitoring and alerts that enabled the incident commander (IC) to execute the rescue mission immediately upon notification. This study enhances the practicability of PIFDS and extends the application range of PIFDS from healthcare to firefighting.

In this paper, our goal is to identify the most accurate Deep Learning (DL) algorithm under tiny deployability constraints. Our results show that a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) given by the combination of a one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (ID-CNN) with Bi-directional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU) is the most attractive solution, with respect to Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and the recently introduced Legendre Memory Unit (LMU). The algorithm performance is investigated over a publicly available dataset consisting of 19 different daily activities. According to the obtained results, 1D-CNN-BiGRU has an average accuracy within 0.2% of that of BiGRU (the RNN with highest accuracy) with an execution time more than 4 times shorter.

AB  - The ongoing pandemic of Corona-Virus (COVID-19) induced by the coming forth category of SARS-CoV-2, has terrified the worldwide human health. Primarily, COVID-19 challenges can be categorized into (a) way of epidemic prevention and blocking transmission, (b) live monitoring of infected / suspected persons (c) FDA approved vaccine. Leading to said COVID-19 (a), (b) challenges, digit technologies such Artificial Intelligence, Big data analytics and Internet of Things (IoT), can play a vital role in epidemic prevention and blocking COVID-19 transmission. In this study, we have proposed a smart edge surveillance system that is effective in remote monitoring, advance warning and detection of a person's fever, heart beat rate, cardiac conditions and some of the radiological features to detect the infected (suspicious) person using wearable smart gadgets. The proposed framework provides a continually updated map/pattern of communication chain of COVID-19 infected persons that may span around in our national community. The health and societal impact of suggested research is to help public health authorities, researchers and clinicians contain and manage this disease through smart edge surveillance systems. The proposed model will help to detect and track the contagious person. Moreover, it will also keep the patient's data record for analysis and decision making using edge computing.

AB  - Contactless monitoring of vital signs, e.g., heart rate (HR) attracts the researcher's attention due to its convenience and affordability. Among others, under-mattress ballistocardiogram (BCG) sensors have proved effective for contactless remote monitoring of HR. Nevertheless, HR detection from BCG sensors is a challenging task because the signal morphology can vary between and within-subjects. In this paper, we studied the potential of two wavelet-based methods, i.e., the multiresolution analysis of the maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT-MRA) and continuous wavelet transform (CWT) for HR detection via a microbend fiber optic sensor (MFOS). BCG signals were gathered from ten sleep apnea patients during overnight polysomnography (PSG) study. The MFOS was placed under the bed mattress and the PSG electrocardiogram (ECG) signals were used as a reference to evaluate the proposed HR detection algorithms. Overall, CWT with derivative of Gaussian provided (Gaus2) slightly better results compared with the MODWT-MRA, CWT (frequency Bspline), and CWT (Shannon). Across the ten patients, the mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error, and root mean square error metrics were as follows: 4.71 (1.22), 7.58% (2.17), and 5.58 (1.20), and 4.71 (1.07), 7.61% (1.65), and 5.59 (1.02), for Gau2 and MODWT-MRA, respectively. That said, the total precision for MODWT-MRA, i.e., 80.22 (19.01) was higher than Gaus2, i.e., 78.83 (17.84).

AB  - Egocentric activity recognition, also known as first-person vision, captures human actions and activities from the perspective of a wearable camera, providing a personalized and contextualized viewpoint. This unique perspective is crucial for various real-world applications, including healthcare monitoring, sports analy-sis, augmented reality, and assistive technologies. In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of various state-of-the-art algorithms for egocentric action recognition using the recently curated dataset, “Coer_Egovision.” This dataset captures human actions and activities from the unique perspective of a wearable camera, providing a personalized and context-aware viewpoint. Such a perspective holds significant value for real-world applications, including healthcare monitoring, sports analysis, augmented reality, and assistive technologies.The “Coer_Egovision” dataset encompasses diverse actions, such as “Going_Downstairs”, “Going_Upstairs”, “Texting”, “Walking” and “Writing” allowing for a challenging benchmark to evaluate algorithms in this domain. By leveraging the wearable camera perspective, the dataset addresses the need for a more com-prehensive understanding of human interactions with the environment.Among the evaluated algorithms, the Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Network (LRCN) emerges as the top performer, achieving an impressive accuracy of 88% in effectively modeling long-term temporal dependencies. Additionally, the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) combined with Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach demonstrates robust performance with 82% accuracy, highlighting the efficacy of feature-based methods. The study also reveals promising results for the 2-Stream Approach with 3D CNN and LSTM, achieving an accuracy of 74%. Furthermore, pretrained models like VGG16 and DenseNet201 along with LSTM exhibit competitive performances with accuracies of 80% each.These results offer valuable insights into the performance of diverse algorithms on the “Coer_Egovision” dataset, providing valuable guidance for future research in the field of egocentric action recognition.

This paper presents a smart telehealth system that seamlessly integrates LLMs across two primary modules: Appointment Scheduling and Teleconsultation. Adhering to the principles of user-centered design (UCD), the proposed system aims to enhance the overall telehealth experience for both patients and healthcare providers. The Appointment Scheduling Module leverages natural language processing and intelligent scheduling algorithms to streamline appointment booking and optimize resource utilization. The Teleconsultation Module harnesses LLMs for accurate symptom interpretation, clinical decision support, and personalized care delivery during remote consultations. The Clinical Decision Support Module integrates LLMs with medical knowledge bases and evidence-based guidelines, providing health care providers with real-time, tailored recommendations for diagnosis and treatment planning. Finally, the Health Data Analytics Module employs LLMs to analyze aggregated health data, uncover population health trends, and generate comprehensive reports to drive informed decision-making and advance medical research. By seamlessly integrating LLMs throughout the telehealth workflow, this system aims to improve accessibility, effectiveness, and user satisfaction with remote health care services, ultimately paving the way for more personalized, data-driven, and collaborative healthcare delivery models.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) can now be used to automate healthcare facilities and make patient data available for use at any time and from any location via the Internet. Healthcare-related data is now shared and accessed via the host-based Internet paradigm. Latency, mobility, and security issues are all exacerbated by its location-dependent nature. For the present host-based Internet paradigm, which is already in place, NDN has been promoted as the next Internet paradigm. The new species, unfortunately, lacks a stable healthcare system. A lightweight certificate less (CLC) signature is used to build an NDN-IoMT framework in this paper. We employ the Hyper elliptic Curve Cryptosystem (HCC) since it is cheaper than the Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem, which provides higher security with a smaller key (ECC). In addition, we use AVISPA to verify the proposed scheme's safety. In order to determine the most cost-effective solution, we look at existing certificate less signature methods. Results reveal that our proposed method utilizes very little network resources. Finally, we put the architecture into action on NDN-IoMT.

AB  - Medication for neurological diseases such as the Parkinson’s disease usually happens remotely away from hospitals. Such out-of-lab environments pose challenges in collecting timely and accurate health status data. Individual differences in behavioral signals collected from wearable sensors also lead to difficulties in adopting current general machine learning analysis pipelines. To address these challenges, we present a method for predicting the medication status of Parkinson’s disease patients using the public mPower dataset, which contains 62,182 remote multi-modal test records collected on smartphones from 487 patients. The proposed method shows promising results in predicting three medication statuses objectively: Before Medication (AUC=0.95), After Medication (AUC=0.958), and Another Time (AUC=0.976) by examining patient-wise historical records with the attention weights learned through a Transformer model. Our method provides an innovative way for personalized remote health sensing in a timely and objective fashion which could benefit a broad range of similar applications.

AB  - In recent times, there has been a notable rise in the utilization of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) frameworks particularly those based on edge computing, to enhance remote monitoring in healthcare applications. Most existing models in this field have been developed temperature screening methods using RCNN, face temperature encoder (FTE), and a combination of data from wearable sensors for predicting respiratory rate (RR) and monitoring blood pressure. These methods aim to facilitate remote screening and monitoring of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and COVID-19. However, these models require inadequate computing resources and are not suitable for lightweight environments. We propose a multimodal screening framework that leverages deep learning-inspired data fusion models to enhance screening results. A Variation Encoder (VEN) design proposes to measure skin temperature using Regions of Interest (RoI) identified by YoLo. Subsequently, the multi-data fusion model integrates electronic records features with data from wearable human sensors. To optimize computational efficiency, a data reduction mechanism is added to eliminate unnecessary features. Furthermore, we employ a contingent probability method to estimate distinct feature weights for each cluster, deepening our understanding of variations in thermal and sensory data to assess the prediction of abnormal COVID-19 instances. Simulation results using our lab dataset demonstrate a precision of 95.2%, surpassing state-of-the-art models due to the thoughtful design of the multimodal data-based feature fusion model, weight prediction factor, and feature selection model.

AB  - Technological advancements in medical field gave birth to smart watches, handheld devices that can read your vital signs real-time. However, home quarantined COVID-19 patients, even with the help of smartwatches, are still needed to be monitored physically by health practitioners, therefore posing a threat of transmission of the virus. This paved the way to the investigation of designing a wearable device that read health vital statistics and the location of home quarantined patients and a system that will remotely monitor it. Thus, this work developed Vitaband, a health-monitoring system made up of a node, gateway, and a web application. The node consists of sensors – pulse meter, oximeter, IR sensor and GPS module – that will read the vital signs of the patient and display it through an OLED screen. Two Raspberry Pico Pi microcontrollers will process the data gathered by these sensors and send them to the gateway through the Lora module. The gateway then, housing the ESP32 microcontroller, will connect to the internet and transmit the received data to the MongoDB database. The web application finally, which is programmed using REACT framework, shall display the data for remote monitoring. Vitaband is tested and evaluated using the ISO/IEC 25010 model. Results revealed that Vitaband received an overall rating of Very Satisfactory from the Bulacan State University Nursing student during their training as the respondents and Excellent from medical professionals which are registered nurses and barangay health workers, respectively.

AB  - The advent of Internet of Things (IoT) has escalated the information sharing among various smart devices by many folds, irrespective of their geographical locations. Recently, applications like e-healthcare monitoring has attracted wide attention from the research community, where both the security and the effectiveness of the system are greatly imperative. However, to the best of our knowledge none of the existing literature can accomplish both these objectives (e.g., existing systems are not secure against physical attacks). This paper addresses the shortcomings in existing IoT-based healthcare system. We propose an enhanced system by introducing a Physical Unclonable Function (PUF)-based authentication scheme and a data driven fault-tolerant decision-making scheme for designing an IoT-based modern healthcare system. Analyses show that our proposed scheme is more secure and efficient than existing systems. Hence, it will be useful in designing an advanced IoT-based healthcare system.

AB  - Nowadays, Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic because of its fast spread in vari-ous countries. To build an anti-epidemic barrier, self-isolation is required for people who have been to any at-risk places or have been in close contact with infected people. However, existing camera or wearable device-based monitoring systems may present privacy leakage risks or cause user inconvenience in some cases. In this paper, we propose a Wi-Fi-based device-free self-quarantine monitoring system. Specifically, we exploit channel state information (CSI) derived from Wi-Fi signals as human activity features. We collect CSI data in a simulated self-quarantine scenario and present BranchyGhostNet, a lightweight convolution neural network (CNN) with an early exit prediction branch, for the efficient joint task of room occupancy detection (ROD) and human activity recognition (HAR). The early exiting branch is used for ROD, and the final one is used for HAR. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed model can achieve an average accuracy of 98.19% for classifying five different human activities. They also confirm that after leveraging the early exit prediction mechanism, the inference latency for ROD can be significantly reduced by 54.04% when compared with the final exiting branch while guaranteeing the accuracy of ROD.

AB  - The deployment of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMTs) for remote monitoring has grown exponentially as an alternative for in-hospital diagnosis. The COVID-19 lockdown and the shortage of human and medical apparatus pushed the detection and diagnostics toward the Wireless Body Area Network to prevent the spread of infection. In this paper, we present a novel approach to detect cardiovascular diseases using the IoMTs. The proposed approach is based on the use of autoencoders to derive a compressed representation of the input record, followed by a Random Forest to classify the latent data. The objective is to provide a lightweight and accurate model compatible with the constrained resources of sensors. Our experiment results on a public annotated dataset show that our approach can enhance the performance where the obtained area under the curve is 89%. We also compare the performance of widely used classification algorithms to prove the efficiency of our proposed model.

AB  - The fight against pandemics is redesigning the interaction between doctor and patients with a clear request of remote monitoring of biological parameters, reducing the proximity. At this purpose, physical and chemical sensors placed on the skin with wireless reading, can provide the early detection of psycho-physical diseases. A plug&play epidermal patch based on Radiofrequency Identification technology is here proposed for the simultaneous remote reading of multi-physical and -chemical parameters of the skin. The board is designed to improve the usability of the device and to ease the experimentation of different disposable sensors. The resulting prototype made of biocompatible and comfortable encapsulation is readable up to 2 m in battery-assisted mode and up to 80 cm without embedded power source (passive mode). Sensing experimentation was preliminary performed on the bench through the triple measurement of two chemical sensors (pH and sodium concentration) together with temperature, under controlled conditions.

AB  - Over the years, the healthcare industry has transformed from being hospital-centric to patient-centric. This shift is mainly due to the convergence of emergent technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT)-based healthcare, fifth generation (5G)-assisted networking, and data-driven analytics through artificial intelligence. The convergence, referred to as Healthcare 5.0, has improved healthcare services to support real-time analytics, user mobility, remote monitoring, and personalized user experience through decentralized applications. However, the medical supply chain systems and delivery operations among healthcare stakeholders suffer from limitations of harsh environmental conditions due to restricted zones, rough terrains, war-prone areas, poor road conditions, congested traffic, and remote locations. Thus, the Internet of Drones (IoD) is deployed in Healthcare 5.0 supply chains to streamline and expedite the medical delivery process through open channels (i.e. the Internet). However, the Internet is an open channel that is prone to malicious activities which can violate the privacy and confidentiality of patient data. Blockchain is a promising technology that can handle the security and reliability of drone delivery among untrusted open channels. Motivated by the aforementioned facts, we propose GaRuDa, a blockchain-based drone delivery scheme for Healthcare 5.0 applications. The proposed scheme integrates IoD and blockchain through 5G-enabled tactile Internet to facilitate low-latency responsive delivery of medical supplies that can be chronologically monitored and tracked among different stakeholders. We compared the proposed scheme with the traditional medical delivery scheme with payment gateways to demonstrate its effectiveness in terms of data storage, computation, and communication costs. The simulation results obtained show that the average transaction cost has been reduced by ≈ 44.56 percent, and 5G tactile Internet has a reduced latency of 0.051 ms compared to 18.3 ms in 4G LTE service. The average communication overheads have reduced by ≈ 67.34 percent compared to traditional 4G LTE and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing channels, which indicates the scheme's viability.

AB  - Confronted with the COVID-19 health crisis, the year 2020 represented a turning point for the entire world. It paved the way for health-care systems to reaffirm their foundations by using different technologies such as sensors, wearables, mobile applications, drones, robots, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) and the Internet of Things (IoT). A lot of domains have been renovated such as diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring, as well as previously unprecedented domains such as contact tracing. Contact tracing, in conjunction with the emergence, spread, and public compliance for vaccines, was a critical step for controlling and limiting the spread of the pandemic. Traditional contact tracing is usually dependent on individuals ability to recall their interactions, which is challenging and yet not effective. Consequently, further development and usage of automated, privacy-preserving, digital contact-tracing was required. As the pandemic is coming to an end, it is vital to collect and learn the effective used technologies that aided in fighting the virus in order to be prepared for any future pandemics and to be aware of any literature gaps that must be filled. This paper surveys state-of-the-art architectures, platforms, and applications combating COVID-19 at each phase of the five basic contact tracing phases, including case identification, contacts identification and rapid exposure notification, surveillance, regular follow up and prevention. In addition, there is a phase of preparation and post-pandemic services for current and needed future technology that will aid in the fight against any incoming infectious diseases.

AB  - In today’s world of medical science, remote patient monitoring devices are becoming more important and a future need particularly in the present COVID-19 situation as individuals are preferred to be kept isolated. Patients would be benefited from a suitable monitoring system that measures their important medical parameters such as pulse rate, oxygen saturation or SpO2, body temperature, blood pressure, and Galvanized Skin Response (GSR). This system can increase the medical staff efficiency by drastically decreasing their duties in hospitals and the need to attend to them individually. Patients in their home isolation may utilize the device as well, and their vital indicators may be checked by doctors remotely. In this work, we are prototyping a powerefficient, wearable medical kit and a resource-aware fog network set up to handle the Internet of Things (IoT) data traffic. The idea behind the design is to process the critical medical sensors’ data in the fog nodes which are deployed at the edge of the network. The data thus received, is used for a machine learning-based solution for personal health anomalies and COVID-19 infection risk analysis.

AB  - In the pursuit of advancing healthcare technologies and promoting the well-being of the elderly population, this paper presents a conceptual framework for early detection of gait disorders through public IoT-based health monitoring. As global life expectancy continues to rise, there is an increasing need for unobtrusive health monitoring systems that can facilitate the early identification of health issues, particularly among the elderly. While many healthcare monitoring technologies exist, their limited accessibility and deployment in controlled environments or healthcare facilities present challenges. To address this, our innovative concept proposes a smart IoT-based outdoor health monitoring system, specifically designed for public spaces such as parks and supermarkets. This system aims to collect data on mobility, posture, and gait, recognising the crucial role that gait plays in an individual's well-being. The proposed system leverages the power of the Internet of Things (IoT) to gather data seamlessly from individuals in their everyday environments, creating a more holistic and real-world understanding of their health. By analysing gait patterns and deviations, our conceptual framework aims to serve as an early warning system for health-care providers, caregivers, and individuals themselves, alerting them to potential health concerns and enabling proactive intervention. This concept, while in its early stages, holds immense promise for addressing the challenges of an ageing population and reducing healthcare disparities. It aligns with the broader vision of harnessing emerging technologies to enhance the quality of life for the elderly.

AB  - Several healthcare applications have been launched in recent years to enhance the healthcare sector. The emergence of miniature medical sensors to track patients’ vital signs has strengthened and enhanced the human healthcare system. The objective of this initiative is to improve healthcare security by integrating IoT and blockchain technology to preserve patient data and enable remote vital sign monitoring. Vital sign monitoring has been greatly enhanced by the widespread use of tiny medical sensors, which have increased data availability for early diagnosis and therapy recommendations. Nonetheless, there are issues with guaranteeing data security and privacy with the current technologies. Blockchain technology is included in the suggested solution because of its special qualities, which include transparency and data privacy. IoT sensors are used to gather patient data, like temperature, heart rate, and oxygen saturation levels, which are then safely sent via Postman API to a private permissioned blockchain. With a key size of 256 bits, the data is encrypted using SHA 256, creating public and private keys for further protection. Specialist physicians are able to read documents pertinent to their areas of expertise since access restriction is applied through private channels. In order to guarantee a strong and safe healthcare environment, the research also incorporates an easy-to-use interface for hospital managers to manage appointments, ambulance reservations, and get notifications when vital indicators surpass threshold levels.

AB  - A dual-channel single-mode-multi-mode-single-mode (SMS) fiber optic sensor encapsulated by polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was proposed for the first time, for the simultaneous monitoring of the brachial and radial arteries for accurate blood pressure prediction. With the help of the machine learning algorithm Support Vector Regression (SVR), the SMS fiber sensor can continuously and accurately monitor the systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Commercial sphygmomanometers are used to calibrate the accuracy of blood pressure measurement. Compared with the single-channel system, this system can extract more pulse wave features for blood pressure prediction, such as radial artery transit time (RPTT), brachial artery transit time (BPTT), and the transit time difference between the radial artery and the brachial artery (DBRPTT). The results show that the performance of dual-channel blood pressure monitoring is more accurate than that of single-channel blood pressure monitoring in terms of the absolute value of the correlation coefficient (R) and the average value of the difference between SBP and DBP. In addition, both the single-channel and dual-channel blood pressure monitoring are in line with the Association for the Advancement of Medical Devices (AAMI), but the average deviation (DM, 0.06 mmHg) and standard deviation (SD, 1.54 mmHg) of dual-channel blood pressure monitoring are more accurate. The blood pressure monitoring system has the characteristics of low cost, high sensitivity, non-invasive and capability for remote real time monitoring, which can provide effective solution for intelligent health monitoring in the era of artificial intelligence in the future.

We then propose a reference architecture for a future eHealth infrastructure, which is a fusion of cloud, edge, IoT, and other emerging technologies. Finally, to evalu-ate the proposed architecture, we implement a remote patient monitoring service comprising the architecture components and enablers, i.e., mobile device sensors and distributed intelligent data analysis. The evaluation shows an effective integration of artificial intelligence (AI) components to support novel eHealth applications.

AB  - Nowadays the health-monitoring scenario increasingly demands acquisition platforms able to collect at the same time multiple bio-signals. The main engineering challenge is to make these multi-nodes platforms fully wireless and wearable, allowing their use during daily life activities. In order to keep sensing nodes synchronized with each other, these systems need structured wireless architectures (i.e. synchronization engines). In this paper we propose a quantitative analysis to evaluate and to improve the wireless synchronization engine of an innovative wearable multi-node monitoring platform. We exploited the data collector as time-logger and we evaluated data about synchronization delay during the tuning of different architecture parameters. In particular, we performed several data collections evaluating a range of different frequencies used to exchange synchronization packets and testing the introduction of a dynamic adaption in the Connection Interval (a specific Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) parameter). We achieved the overall best performance (1,18 16-MHz-ticks as synchronization delay median value, with 1,60 16-MHz-ticks as Min-Max range) adopting both 40 Hz as synchronization frequency and the Connection Interval dynamic adaption. Our final goal is to investigate the most performing settings in order to increase the quality of physiological data collected with the platform under analysis, considering the lower the synchronization delay, the higher the data quality.

AB  - Heart failure exacerbations (HFE) represent a critical challenge in healthcare due to their significant role in global mortality. The rise of home and wearable devices capable of monitoring cardiac conditions provides valuable opportunities for data-driven analysis and HFE detection. However, these devices frequently generate low-quality measurements with irregular sampling frequencies and high rates of missing data. Our paper presents a methodology that processes these measurements as a three-dimensional tensor, applying a low-rank tensor completion scheme to manage missing data effectively, thus facilitating anomaly detection without necessitating data imputation. We validate our method on a dataset from 4 patients with chronic HF in the compensation phase, collected at the Hospital Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Campus Bio-Medico in Rome, Italy. Our results demonstrate the tensor-based method’s superiority over traditional techniques, highlighting its potential for detecting anomalies within complex multivariate time series data. This research emphasizes the critical role of advanced data analysis in enhancing HFE identification, which could lead to improved patient care and reduced hospitalization rates.

AB  - Technological development expands the computation process of smart devices that adopt the telecare medical information system (TMIS) to fulfill the demands of the healthcare organization. It provides better medical identification to claim the features namely trustworthy, efficient, and resourceful. Moreover, the telecare services automate the remote healthcare monitoring process to ease professional workloads. Importantly, it is conceived to be more timesaving, economical, and easy healthcare access. Cloud-Based Medical Healthcare (CBMH) system is a standard platform that gives its support to the patients for emergency treatment from the medical experts over Internet communication. Since the medical records are very sensitive, security protection is much necessitated. In addition, patient anonymity should be well preserved. In 2016, Chiou et al. proposed a mutual authentication protocol for the Telecare Medical Information System (TMIS) using Cloud Environment (CE). They claim that their protocol satisfies patient anonymity. However, this paper proves that the Chiou et al. scheme is not only completely insecure against the patient anonymity, health-report revelation, health-report forgery, report confidentiality, and non-repudiation but also fails to validate the service access against verifiability, undeniability and unforgeability. In order to provide better mutual authenticity, this paper suggests the framework of smart service authentication to cross-examine the common secret session key among the communication entities. In order to examine the security properties, formal and informal verification was carried out. Lastly, to prove the security and performance efficiency of a system, the proposed SSA framework was implemented using FPGA and Moteiv TMote Sky-Mote. A proposed smart service authentication (SSA) framework is presented to ensure better data security between the patients and the physicians. The formal and informal security analysis proves the significance of the SSA framework model to withstand the security attacks such as health-report forgery, health-report revelation, server-spoofing etc. As a result, it is claimed that it can be well suited for TMIS.

AB  - Asthma and other respiratory diseases impose a significant global burden, affecting millions of individuals and placing substantial strain on health care systems. The domain of healthcare has witnessed transformative advancements through the integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, fostering the emergence of patient-centric solutions. Respiratory ailments pose significant challenges to patients, necessitating precise management and monitoring. Existing conventional inhalers often lack automation, real time monitoring, data driven insights and overall polish that leads to suboptimal treatment, but in no way, it could match with other peripherals which have advanced quite significantly over the years. Our proposed solution presents an IoT-based smart inhaler that seamlessly captures inhalation data, securely transmits it to the cloud, and employs data analytics to offer personalized recommendations. One of the key innovations of our project is the integration of real-time monitoring and feedback. By equipping the Nebulizer device with sensors and communication modules, we empower users with instant insights into their Nebulizer usage patterns. Comparison reveals that while conventional inhalers offer basic functionality, they lack the data-driven insights and remote monitoring capabilities of the IoT smart nebulizer. Future enhancements can encompass AI-driven predictive analytics, enabling early detection of exacerbations, and incorporation of wearable respiratory sensors for a comprehensive health overview.

AB  - Long-term blood pressure (BP) monitoring is a widely used approach in a homecare intelligent system. However, BP is usually measured using cuff-based devices with tedious operation in practice, which may not be cost effective for continuous BP tracking. In this article, we propose a novel attention-based multitask network with a weighting scheme for BP estimation by analyzing and modeling single lead electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method could achieve mean error of systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and mean arterial pressure estimation in levels of 0.18 ± 10.83, 1.24 ± 5.90, and 0.84 ± 6.47 mmHg, respectively. In comparison to other cutting-edge methods using ECG signals, the proposed method shows superior BP estimation performance. By integrating with a wearable/portable ECG monitoring device, the proposed model can be deployed to an embedded system or remote healthcare intelligent system to provide long-term BP monitoring service, which would help to reduce the incidence of malignant events happened in hypertensive population.

AB  - Advanced sensing technologies such as remote sensing and sensor networks, important for enhancing land use through soil condition monitoring, are facing issues including high machine learning costs, limited measurement point density, and environmental impact. This study introduces a remote sensing method that offers both direct and wide-area sensing of soil properties using a dispersible, biodegradable cuboid-shaped isotropic metamaterial equipped with a water-soluble Mg-based resonance antenna structure. The symmetrical metal patterns ensure isotropic reflectance within the 1.2–3.6-GHz range, enabling robust sensing even when the metamaterial is dispersed randomly on the soil. The degradation of the Mg antenna in the soil presents a significant reflection reduction from 80% to 20% at a 2.4-GHz resonant frequency on the soil, promoting the feasibility of combination with a simple wireless measurement system. Integration with functional coatings that dissolve in response to specific soil substances such as pH-sensitive hydroxyapatite leads to the development of biodegradable soil remote monitoring sensors, offering precise, sustainable land management.

AB  - The advent of Internet of Things (IoT) revolutionizes the healthcare sector by altering how medical equipment and humans interact while providing healthcare solutions. Applications of IoT in healthcare are advantageous to patients, their families, physicians, hospitals, and insurance companies. Before the IoT, patients could only speak with doctors physically, over the phone, or by text. There wasn’t a practical way for medical staff or facilities to continuously assess patients' health and provide guidance. Remote monitoring in the healthcare industry is made possible by utilizing sensor devices that help physicians to deliver superlative care to their patients. Sensor devices play a crucial role in the remote monitoring of patients. However, the failure of network or sensor devices may result in data with missing values. This incomplete data cannot be utilized to diagnose a patient or to make effective predictions of the disease in early diagnosis. To ensure the effective diagnosis and predict the risk of diseases in the patient, this paper proposed a novel ReMiss (Removing Missingness in medical datasets) algorithm to impute the missing values present in incomplete medical datasets. The proposed ReMiss algorithm is a data-partitioning based missing values imputation technique that partitions the datasets into complete and incomplete subsets to predict the missing values efficiently. The adjusted coefficient of determination, RMSEs and classification accuracy are the performance metrics used to evaluate the performance of the proposed ReMiss algorithm with the existing imputation techniques. The proposed ReMiss algorithm obtained an average classification accuracy of 93.53%.

AB  - Human activity recognition (HAR) based on wearable sensors has emerged as an active topic of research in machine learning and human behavior analysis because of its applications in several fields, including health, security and surveillance, and remote monitoring. Machine learning algorithms are frequently applied in HAR systems to learn from labeled sensor data. The effectiveness of these algorithms generally relies on having access to lots of accurately labeled training data. But labeled data for HAR is hard to come by and is often heavily imbalanced in favor of one or other dominant classes, which in turn leads to poor recognition performance. In this study we introduce a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based approach for HAR that we use to automatically synthesize balanced and realistic sensor data. GANs are robust generative networks, typically used to create synthetic images that cannot be distinguished from real images. Here we explore and construct a model for generating several types of human activity sensor data using a Wasserstein GAN (WGAN). We assess the synthetic data using two commonly-used classifier models, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). We evaluate the quality and diversity of the synthetic data by training on synthetic data and testing on real sensor data, and vice versa. We then use synthetic sensor data to oversample the imbalanced training set. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method on two publicly available human activity datasets, the Sussex-Huawei Locomotion (SHL) and Smoking Activity Dataset (SAD). We achieve improvements of using WGAN augmented training data over the imbalanced case, for both SHL (0.85 to 0.95 F1-score), and for SAD (0.70 to 0.77 F1-score) when using a CNN activity classifier.

AB  - In a heterogeneous wireless environment, there are many different radio access technologies (RATs), such as Wi-Fi and 2G, 3G, 4G, and 5G, which each have a different degree of coverage and processing power to meet various service requirements. A mobile user may have access to various access networks in such a situation. On the PC of each user, numerous programs with varied Quality of Service (QoS) requirements can operate simultaneously. It would be advantageous for a multi-interface terminal to use two or more interfaces simultaneously in order to improve performance. However, using multiple networks at once could use up more energy than just using one interface. Therefore, energy use must to be taken into account when analyzing the Flow/Interface Relationship (FIA). This paper presents a novel method for choosing the ideal FIA that achieves the best trade-off between all the characteristics taken into account, dubbed Smart Tabu Search (STS). STS considers user preferences, network circumstances, network expenses, application QoS specifications, and battery life of mobile devices. We use simulations and testbed experiments to validate our concept. Professionals are now able to diagnose and monitor patients remotely because to the growing use of healthcare monitoring devices. One of the most frequent occurrences that affects the reliability of information transmission in any network is congestion, which is defined as the unchecked increase in traffic relative to network capacity. With the use of a mesh network, wireless sensors, and some of the most significant models for vital signs, the article aims to provide a realistic simulation environment for a healthcare system. The simulator environment is a helpful tool for assessing the dependability and effectiveness of the healthcare system in a realistic setting. However, the system is not appropriate for real-time applications due to the sluggish network adaption caused by the end-to-end based traffic regulation decision. In more recent scheduling techniques, additional scheduling factors were taken into account, including the priority order of inserting packets using a fixed priority algorithm based on Priority Queuing (PQ), user-defined. Context priorities, user-defined profile priorities, the applications and devices that are currently active, the number of their direct neighboring nodes, the average link quality, and user preferences. A cutting-edge paradigm for communication called the Internet of Things (IoT) permits online connections between parts from various domains. The traditional healthcare system has a growing need for social resources like doctors, nurses, hospital beds, and health monitoring gadgets, making modern healthcare one of the most alluring IoT applications. In this paper, a design for a small wearable sensor patch that can gauge body temperature, photo plethysmography, and the electrocardiogram (ECG) is given. The suggested sensor patch can be used to constantly estimate blood pressure (BP) based on the pulse arrival time (PAT) without the need for additional cables or equipment because ECG and PPG sensors are combined in one device. Three sensors are used to monitor vital signs, a central board is used to analyze and collect signals, and a power board is used to provide power and charge batteries. The entire set of parts is made with a rigid-flexible construction that permits rapid attachment to the body for applications like remote health monitoring. For specialized measurements of a particular physiological signal (such an ECG), the sensors can be taken out of the main board in order to save power. By comparing the suggested sensor patch to a commercial reference device, experiments are done to verify its performance. A tiny Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) module that enables wireless transfer of physiological parameters to a 1/4 SeThe suggested sensor system includes a tiny Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) module that enables wireless communication of physiological values to a gateway. In order to safeguard data while it is being transmitted for security and privacy reasons, both the sensor and the data are encrypted. The wearable sensor system is linked to the Internet cloud, where health data can be kept and later reviewed, by means of a stationary gateway based on laptops and a mobile gateway based on smartphones. The results of the testing show that the platform is viable for use in IoT-connected healthcare applications.

AB  - During the recent COVID-19 pandemic, Medical Body area networks (MBANs) emerged as an essential tool for the early diagnosis and treatment of infected patients. MBANs played an instrumental role in the remote treatment of COVID patients through early diagnosis using machine learning and IoT (Internet of Things). MBANs have paved their way in the health care industry and are being used in remote monitoring, emergency handling, and elderly assistance. The availability of the IEEE 802.15.6 standard has opened doors for new wearable consumer devices and IoMT (Internet of Medical Things) enabled applications to facilitate disease management. This standard was developed for wireless communication at a short-range, around the human body with low power requirements. This standard allows 2hop star topology within an intra-MBAN so that when direct communication is not possible, alternate routes are available through relays. This paper proposes a protocol for an intra-MBAN topology, which is a novel T-Relay mechanism that implements the 2-hop star topology. To validate the proposed protocol, it was tested on OMNeT ++ framework with Castalia Simulator for various scenarios. The simulation results show that the T-Relay mechanism enhances the PDR when the channel has variations.

AB  - Pervasive healthcare services have evolved substantially in the recent years with IoMT rapidly changing the pace and scale of healthcare delivery. A promising application of IoMT is to fetch patterns of mental behaviour symptomatology based on bio-signals and transfer it to the corresponding hospital or psychologist for remote monitoring. But the data volume & performance, device diversity & interoperability, hacking & unauthorized use and acceptance & adoption barriers still restrain the practical and competent use of these devices. This research presents a plausible solution to surmount the data overload and processing latency in real-time sensory data collected through wearable devices for mental health monitoring. We propose a modified k-medoid data clustering technique based on time-frame restricted intra-cluster similarity calculations to obtain a summarized version of the original benchmark WESAD dataset for which the degree of information lost is minimum. A CNN is then trained on this summarized dataset for classification of mental state into the baseline, stress and amusement categories. The results show a significant reduction in the average execution time by 34% with a comparable accuracy to the original dataset, thus offering prompt real-time healthcare analytics.

AB  - Following the standardization and deployment of the 5G network, researchers have shifted their focus to beyond 5G (B5G) communication. Existing technologies have brought forth a plethora of applications that could not have been imagined in the past years. B5G will enable us to rethink the capability it will offer in various sectors, including agriculture, search and rescue, and, more specifically, in the delivery of health-care services. Unobtrusive and noninvasive measurements using radio-frequency (RF) sensing, monitoring, and the control of wearable medical devices are the areas that would potentially benefit from B5G. Applications such as RF sensing, device charging, and remote patient monitoring will be a key challenge in using millimeter-wave (mm-wave) communication. The mm-waves experience multipath-induced fading, where the rate of attenuation is larger as compared to microwaves. Eventually, mm-wave communication systems would require range extenders and guided surfaces. A proposed solution is the use of intelligent reflective surfaces, which will have the ability to manipulate electromagnetic (EM) signals. These intelligent surfaces mounted and/or coated on walls, also known as intelligent walls (IWs), are planar and active surfaces, which will be a key element in B5G and 6G communication. These intelligent walls, equipped with a machine learning (ML) algorithm and computation power, would have the ability to manipulate EM waves and act as gateways in the heterogeneous network environment. The article presents the application and vision of intelligent walls for next-generation health care in the era of B5G.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) for medical purposes offers a number of benefits, including the aptitude to follow the individual's physical state over a range of time intervals and transmitting data in real time. Using gadgets like glucose meters, heart monitoring implants, Electrocardiogram (ECG), blood pressure monitors, Electroencephalography (EEG) and Electromyography (EMG) wearable strategies, medical personnel can gather local patient wellness data and make choices based on it. The IoT devices' weak authentication and encryption procedures make them readily hackable and may expose users to a number of risks, some of which could be fatal. The Quality of Service (QoS) needs for healthcare IoT devices, such as dependability, authorization, identity and security, cannot be met by current algorithms using machine learning or blockchain approaches operating in the cloud computing environment. Henceforth the proposed work develops an advanced Fog computing (FC) to oppose advance cloud computing at an edge of networks together with Block chain topology. Fog computing has been emphasized as promising method for low-cost remote monitoring, limiting down on latency, and boosting efficiency, while blockchain has been touted for guaranteeing the security of private data, building a decentralized database, and improving data interoperability. The problem of healthcare IoT device recognition, permission and confirmation for scalability often broadcast of data in a distributed setting can be handled by merging FC with block chain. So, leveraging FC and blockchain, a creative solution to the aforementioned issue.

AB  - The papers in this special section focus on federal learning applications for the Internet of Medical Things. Due to to the advancements in Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), wearable devices, remote monitoring of patients is possible like never before. Machine learning and deep learning techniques help the doctors immensely in remotely diagnosing the patients by learning the patterns from the data generated through these devices [1]. The main problem with traditional machine learning (ML)/deep learning (DL) models is that the data from the individual devices, sensors, wearables of patients have to be transferred to the central servers to train the data using the ML/DL models. Due to the sensitive nature of the healthcare data, the aforementioned approach of transferring the patients’ data to the central servers may create serious security and privacy issues.
