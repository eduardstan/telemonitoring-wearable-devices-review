AB  - Remote patient monitoring (RPM) is an innovative strategy to promote health and improve patient management and care. Recent advances in healthcare technologies have seen the emergence of wearable sensors allowing longitudinal physiological measurements in any environment. This paper introduces a wireless wearable patch ‘Leo’ for continuous remote monitoring of physiological data at home and healthcare settings. This includes single lead ECG, chest impedance, heart rate (HR), respiration rate (RR) and body posture. To test Leo’s ability to capture longitudinal physiological data at home, 15 children experiencing acute severe asthma exacerbations were recruited during their emergency department (ED) visits. Participants wore the Leo device for 7 (+/-2) days post-hospital discharge. Nocturnal RR and HR and variability were higher during the first half of the night on Day1 compared to Day7 (p<0.005). Participants also completed a usability questionnaire and reported the patch wear to be comfortable (average score of 3.3 out of 5) and easy to wear during the night (average score of 3.5 out of 5) with 5/15 (33%) reported very slight barely perceptible skin irritation/redness and 2 (13%) reported well defined skin irritation and redness.Clinical Relevance— These results highlight the potential use of the Leo device in clinical practice for continuous un-obstructive monitoring of diseased populations, such as asthma.

AB  - Wearable devices have received tremendous interest in healthcare monitoring due to their significant advantages in terms of flexibility, noninvasiveness, wireless capability, and portability. However, they still face challenges, including the need for external power sources, bulky measuring instruments, and a lack of a wireless data transport system. Herein, we propose a PEDOT:PSS/MXene pressure sensing platform based on 2-D e-textile and screen-printed interdigitated electrodes (IDEs). Both materials improve the electrical conductivity, sensitivity, stability, flexibility, and mechanical durability of the pressure sensor. A near-field communication (NFC) readout system provides real-time wireless monitoring by transmitting signals from the sensor to a smartphone app, without external batteries. The pressure sensor has sensitivity, a wide detection range, excellent repeatability and stability, fast response/recovery time, and long-term durability. Long-term usability was verified through the bending test up to 21400 cycles. The flexible pressure sensor successfully monitored wrist pulse, physical movements, and various muscle movements in the body. Repeatable, stable, reliable, and regular signals were obtained wirelessly through the NFC readout system. Our sensing platform could be a promising solution for healthcare monitoring, rehabilitation therapy, and early medical diagnosis. In addition, it suggests a new platform for helping people with disabilities to communicate with others through human–machine interaction.

AB  - Technological advancements have facilitated the development of innovative wearable electrocardiography (ECG) patches suitable for remote patient monitoring. However, there is a current lack of comprehensive understanding regarding the user experience (UX) associated with these devices which is crucial to ensure their widespread acceptance. This research aims to present a design for a wireless ECG patch (WEP) that focuses on user experience features, making it easy to operate and integrate into daily routines. Initially, we surveyed 50 participants to discern the pertinent criteria for the user experience (UX) design of commercial ECG patches. Our approach integrated existing research findings and incorporated technical considerations mandated by project stakeholders. Subsequently, an expert panel comprising a designer, technical experts, and a physician selected the optimal design concept. Following the development of the prototype, it underwent a 48-hour user experience investigation, which involved a questionnaire and an overview assessment. A significant majority of participants reported that the device was comfortable to wear and easy to use. Additionally, the study participants expressed satisfaction and indicated a keen interest in utilizing the device in the future. These results affirm that the newly designed WEP is a reliable, comfortable, and user-friendly device for remote patient monitoring, hinting at the potential for such devices to enhance patient care and improve overall health outcomes through further development and adoption.

AB  - This paper aims to present an IoT-based wearable health monitoring device and medical emergency response system to improve healthcare services. The wearable device collects vital health data such as oxygen level (MAX30100), heart rate (MAX30100) and body temperature (DS18B20) and transmits it to a centralized system for real-time monitoring to detect anomalies and potential medical emergencies, triggering immediate alerts. The system collects data from the sensors and then transmits it wirelessly through Microcontroller to a cloud-based platform for storage and analysis. To evaluate the system's effectiveness, a simulator is developed to replicate real-world scenarios. A portable mobile app monitors the patient's heartbeat, body temperature, and oxygen level in this study. A continual checking and control device employing Wi-Fi Module-based remote correspondence would screen the patient's state and store their data on a server. This research demonstrates the potential of IoT technology to revolutionize healthcare delivery, enabling early detection of critical conditions and improving patient outcomes. The integration of wearable health monitoring devices and medical emergency response systems provides a comprehensive solution to enhance the overall healthcare ecosystem. This research establishes a foundation for future developments in this field.

AB  - As the population of the elderly in the world continues its rapid surge, more attention must be drawn towards remote health monitoring (RHM), early diagnosis, and preventive interventions to sustain health care and eldercare. Elderly gait is a sensitive marker for their health status which enables detection of physical and mental impairments. This study aimed to advance the performance of elderly gait event detection using a single waist-worn IMU sensor through deep learning models. Four deep learning models MLP, CNN, LSTM, and GRU were trained and tested on data from the community-dwelling elderly. The accuracy was measured for six detection delay tolerance ranges. The GRU model achieved the best accuracy of 99.47% at a detection delay tolerance range of ±6TS (±6ms) and 78.98% for a more precise range of ±1TS (±1ms). The proposed method showed significant improvement over previously reported event detection results by achieving an MAE of 8.9ms and 7.6ms for the HS and TO events respectively. The RNN models attained better accuracy for the TO events as compared to HS events. Furthermore, an ablation study was also performed to observe the contribution of the subsets of the six IMU signals from the pelvis to the overall performance of the best model. The study showed that deep learning-based methods are much superior to previously reported methods for gait event detection through the pelvis sensor and it is expected to bring new attention towards practical waist-worn wearable devices for the health and condition monitoring of the elderly.

AB  - Telemonitoring is a branch of telehealth that aims at remotely monitoring vital signs, which is important for chronically ill patients and the elderly living alone. The available standalone devices and applications for the self-monitoring of health parameters largely suffer from interoperability problems; meanwhile, telemonitoring medical devices are expensive, self-contained, and are not integrated into user-friendly technological platforms for the end user. This paper presents the technical aspects and usability assessment of the telemonitoring features of the HEREiAM platform, which supports heterogeneous information technology systems. By exploiting a service-oriented architecture, the measured parameters collected by off-the-shelf Bluetooth medical devices are sent as XML documents to a private cloud that implements an interoperable health service infrastructure, which is compliant with the most recent healthcare standards and security protocols. This Android-based system is designed to be accessible both via TV and portable devices, and includes other utilities designed to support the elderly living alone. Four usability assessment sessions with quality-validated questionnaires were performed to accurately understand the ease of use, usefulness, acceptance, and quality of the proposed system. The results reveal that our system achieved very high usability scores even at its first use, and the scores did not significantly change over time during a field trial that lasted for four months, reinforcing the idea of an intuitive design. At the end of such a trial, the user-experience questionnaire achieved excellent scores in all aspects with respect to the benchmark. Good results were also reported by general practitioners who assessed the quality of their remote interfaces for telemonitoring.

AB  - With the onset of dementia primarily, but not exclusively, on elders and the lack of pharmaceutical treatment, lifestyle monitoring through technology seems to be a prominent solution. The human effort, error and cost imposed by close monitoring can be largely mitigated by promising eHealth technological solutions. Wearable, wristband or wristwatch, trackers are flooding the retail market at affordable prices. However, their acceptability and effectiveness for clinical purposes and especially the growing elderly population and their caregivers are still being investigated. This explorative study aims to answer such questions after carefully designing a questionnaire tailored to 45 end-users distributed in three groups of 15 participants each: healthcare professionals (HCP), caregivers and people with Mild Cognitive impairment (MCI) related to AD. Findings include that HCP, caregivers and MCI participants are willing to adopt eHealth solutions based on wearables in order to assist in daily care through holistic and objective monitoring as well as the difficulties, peculiarities and priorities they are aspiring to alleviate through such systems.

AB  - Congestive heart failure is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide, characterized by the inability of the heart to pump enough blood with oxygen and nutrients, leading to fluid accumulation. Monitoring fluid accumulation is crucial in managing the disease, but current noninvasive methods have limitations in terms of size and connectivity. This study introduces Volum, a wearable device that measures calf bioimpedance to remotely monitor the progression of edema in patients with congestive heart failure. The device was first tested on a known RRC circuit, demonstrating high accuracy with a maximum error of 1%. It was also tested in 2 volunteers (1 patient and 1 control) for one month. The result showed consistent impedance values in the control throughout the month, while the patient showed high variability, in addition to a lower bioimpedance value. The results suggest the potential of the device for noninvasive monitoring of bioimpedance evolution. However, more research is needed to validate the measurements in a larger patient population and to explore the potential of the device for improving patient outcomes.

AB  - A wireless acoustic wearable system was designed to directly measure wearers' heart and respiratory rates from their chest sounds and record segments concerning chest sounds. These measurements and associated recordings are provided to healthcare providers as a real-time monitor or medical log for later review. The system was validated by healthy volunteers with two gold-standard devices commonly used in healthcare settings. Both gold standard reference devices are United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared and CE-marked. Twenty-six adult volunteers between the ages of 21 and 80 were recruited. The device achieved an accuracy of ± 2.8 beats per minute (BPM) for heart rate measurement against a heart rate measurement reference of ± 3 BPM accuracy. Compared with respiratory rate measurement reference with ± 1 breath per minute (BRPM) accuracy, the devices achieved ± 0.7 BRPM accuracy. Furthermore, the usability survey result of 17 healthcare professionals and 28 lay users showed that both healthcare professionals (HCPs) and lay users could operate the system without guidance. 88% of the HCPs regarded the system to be helpful as a tool for remote patient monitoring, and 94% of the lay users agreed that the system was easy to use.

AB  - With the widespread adoption of wearable devices in our daily lives, the demand and appeal for remote patient monitoring have significantly increased. Most research in this field has concentrated on collecting sensor data, visualizing it, and analyzing it to detect anomalies in specific diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and depression. However, this domain has a notable gap in the aspect of human-machine interaction. This paper proposes REMONI, an autonomous REmote health MONItoring system that integrates multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the Internet of Things (loT), and wearable devices. The system automatically and continuously collects vital signs, accelerometer data from a special wearable (such as a smartwatch), and visual data in patient video clips collected from cameras. This data is processed by an anomaly detection module, which includes a fall detection model and algorithms to identify and alert caregivers of the patient's emergency conditions. A distinctive feature of our proposed system is the natural lan-guage processing component, developed with MLLMs capable of detecting and recognizing a patient's activity and emotion while responding to healthcare worker's inquiries. Additionally, prompt engineering is employed to integrate all patient information seamlessly. As a result, doctors and nurses can access real-time vital signs and the patient's current state and mood by interacting with an intelligent agent through a user-friendly web application. Our experiments demonstrate that our system is implementable and scalable for real-life scenarios, potentially reducing the workload of medical professionals and healthcare costs. A full-fledged prototype illustrating the functionalities of the system has been developed and being tested to demonstrate the robustness of its various capabilities.

AB  - In this paper we present a device for multiple biosignal measurement and extraction for neuromarketing. The primary objective of neuromarketing is extraction of useful information from the neurophysiological reaction of test participants for use in brand user experience, customer experience or advertising marketing material effectiveness and more. This methodology utilizes focus groups to evaluate participants' neurophysiological reactions to various stimuli and to draw statistically significant conclusions from the results. There is a problem with using multiple different sensors that they need to be synchronized separately and tuned one at a time. With the device we present, we can directly measure and utilize real-time bio-signals, such as electroencephalography (EEG), galvanic skin response (GSR), and pulse. This relatively affordable and mobile hardware allows us to analyze the recorded biometric data in real-time. By examining the statistical patterns in these signals and extracting meaningful characteristics based on aggregate data, rather than focusing on individual variations, we can categorize and utilize the recorded brain activity and other physiological measurements for a range of practical purposes.

AB  - The constant monitoring of glucose levels is crucial for the effective management of diabetes and related conditions. With the advent of advanced technologies, glucose level monitoring systems have evolved to provide accurate and convenient solutions for individuals living with diabetes. The paper presents a comprehensive review of the various technologies and applications employed in glucose level monitoring systems. The earlier method provides an overview of the conventional methods for glucose monitoring, such as fingerstick blood glucose meters. While widely used, these methods have limitations in terms of invasiveness, discomfort, and the inability to capture continuous glucose data. To address these limitations, the proposed method discusses the emergence of non-invasive and minimally invasive techniques. system. The paper explores the integration of glucose level monitoring systems with the Blynk app to monitor the data remotely using smartphone applications and wearable devices which may incorporate the glucose and Heart Rate (HR) sensors and an OLED display for user interface. The benefits of integrations, such as enhanced user experience, remote monitoring, and data accessibility, are highlighted. The proposed wearable devices have paved the way for more accurate, convenient, and personalized glucose monitoring solutions, ultimately empowering individuals with diabetes to manage their condition effectively and lead healthier lives.

AB  - Non-contact technologies are gaining much interest as promising systems for remote monitoring of physiological parameters (e.g., heart rate -HR-, respiratory rate, blood pressure, blood oxygen saturation) without interfering with the subject's comfort. Among the existing technologies, digital cameras integrated into smartphones or laptops are widely used due to their ease of use, availability, and portability. In this study, we investigated the influence of distance on the HR estimation from a video recorded with a smartphone's frontal camera. HR values were provided from a spectral analysis every 1 s. We evaluated the performances of six different algorithms to identify the best one for HR estimation simulating an occupational scenario at two distances (i.e., 0.5 m and 1 m). Data were recorded from 8 healthy volunteers of both sexes; a wearable device was used to record medical-grade ECG to estimate reference HR values. Results show that the higher the camera distance, the higher the mean absolute error (MAE): the average MAE was 1.49 bpm at 0.5 m and 2.59 bpm at 1.0 m. Moreover, Green Channel, Chrominance-based signal processing method (CHROM), and Plane Orthogonal to Skin (POS) have been identified as the best algorithms to estimate HR since they showed a better agreement with the reference system than the other algorithms.

AB  - Parkinson’s disease is a degenerative neurological disorder that impairs motor functions and is accompanied by a wide range of non-motor symptoms, such as sleep problems. Parkinsonism is assessed during clinical evaluations and via self-administered diaries and, based on these, the required medication therapies are provided to lessen symptoms. Tri-axial accelerometers and gyroscopes have the potential utility to objectively assess the patient’s condition and aid clinicians in their decision-making. People with Parkinson’s often have significant abnormalities in blood pressure due to comorbid age-related cardiovascular disease and orthostatic hypotension, which result in blurred vision, dizziness, and falls. Frequent blood pressure monitoring may aid in the evaluation of such events and differentiate Parkinson’s disease symptoms from those originated by hypotension. In the present paper, a novel technology for the remote monitoring of Parkinsonian symptoms is presented: the WESAA system. It consists of two devices, worn on the wrist and ankle; its main function is to record accelerations and angular velocities from these body parts, together with photoplethysmograph and electrocardiogram data. This information can be elaborated offline to measure common Parkinson’s disease motor symptoms (e.g., tremor, bradykinesia, and dyskinesia), as well as gait speed, sleep-wake cycles, and cuff-less blood pressure measurements. The overall system requirements, market overview, industrial design and ergonomics, system development, user experience, early results of the gathered inertial raw data, and validation of the photoplethysmograph and electrocardiogram signal waveforms are all thoroughly discussed. The developed technology satisfies all system requirements, and the sensors adopted provided outcomes comparable with gold standard techniques.

AB  - Currently, the demand for community health monitoring is increasing, and traditional monitoring equipment can no longer meet the requirements of remote monitoring. This article studied an intelligent health monitoring device (IHMD) in a wireless community remote medical monitoring system (RMMS) based on ZigBee network. Based on the inherent characteristics of community monitoring networks, this paper explored a CZR (Congestion Control ZigBee Routing) algorithm suitable for community monitoring networks through the study of ZigBee routing algorithm. In the hardware design of the system, the gateway module monitors and manages the entire community monitoring network, integrates and processes the received physiological data, and finally uploads it to the Internet. The main function of this module is to transmit physiological data through the ZigBee network protocol and TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) protocol, serving as a bridge. This article evaluated the user effectiveness of the device by collecting evaluations and feedback from community residents on the device. User ID 001 had a first-time usage experience, with a usability score of 4, reliability score of 5, and comfort score of 4. The establishment of a community health monitoring system in this article is an effective method that is conducive to promoting nationwide health monitoring.

AB  - The surge in popularity of wireless headphones, particularly wireless earbuds, as smart wearables, has been notable in recent years. These devices, empowered by artificial intelligence (AI), are broadening their utility in areas such as speech recognition, augmented reality, pose recognition, and health care monitoring, thereby enriching user experiences through novel interactive interfaces driven by embedded sensors. However, the widespread adoption of wireless earbuds has spurred concerns regarding security and privacy, necessitating robust bespoke security measures. Despite the miniaturization of mobile chips enabling the integration of sophisticated algorithms into smart wearables, the research and industrial communities have yet to accord adequate attention to earbud security. This article focuses on empowering wireless earbuds to authenticate their legitimate users, tackling the challenges associated with conventional authentication methods. Instead of relying on input interface authentication methods like PIN or lock patterns, this research delves into leveraging inertial measurement unit (IMU) data collected during interactions with devices to extract novel biometric features, presenting an alternative approach that nonetheless confronts challenges related to signal capture and interference. Consequently, we propose and design BudsAuth, an implicit user authentication framework that harnesses built-in IMU sensors in smart earbuds to capture vibration signals induced by on-face touching interactions with the earbuds. These vibrations are utilized to deliver continuous and implicit user authentication with high precision and compatibility across various earbud models. Extensive evaluation demonstrates BudsAuth’s capability to achieve an equal error rate (EER) of 0.0003, representing an approximate 99.97% accuracy with seven consecutive samples of interactive gestures for implicit authentication.

AB  - About 1% of newborns have congenital heart disease at birth. This generally does not imply death, but it leads to multiple hospitalizations and outpatient visits. In addition, it results in a negative impact on quality of life for the children themselves and for their families. Telemedicine platforms can be employed in this field, to reduce the number of hospital admissions and check-ups and to improve the communication between parents/caregivers and the hospital staff. The aim of the AIR CARDIO project is to evaluate the impact, efficiency and effectiveness of a home telemonitoring system for children with congenital heart disease. The vital signs (i.e. ECG, heart rate, body temperature, body weight and oxygen saturation) are collected by some biomedical sensors and sent to a smart-hub. The smart-hub proceeds then to the synchronization with the e-Health care center, enabling the doctors to evaluate the patient’s parameters. Some questionnaires are also provided to parents/caregivers through the application, for the evaluation of the effects of the system on quality of life. In the clinical trial, which lasts 12 months, 45 patients are recruited from the U.O.C. Paediatric and Adult Congenital Cardiology - Monasterio Foundation. Preliminary results highlight suitability of the sensors selected for children and good usability of the smart-hub technology.

AB  - One of the India's largest issues is providing healthcare to rural people; in rural areas, where more than 70% of the population resides and few medical facilities, disease-related mortality rates are at an all-time high. This research aims to suggest a medicine dispatcher box with temperature, heart rate, and pressure sensors as a component of a comprehensive system for rural real-time health management. The suggested system intends to lessen rural populations' challenges accessing healthcare services by offering a holistic solution that blends health monitoring and medication dispensing functions. The system design consists of a wearable patient device, a medicine dispatcher box, which administers medication based on the received health data, and a gateway device that processes and communicates the data to a cloud-based platform. The proposed system will be usable in rural areas with minimal resources because it is made to be user-friendly and economical. The viability and effectiveness of the suggested system are assessed through a series of experiments. The results demonstrate that the suggested approach can potentially enhance healthcare outcomes and accessibility in remote locations.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) has reshaped our lives by being part of a wide range of fields. Thus, using IoT in healthcare became highly demanded. This could be done through monitoring some of the vital health signs that provide information about the state of health. These vital signs include blood pressure, blood oxygen saturation, body temperature, and pulse rate. Besides, recognizing physical movements of the body leads to the detection of various hazards, such as falls and concussions. Being directed towards daily health monitoring, the design requirements for such device are portability, lightweight and ease of use. We can break down the process of constructing the system into four main stages: data acquisition, pre-processing the sensor readings using an embedded microprocessor, feature extraction and implementation in further recognition algorithms using a shared cloud platform, and data visualization of all vital signs in addition to callouts in case of emergency.

AB  - Effective healthcare monitoring and tracking solutions for senior individuals are urgently needed given the growing geriatric population and rising healthcare expenses. In order to provide a complete healthcare monitoring and tracking wristband for senior people, this research study suggests a wristwatch system using ESP-32 and Arduino N ano microcontrollers. Heart rate monitoring, fall detection, sleepwalk detection, GPS tracking, medication reminders, temperature monitoring, and an emergency SOS button are just a few of the functionalities that the wristband incorporates from a variety of sensors. Caretakers may check on the old person's health from a distance thanks to the technology, which transmits real-time health information to a specialized smartphone app. The technology sends notifications to surrounding caretakers in the event of crises or unstable health metrics. The suggested wristband has the potential to improve older people's quality of life by encouraging preventative care and allowing them to safely age in place. To solve usability and privacy issues, however, more development and user testing are essential. The results of the research indicate that this cutting-edge wristwatch technology has the potential to greatly enhance healthcare outcomes for the senior population.

The sensor can discriminate between speech and cough patterns, thereby expanding its applications to COVID-19 detection, speech rehabilitation training, and human/machine interactions. A combination of different sensor data is essential to acquire clinically significant information. Therefore, a sensor array is interfaced with the LoRa communication protocol to establish an Internet of Things (IoT)-based electronic textile framework. The IoT integration allows remote monitoring of body kinematics and physiological parameters. Therefore, the proposed IoT-based framework holds the potential to provide real-time and continuous health monitoring to allow immediate intervention during this pandemic.

AB  - The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has opened new frontiers in healthcare technology, enabling the development of intelligent and user-centric telehealth systems. This paper presents a smart telehealth system that seamlessly integrates LLMs across two primary modules: Appointment Scheduling and Teleconsultation. Adhering to the principles of user-centered design (UCD), the proposed system aims to enhance the overall telehealth experience for both patients and healthcare providers. The Appointment Scheduling Module leverages natural language processing and intelligent scheduling algorithms to streamline appointment booking and optimize resource utilization. The Teleconsultation Module harnesses LLMs for accurate symptom interpretation, clinical decision support, and personalized care delivery during remote consultations. The Clinical Decision Support Module integrates LLMs with medical knowledge bases and evidence-based guidelines, providing health care providers with real-time, tailored recommendations for diagnosis and treatment planning. Finally, the Health Data Analytics Module employs LLMs to analyze aggregated health data, uncover population health trends, and generate comprehensive reports to drive informed decision-making and advance medical research. By seamlessly integrating LLMs throughout the telehealth workflow, this system aims to improve accessibility, effectiveness, and user satisfaction with remote health care services, ultimately paving the way for more personalized, data-driven, and collaborative healthcare delivery models.

AB  - Continuous healthcare monitoring is a prevalent need for the spinal cord injured (SCI) population to mitigate the risk of secondary health conditions and develop preventive methods. In this paper, we developed an embodied system for remote monitoring and classification of activities of daily living (ADL). We propose a framework for sensor transfer learning to recognize these activities from simple and short samples through label transferring from a deep SlowFast network on video data. Multiple wearable devices were included and synchronized in this study to capture physiological data as well as posture and movement from acceleration and pressure distribution. Furthermore, we propose a pipeline of data capturing for automatically creating a ground truth dataset of different ADLs. Results from a pilot training with eight users in 15 minutes task recordings over eight different tasks produced a weighted accuracy on F1-score of 77% in correctly classifying ADLs. Although extending the data is required to increase precision, we showed a successful method for monitoring and classification of specific activities in SCI with up to 91% in accuracy. Further work will focus on extending to multi-class soft labelling for achieving usability in complex situations.

AB  - This article presents a continuous home telemonitoring system for chronic respiratory patients using 5G connectivity developed in partnership with Vodafone as a part of the 5G Trial in Milan established by the Italian Ministry of Economic Development. The system features a wearable respiratory and activity monitor, an environmental sensor and a pulse oximeter sending the data through a 5G router to a Multi-Edge Computing server, incorporated in the Vodafone 5G infrastructure, where they are stored and accessible for visualization. In particular, activity, respiratory and environmental data are continuously streamed and collected. The solution has been tested on 18 healthy volunteers during non-supervised recordings lasting at least 48 hours. The combination of recognized activities and associated respiratory parameters provided statistically significant variations in breathing patterns between one activity and the other, thus giving more complete information to the clinicians than previously studied telemedicine systems based on spot-checks. In particular, statistically significant differences are found in tidal volume and minute ventilation between horizontal and vertical postures (p < 0.001) and between vertical postures and dynamic activities (p < 0.001); the respiratory rate shows statistically significant differences between horizontal and vertical postures (p < 0.001). Some environmental parameters have different mean values between day and night, such as carbon dioxide (p < 0.001). Trials on patients are needed to further study this telemedicine solution and make it commercially available in the future. The main further technical development suggested is the use of commercial 5G smartphones as routers, in order to make the system usable outside of home settings.

The data collected because of advances in sensor technology and the machine learning algorithms enable the work in the field of recognition of human activities to progress. Life quality of especially elderly people highly benefits from the activity monitoring and recognition research. This study aims to collect data from multiple activities and train multiple machine learning algorithms using the recorded data. For this purpose, a total of two wireless sensors were placed on the ankle and calf regions of the subjects on one leg, and the data obtained from these sensors were used in decision tree, artificial neural network, and deep learning algorithms. The performance of the algorithms was evaluated with the F1 score metric. The results show that the most suitable algorithm for this dataset is the deep learning algorithm with an average F1 score of 0.989.

AB  - This article describes the design, development and implementation of a set of microservices based on an architecture that enables detection and assisted clinical diagnosis within the field of infectious diseases of elderly patients, via a telemonitoring system. The proposed system is designed to continuously update a medical database fed with vital signs from biosensor kits applied by nurses to elderly people on a daily basis. The database is hosted in the cloud and is managed by a flexible microservices software architecture. The computational paradigms of the edge and the cloud were used in the implementation of a hybrid cloud architecture in order to support versatile high-performance applications under the microservices pattern for the pre-diagnosis of infectious diseases in elderly patients. The results of an analysis of the usability of the equipment, the performance of the architecture and the service concept show that the proposed e-health system is feasible and innovative. The system components are also selected to give a cost-effective implementation for people living in disadvantaged areas. The proposed e-health system is also suitable for distributed computing, big data and NoSQL structures, thus allowing the immediate application of machine learning and AI algorithms to discover knowledge patterns from the overall population.

AB  - This article aimed to develop a mobile application for the management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We analyzed the pilot version with satisfaction through a survey and an interview with health workers from Sidi Said, a local hospital located in Meknès, Morocco, which receives patients suffering from COVID-19. Methods: We have formed a team effort that involves health professionals, specialists from various fields and who participated in the design process of this project. It is a review of the existing literature and interviews with health professionals seeking to trace all the functions of this application. The user interface graphics, whether at the hospital or patient application level, were reviewed for effective usability by a multidisciplinary team. After having had to develop the pilot version of the application, the usefulness and the gratitude of the application were evaluated by eight patients and carers by means of a utility test, based on a real scenario, a utility survey. The objective is to ensure communication between the mobile application and the decision support application at the emergency services level to facilitate the detection of people who had developed COVID-19 as well as follow-up at home for detected patients. Results: The COVID-19 mobile management application provides capture functions and can afford information that helps in the prescription of appropriate drugs to patients at home. It is used to identify people who have been in contact with people who have tested positive for COVID-19, to carry out a large-scale screening by sending alert messages to these people, and to follow up via geolocation. There is also the possibility via Bluetooth, for the monitoring of patients without the activation of the Geolocation option. The approach adopted aims to reduce congestion in hospitals by identifying people suffering from respiratory illnesses or who may be contaminated, and monitoring them remotely. We offered six functions to achieve the objective of this project. Main: Respiratory crisis journal, medication recall, appointment, survey of people contacted, personal equipment and dashboard, daily traceability and monitoring, and geolocation. We have integrated the application of the electronic healthcare registration system in hospitals. To simplify usability, the frequently used functions, which are relatively important, can be found on the main page under the heading “COVID-19 monitoring” (in French: COVID-19 monitoring), and “Medication log” (in French: Journal medication). In addition, during graphic design, art therapy was used to improve the psychological stability of the patient. Eight participants were employed for the evaluation. For scenario-based tasks, out of ten tasks, all participants can record the entries in detail. The system use scale score was 94 points, indicating that the system was satisfactory for the patients and the staff who tested and manipulated it. Conclusion: This article confirmed that patients were satisfied with the follow-up at home and with the caregivers of the hospital. In addition, this made it possible to accurately record their symptoms and, therefore, facilitated an early detection of COVID-19. This was very useful for analyzing crisis trends, responding to a broader detection, avoiding contamination within the same family and provide effective support for COVID-19 positive patients at home. Through integration with the electronic health record, patient health care information can be used by health care decision-makers to manage treatment plans and support medical interventions. Currently, all patients who have been followed remotely are cured. We intend to generalize this concept for the monitoring of other diseases than COVID-19 later.

AB  - Objective: Autonomic Dysreflexia (AD) is a potentially life-threatening syndrome which occurs in individuals with higher level spinal cord injuries (SCI). AD is caused by triggers which can lead to rapid escalation of pathophysiological responses and if the trigger is not removed, AD can be fatal. There is currently no objective, non-invasive and accurate monitoring system available to automatically detect the onset of AD symptoms in real time in a non-clinical setting. Technology or Method: We developed a user-independent method of symptomatic AD detection in real time with a wearable physiological telemetry system (PTS) and a machine learning model using data from eleven participants with SCI. Results: The PTS could detect onset of AD symptoms with an average accuracy of 94.10% and a false negative rate of 4.89%. Conclusions: The PTS can detect the onset of the symptoms AD with high sensitivity and specificity to assist people with SCIs in preventing the occurrence of AD. It would enable persons with high level SCIs to be more independent and pursue vocational activities while granting continuous medical oversight. Clinical Impact: The PTS could serve as a supplementary tool to current solutions to detect the onset of AD and prepare individuals who are newly injured to be better prepared for AD episodes. Moreover, it could be translated into a system to encourage individuals to practice better healthcare management to prevent future occurrences.

AB  - This research study proposes the development of comprehensive vital sign surveillance designed for real-time patient assessment. The system integrates multiple sensors, including the LM35 temperature sensor, Heartbeat Rate (HBR) and Blood Oxygen (SpO2) Sensor, DHT11 humidity and temperature sensor, OLED display, and gyroscope sensor, to provide a holistic approach to vital signs. The LM35 sensor is employed for accurate temperature measurement, providing crucial data for monitoring the patient's thermal status. This information is essential for detecting fever or abnormal temperature variations, aiding in the early identification of potential health issues. The HBR and SpO2 sensor plays a vital role in cardiovascular vital signs. The system can assess the patient's cardiac and respiratory well-being by measuring the heart rate and blood oxygen levels. Abnormalities in these parameters can trigger timely alerts, enabling swift medical intervention. The DHT11 sensor enhances the system's capabilities by monitoring ambient temperature and humidity. This additional environmental data contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the patient's surroundings, ensuring that external factors are considered in the health assessment process. Integrating an OLED display serves as an intuitive user interface, providing real-time feedback on the measured parameters. This ensures that patients and healthcare providers can easily interpret and respond to the health data presented by the system. The display can showcase temperature, humidity, heart rate, blood oxygen levels, and other relevant information in a user-friendly format. Furthermore, the gyroscope sensor adds a layer of sophistication to vital sign surveillance by enabling the assessment of body movement and posture. This feature is particularly beneficial for patients with mobility issues or those prone to falls. The gyroscope data can be analyzed to detect sudden movements or abnormal postures, triggering alerts to caregivers or healthcare professionals. The system is designed for user convenience, ensuring ease of use and portability. Wireless connectivity options can be incorporated, allowing data to be transmitted to a centralized monitoring platform or a mobile application. This enables remote monitoring, facilitating timely interventions and improving patient outcomes. The proposed vital sign surveillance has the potential to revolutionize personalized healthcare by providing continuous, non-intrusive monitoring in real time. The multi-sensor integration allows for a more nuanced and comprehensive assessment of the patient's health status, enabling early detection of potential issues and facilitating proactive healthcare interventions.

AB  - Over the years, the healthcare industry has transformed from being hospital-centric to patient-centric. This shift is mainly due to the convergence of emergent technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT)-based healthcare, fifth generation (5G)-assisted networking, and data-driven analytics through artificial intelligence. The convergence, referred to as Healthcare 5.0, has improved healthcare services to support real-time analytics, user mobility, remote monitoring, and personalized user experience through decentralized applications. However, the medical supply chain systems and delivery operations among healthcare stakeholders suffer from limitations of harsh environmental conditions due to restricted zones, rough terrains, war-prone areas, poor road conditions, congested traffic, and remote locations. Thus, the Internet of Drones (IoD) is deployed in Healthcare 5.0 supply chains to streamline and expedite the medical delivery process through open channels (i.e. the Internet). However, the Internet is an open channel that is prone to malicious activities which can violate the privacy and confidentiality of patient data. Blockchain is a promising technology that can handle the security and reliability of drone delivery among untrusted open channels. Motivated by the aforementioned facts, we propose GaRuDa, a blockchain-based drone delivery scheme for Healthcare 5.0 applications. The proposed scheme integrates IoD and blockchain through 5G-enabled tactile Internet to facilitate low-latency responsive delivery of medical supplies that can be chronologically monitored and tracked among different stakeholders. We compared the proposed scheme with the traditional medical delivery scheme with payment gateways to demonstrate its effectiveness in terms of data storage, computation, and communication costs. The simulation results obtained show that the average transaction cost has been reduced by ≈ 44.56 percent, and 5G tactile Internet has a reduced latency of 0.051 ms compared to 18.3 ms in 4G LTE service. The average communication overheads have reduced by ≈ 67.34 percent compared to traditional 4G LTE and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing channels, which indicates the scheme's viability.

AB  - Objective: Sleep monitoring has extensively utilized electroencephalogram (EEG) data collected from the scalp, yielding very large data repositories and well-trained analysis models. Yet, this wealth of data is lacking for emerging, less intrusive modalities, such as ear-EEG.Methods and procedures: The current study seeks to harness the abundance of open-source scalp EEG datasets by applying models pre-trained on data, either directly or with minimal fine-tuning; this is achieved in the context of effective sleep analysis from ear-EEG data that was recorded using a single in-ear electrode, referenced to the ipsilateral mastoid, and developed in-house as described in our previous work. Unlike previous studies, our research uniquely focuses on an older cohort (17 subjects aged 65-83, mean age 71.8 years, some with health conditions), and employs LightGBM for transfer learning, diverging from previous deep learning approaches. Results: Results show that the initial accuracy of the pre-trained model on ear-EEG was 70.1%, but fine-tuning the model with ear-EEG data improved its classification accuracy to 73.7%. The fine-tuned model exhibited a statistically significant improvement (p < 0.05, dependent t-test) for 10 out of the 13 participants, as reflected by an enhanced average Cohen’s kappa score (a statistical measure of inter-rater agreement for categorical items) of 0.639, indicating a stronger agreement between automated and expert classifications of sleep stages. Comparative SHAP value analysis revealed a shift in feature importance for the N3 sleep stage, underscoring the effectiveness of the fine-tuning process.Conclusion: Our findings underscore the potential of fine-tuning pre-trained scalp EEG models on ear-EEG data to enhance classification accuracy, particularly within an older population and using feature-based methods for transfer learning. This approach presents a promising avenue for ear-EEG analysis in sleep studies, offering new insights into the applicability of transfer learning across different populations and computational techniques.Clinical impact: An enhanced ear-EEG method could be pivotal in remote monitoring settings, allowing for continuous, non-invasive sleep quality assessment in elderly patients with conditions like dementia or sleep apnea.

AB  - The fight against pandemics is redesigning the interaction between doctor and patients with a clear request of remote monitoring of biological parameters, reducing the proximity. At this purpose, physical and chemical sensors placed on the skin with wireless reading, can provide the early detection of psycho-physical diseases. A plug&play epidermal patch based on Radiofrequency Identification technology is here proposed for the simultaneous remote reading of multi-physical and -chemical parameters of the skin. The board is designed to improve the usability of the device and to ease the experimentation of different disposable sensors. The resulting prototype made of biocompatible and comfortable encapsulation is readable up to 2 m in battery-assisted mode and up to 80 cm without embedded power source (passive mode). Sensing experimentation was preliminary performed on the bench through the triple measurement of two chemical sensors (pH and sodium concentration) together with temperature, under controlled conditions.
