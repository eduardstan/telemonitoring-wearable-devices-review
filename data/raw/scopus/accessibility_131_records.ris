AB  - Smart health kits are innovative devices that can monitor various health-related parameters in real time. Inadequate healthcare facilities in rural areas, people have limited access to quality healthcare services, leading to increased morbidity and mortality rates. Lack of patient monitoring makes it challenging to identify and treat illnesses in their early stages since remote patients frequently do not receive routine checkups and monitoring. The enormous cost of healthcare is a significant burden for many individuals, particularly those living in poverty. Inefficient healthcare delivery in the traditional healthcare system is often bogged down by bureaucracy and inefficiency, leading to long wait times, incorrect diagnoses, and ineffective treatments. Real-time healthcare monitoring is necessary to deliver effective treatment. Real-time patient data, such as vital signs, medical history, and other pertinent information, must be available to healthcare practitioners. The goal of the smart healthcare kit using an embedded system is to address the health problems of persons while driving vehicles. The embedded medical sensors such as temperature, heart rate, and alcohol gas sensors collect and transmit patient data to healthcare providers in real time enabling them to make informed decisions about patient care. This kit may be mounted to the steering wheel of any vehicle, making it simple to use and accessible for anyone while driving. The temperature sensor keeps track of the driver's body temperature and alerts the driver if it rises above a certain threshold. The heart rate sensor monitors the heart rate and notifies the user when it changes unexpectedly. Similarly, an alcohol gas sensor measures the alcohol concentration in the driver's exhaled breath to determine whether they have consumed alcohol. Thus, the smart health kit is an effective tool that can detect serious health hazards, ensure motorists are healthy while operating vehicles, and prevent accidents caused by medical conditions or alcohol consumption; this greatly increases the safety of individuals, particularly those who drive professionally. The availability of real-time health monitoring and notifications enables people to take preventative action to maintain their health and stay safe. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Wearable sensors in healthcare monitoring have recently found widespread applications in biomedical fields for their non- or minimal-invasive, user-friendly and easy-accessible features. Sensing materials is one of the major challenges to achieve these superiorities of wearable sensors for healthcare monitoring, while graphene-based materials with many favorable properties have shown great efficiency in sensing various biochemical and biophysical signals. In this paper, we review state-of-the-art advances in the development and modification of graphene-based materials (i.e., graphene, graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide) for fabricating advanced wearable sensors with 1D (fibers), 2D (films) and 3D (foams/aerogels/hydrogels) macroscopic structures. We summarize the structural design guidelines, sensing mechanisms, applications and evolution of the graphene-based materials as wearable sensors for healthcare monitoring of biophysical signals (e.g., mechanical, thermal and electrophysiological signals) and biochemical signals from various body fluids and exhaled gases. Finally, existing challenges and future prospects are presented in this area. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of the study is to assess the experiences, barriers, and expectations regarding current patient monitoring systems among intensive care unit nurses at one university hospital. Methods: A qualitative exploratory study approach was adopted to test the research questions. Results: Intensive care unit personnel placed a high value on practical criteria such as user friendliness and visualization while assessing the present monitoring system. Poor alarm handling was recognized as possible patient safety hazards. The necessity of high accessibility was highlighted once again for a prospective system; wireless, noninvasive, and interoperability of monitoring devices were requested; and smart phones for distant patient monitoring and alert management improvement were required. Conclusion: Core comments from ICU personnel are included in this qualitative research on patient monitoring. All national healthcare involved parties must focus more on user-derived insights to ensure a speedy and effective introduction of digital health technologies in the ICU. The findings from the alarm control or mobile device studies might be utilized to train ICU personnel to use new technology, minimize alarm fatigue, increase medical device accessibility, and develop interoperability standards in critical care practice. 2024 Rayan, Al-Ghabeesh, Fawaz, Behar and Toumi.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) development made it possible for technology to communicate physical education by connecting cost-effective heterogeneous devices and digital applications to uncontrolled and accessible environments. The traditional physical education monitoring environment creates crucial manual efforts on athletes' activity observations and tracking consistently. Similarly, remote monitoring and assessment of athletes in sports training seem to be barriers to physical education monitoring and training. It creates various chances to improve training and education through technology advancements like IoT and deep learning. Students can efficiently monitor their physical behavior to increase their physical and psychological benefits. The IoT-assisted physical activity monitoring device is proposed to track students' physical activity and enhance outcomes. The management ability allows students to organize and increase speed their physical activity in a wellness manner. In addition, this study examines the connections between monitoring ability which is an essential component for sports activities and physical activity. This system collects essential information from IoT-based wearable devices that interact with the data in real time by virtualizing the device. The IoT network includes several device activities and monitors the heartbeat and physical body temperature of a person. The analysis of specific studies and student feedback shows that the designed virtual system of physical educations is effective in its application and implementation and provides a reliable guide for developing student physical educational systems. The experimental analysis is evaluated; the solution offered is developing and supporting physical education and training approaches in reality and creates healthy environment systems to solve the health monitoring challenges posed by IoT devices. The proposed method has achieved extraordinary physical activity monitoring compared to the conventional systems, as shown by experimental findings. The simulation analysis of physical education can help students and improve the associated aspects of physical abilities with high accuracy ratio (98.3), prediction ratio (96.5%), interaction ratio (94.4%), performance ratio (95.1%), the efficiency ratio (93.2), F-score (92.2%), and reduce error rate (17.5%) and physical activity patterns. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - With technological advances in wearable health care monitoring system, there increasing demands for the patterning technology for reliable sensors. Dry-film photoresists (DFRs) have several advantages for the patterning of silver nanowires (AgNWs), including cost-effectiveness, low toxicity of the process, and ease of mass production through a roll-to-roll process. In this study, using DFRs, we achieved the facile fabrication of AgNW-based chips for optical detection of myoglobin (Mb) via surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). Mb is found in accessible biological fluids such as urine and serum, which is a representative protein biomarker for human health monitoring. AgNWs were successfully patterned on polyethylene terephthalate films using DFR to form multiple spots, with a diameter of ~500 µm, that are available for detection. SERS spectra showed that the AgNW chips can efficiently detect myoglobin proteins down to levels of clinical significance. Our results will provide insights for the cost-effective production method of futuristic health care monitoring system. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Patients with impaired mobility and neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, dementia etc. are vulnerable to bed falls, which can be damaging to their physical and psychological well-being. Existing systems are mostly fall detection based on wearable devices, which can be uncomfortable to wear or ambient devices such as cameras that invade privacy. A bed falls prediction system using force sensitive resistors (FSR) has been proposed in this paper. It is designed to eliminate privacy intrusion and discomfort issues. The system can identify the patient's different on-bed positions and determine the possibility of bed falls. In case of any risky position, the caretaker will be alerted to mobile applications via the Internet of Things (IoT), making patient monitoring more accessible and manageable. This integrated system yields an average of 92% accuracy for 5 different on-bed positions. The bed fall prediction system will facilitate caretakers/nurses to take care conveniently at homes, hospitals and assisted care facilities to ensure patients' health and safety.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Mobile health (mHealth) has recently had significant advances in tele-dermatology (TD) thanks to the developments following the COVID-19 pandemic. This topic is very important, as telemedicine and mHealth, when applied to dermatology, could improve both the quality of healthcare for citizens and the workflow in the health domain. The proposed study was centered on the last three years. We conducted an overview on the opportunities, the perspectives, and the problems involved in TD integration with mHealth. The methodology of the narrative review was based on: (I) a search of PubMed and Scopus and (II) an eligibility assessment, using properly proposed parameters. The outcome of the study showed that during the COVID-19 pandemic, TD integration with mHealth advanced rapidly. This integration enabled the monitoring of dermatological problems and facilitated remote specialist visits, reducing face-to-face interactions. AI and mobile apps have empowered citizens to take an active role in their healthcare. This differs from other imaging sectors where information exchange is limited to professionals. The opportunities for TD in mHealth include improving service quality, streamlining healthcare processes, reducing costs, and providing more accessible care. It can be applied to various conditions, such as (but not limited to) acne, vitiligo, psoriasis, and skin cancers. Integration with AI and augmented reality (AR), as well as the use of wearable sensors, are anticipated as future developments. However, integrating TD with mHealth also brings about problems and challenges related to regulations, ethics, cybersecurity, data privacy, and device management. Scholars and policymakers need to address these issues while involving citizens in the process. © 2023 by the author.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) is considered a serious public health problem due to the uncertainty of its onset. Consuming wearable devices have increasing popularities for healthcare monitoring, and many of them are capable of continuous monitoring and early detection of CVDs. This paper proposes a framework for heart sound detection that can be considered for deployment on smart wearable devices to screen CVDs conveniently. A dual-stream convolutional neural network (DS-CNN) is developed to detect abnormal ones from short-term heart sound recordings. Preprocessing module is first employed for noise filtering and amplitude normalization. Then short-time Fourier transform and higher-order spectral are introduced for feature extraction, whose products are subsequently fed into the DS-CNN for screening abnormal heart sound signals. Two open accessible datasets are employed for performance evaluation. The results well demonstrate the classification accuracy of the proposed DS-CNN, and also indicate its advantages for adapting to heart sound recordings collected by different equipments.  © 1975-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Bioethanol is believed to be an influential revolutionary gift of biotechnology, owing to its elevating global demand and massive production. Pakistan is home to a rich diversity of halophytic flora, convertible into bounteous volumes of bioethanol. On the other hand, the accessibility to the cellulosic part of biomass is a major bottleneck in the successful application of biorefinery processes. The most common pre-treatment procedures existent include physicochemical and chemical approaches, which are not environmentally benign. To overcome these problems, biological pre-treatment has gained importance but the drawback is the low yield of the extracted monosaccharides. The current research was aimed at exploring the best pre-treatment method for the bioconversion of halophyte Atriplex crassifolia into saccharides using three thermostable cellulases. Atriplex crassifolia was subjected to acid, alkali and microwave pre-treatments, followed by compositional analysis of the pre-treated substrates. Maximum delignification i.e. 56.6% was observed in the substrate pre-treated using 3% HCl. Enzymatic saccharification using thermostable cellulases also validated the results where the highest saccharification yield i.e. 39.5% was observed for the sample pre-treated using same. Maximum enzymatic hydrolysis of 52.7% was obtained for 0.40 g of the pre-treated halophyte Atriplex crassifolia where Endo-1,4- (Formula presented.) -glucanase (300U), Exo-1,4- (Formula presented.) -glucanase (400U) and (Formula presented.) -1,4-glucosidase (1000U) were simultaneously added and incubated for 6 h at 75°C. The reducing sugar slurry obtained after optimization of saccharification was utilized as glucose in submerged fermentation for bioethanol production. The fermentation medium was inoculated with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, incubated at 30°C and 180 rpm for 96 h. Ethanol production was estimated using potassium dichromate method. Maximum production of bioethanol i.e. 16.33% was noted at 72 h. It can be concluded from the study that Atriplex crassifolia owing to its high cellulosic content after pre-treatment using dilute acid method, yields substantial amount of reducing sugars and high saccharification rates when subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis using thermostable cellulases, under optimized reaction conditions. Hence, the halophyte Atriplex crassifolia is a beneficial substrate that can be utilized to extract fermentable saccharides for bioethanol production.

AB  - The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has caused unmatched harm and death to elderly people worldwide. As a result, many countries around the world are or have been on lockdown, and most patients testing positive or suspected as being positive for COVID-19 are placed in self-isolation in a hospital or home self-isolation to reduce the spread of infection. Several nations recognized for their effective healthcare systems are experiencing a shortage of intensive-care mechanical respirators, healthcare professionals, protective equipment, and bed spaces in quarantine hospitals. There are unmeasurable health challenges that have taken an immense toll within the elderly population globally. In particular, elderly people have to face various types of health, financial, physical, and mental struggles due to COVID-19. This pandemic has created pressure and anxiety on healthcare sectors, and this called for the need of remote patient monitoring. Internet of Medical Things (IoMT)-based smart healthcare is having an increased impact in dealing with COVID-19 in this era of innovative digital expertise. The popularity of wearable devices enables a new perspective for the prevention of the spread of infectious diseases. Wearable devices is a solution that provides an effective option for the omnipresent, reliable, and accessible tracking of aged patients in remote environments, and in real-time. Hence, wearable and implantable body area network instruments are very useful for the constant tracking of the aged person during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, this chapter explains the important role of cloud-IoMT-based wearable wireless sensor networks in medicine to reduce the burden on caregivers and to help the aged to live an active life during the pandemic. Also, an architecture is proposed of an intelligent cloud-IoMT-based elderly healthcare monitoring scheme using a wearable body sensor network. The proposed method advises and alerts medical personnel in real time about a change to the health conditions of elderly patients during the COVID-19 pandemic to suggest preventive measures in saving lives. The cloud-IoMT-based system can accommodate any number of wearable sensor devices and a huge number of applications. The platform also enables remote health monitoring, real-time monitoring, contact tracking, and prompt analysis of a COVID-19 outbreak, thus reducing the workload of medical personnel for the control and prevention of an outbreak. The cloud-IoMT-based system is a quick and rapid way of tracking, monitoring, and diagnosing elderly patients that helps to prevent the spreading of the infection to others. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In this study, we developed a novel solar-powered wearable miniaturized human sweat tracker that specifically monitors key metabolic analytes (pH, glucose, and cortisol levels) and body temperature. Its wearability and self-monitoring platform allow users to track their physical and mental status. Our fully integrated system in smartwatch construction offers an accessible avenue for quantitative analysis. Furthermore, the laser printing electrode method reduces the cost of fabrication, eliminates the complexity of multiple target biomarkers screening, and enables large-scale production. It can also contribute to revolutionizing self-powered wireless sensor networks for other biomedical devices. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Mobile health technologies present a new approach for continuous patient monitoring in free-living environments and promise major improvements in the management and early identification of musculoskeletal disease. These advances are driven by a plethora of research dedicated to wearables-based biomechanical analysis enabling characterization of clinically relevant variables that previously required laboratory technology. Remote patient monitoring presents several advantages to the in-lab alternative in terms of observation frequency, accessibility, and ecological validity of patient evaluations. However, the extent to which these developments have translated for remotely monitoring patients with musculoskeletal conditions is unclear. This is addressed in the current review and, specifically, the characterization of human movement in terms of cumulative physical activity (e.g., step count) as an assessment distinct from stride-by-stride analysis (e.g., daily average stride frequency). EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The PubMed database was searched for relevant articles using terms related to the use of wearable sensors for remote monitoring of gait in patients with musculoskeletal conditions. References in each identified article were searched for additional studies to include. All outcome variables were categorized as either a measure of cumulative physical activity or as pertaining to a stride-by-stride level analysis. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Of the 90 studies identified, 87 quantified cumulative physical activity compared to only ten that characterized movement on a stride-by-stride level. CONCLUSIONS: Indices of cumulative physical activity are the most common metric for remotely monitoring patients with musculoskeletal conditions. Remote biomechanical analysis at a stride-by-stride level is relatively under-utilized considering the vast increase in research devoted to wearables-based algorithm development. © 2021 EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA

AB  - There is a massive transformation in the traditional healthcare system from the specialist-centric approach to the patient-centric approach by adopting modern and intelligent healthcare solutions to build a smart healthcare system. It permits patients to directly share their medical data with the specialist for remote diagnosis without any human intervention. Furthermore, the remote monitoring of patients utilizing wearable sensors, Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, and artificial intelligence (AI) has made the treatment readily accessible and affordable. However, the advancement also brings several security and privacy concerns that poorly maneuvered the effective performance of the smart healthcare system. An attacker can exploit the IoT infrastructure, perform an adversarial attack on AI models, and proliferate resource starvation attacks in smart healthcare system. To overcome the aforementioned issues, in this survey, we extensively reviewed and created a comprehensive taxonomy of various smart healthcare technologies such as wearable devices, digital healthcare, and body area networks (BANs), along with their security aspects and solutions for the smart healthcare system. Moreover, we propose an AI-based architecture with the 6G network interface to secure the data exchange between patients and medical practitioners. We have examined our proposed architecture with the case study based on the COVID-19 pandemic by adopting unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for data exchange. The performance of the proposed architecture is evaluated using various machine learning (ML) classification algorithms such as random forest (RF), naive Bayes (NB), logistic regression (LR), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and perceptron. The RF classification algorithm outperforms the conventional algorithms in terms of accuracy, i.e., 98%. Finally, we present open issues and research challenges associated with smart healthcare technologies.  © 2022 Sachi Chaudhary et al.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic and discovery of new mutant strains have a devastating impact worldwide. Patients with severe COVID-19 require various equipment, such as ventilators, infusion pumps, and patient monitors, and a dedicated medical team to operate and monitor the equipment in isolated intensive care units (ICUs). Medical staff must wear personal protective equipment to reduce the risk of infection. This study proposes a tele-monitoring system for isolation ICUs to assist in the monitoring of COVID-19 patients. The tele-monitoring system consists of three parts: medical-device panel image processing, transmission, and tele-monitoring. This system can monitor the ventilator screen with obstacles, receive and store data, and provide real-time monitoring and data analysis. The proposed tele-monitoring system is compared with previous studies, and the image combination algorithm for reconstruction is evaluated using structural similarity index (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). The system achieves an SSIM score of 0.948 in the left side and a PSNR of 23.414 dB in the right side with no obstacles. It also reduces blind spots, with an SSIM score of 0.901 and a PSNR score of 18.13 dB. The proposed tele-monitoring system is compatible with both wired and wireless communication, making it accessible in various situations. It uses camera and performs live data monitoring, and the two monitoring systems complement each other. The system also includes a comprehensive database and an analysis tool, allowing medical staff to collect and analyze data on ventilator use, providing them a quick, at-a-glance view of the patient's condition. With the implementation of this system, patient outcomes may be improved and the burden on medical professionals may be reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic-like situations. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - Breast cancer is a serious health concern that affects millions of women worldwide. Early detection is crucial for effective management and increasing the chances of survival. However, traditional methods of breast cancer detection can be time-consuming, expensive, and inaccessible to many women. In recent years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as a promising solution for healthcare providers to monitor and manage patients remotely. By leveraging IoT devices such as wearables and sensors, healthcare providers can collect data on patients' health and track changes over time. This paper explores the use of IoT in breast cancer detection and management. Breast Cancer Detection System using IoT presented in this work that combines wearable devices and sensors to monitor changes in breast tissue and collect data on a patient's health. The collected data is analysed using machine learning algorithms to identify potential abnormalities and provide early warning signs of breast cancer. The system is designed to be affordable and accessible, making it particularly suitable for use in low-income or rural areas where traditional methods of breast cancer detection may not be available. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Background: Physical disabilities become more common with advancing age. Rehabilitation restores function, maintaining independence for longer. However, the poor availability and accessibility of rehabilitation limits its clinical impact. Artificial Intelligence (AI) guided interventions have improved many domains of healthcare, but whether rehabilitation can benefit from AI remains unclear. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of AI-supported physical rehabilitation technology tested in the clinical setting to understand: 1) availability of AI-supported physical rehabilitation technology; 2) its clinical effect; 3) and the barriers and facilitators to implementation. We searched in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Science Citation Index (Web of Science), CIRRIE (now NARIC), and OpenGrey. Results: We identified 9054 articles and included 28 projects. AI solutions spanned five categories: App-based systems, robotic devices that replace function, robotic devices that restore function, gaming systems and wearables. We identified five randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which evaluated outcomes relating to physical function, activity, pain, and health-related quality of life. The clinical effects were inconsistent. Implementation barriers included technology literacy, reliability, and user fatigue. Enablers included greater access to rehabilitation programmes, remote monitoring of progress, reduction in manpower requirements and lower cost. Conclusion: Application of AI in physical rehabilitation is a growing field, but clinical effects have yet to be studied rigorously. Developers must strive to conduct robust clinical evaluations in the real-world setting and appraise post implementation experiences. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - The convergence of Internet-based technology with primary care utility is critical for the worldwide amalgamation of quality medical management and its accessibility. Innovation has remained a significant aspect of medical care, allowing physicians to employ a variety of instruments to examine, administer, and observe patients. This paper’s central emphasis is on e-health data collection, conveyance, and surveillance apparatus. The wireless monitoring system monitors patients’ medical metrics and communicates them to the furthest edge via the ZigBee gateway. This paper introduces an IoT-enabled smart e-healthcare system that can continuously monitor patients' vital signs and the real-time room environment where patients are currently positioned. This system collects data from the hospital premises using five sensors: the body temperature sensor, the heartbeat sensor, the room temperature sensor, the CO2 sensor, and the CO sensor. For each situation, the percentage of errors in the developed scheme is less than 2%. The patient's situation is relayed to medical personnel via a portal, where they can monitor, process, and analyze the patient's real-time situation. A low-power communication device and an embedded smart IoT system are being designed and developed with the goal of covertly gathering physiological metrics without interfering with daily life. Sensor-based data analytics using machine learning methods were used in this study to identify predictors and/or sudden abnormality indicators accurately. The data for heart rate and body temperature is analyzed using the bio-medical sensors embedded with an ARM Cortex-A7 microcontroller. For the benchmark accuracy of the dataset, a detailed calculation of experiments in the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) with various machine learning techniques is compared. It has been exemplified through extensive testing that the recommended procedure outperforms machine learning methodologies with a 15% increase in accuracy, facilitating rapid alarms to prevent the aftereffects of abnormalities if they occur, which the system without the utilized methodology lags. Cloud storage allows for the analysis of parameters regarding patients. The error between observed and actual data is analyzed to validate the proposed Internet of Medical Things model. The performance of the proposed method is further identified by using various classifications, like decision trees, discriminant analysis, support vector machines, and Naive Bayes, for detecting any variation from normal data or disorder on real-time datasets. © 2023 Seventh Sense Research Group®

AB  - This paper outlines the development of a wearable device to measure knee joint flexion angles and compares its performance to a computer vision based human pose model. The objective is to advance techniques used in measuring joint flexion angles, which have several drawbacks such as relying heavily on the clinician for accuracy while also being invasive as they require physical contact between the patient and orthopaedic specialist. The proposed implementations integrate digital innovation in orthopaedic healthcare while being affordable and easy to deploy, making them marketable to clinicians and patients in developing countries. To evaluate the workability of the implementations, knee flexion angle measurements of a test subject were obtained using both techniques which yielded consistent and comparable flexion angle readings. Further development of this work can have a significant impact on the accessibility and affordability of innovative healthcare monitoring technologies, especially for patients in developing countries.  © 2023 IST-Africa Institute.

AB  - Background: Successful post-knee replacement rehabilitation requires adequate access to health information, social support, and periodic monitoring by a health professional. Mobile health (mHealth) and computer-based technologies are used for rehabilitation and remote monitoring. The extent of technology use and its function in post-knee replacement rehabilitation care in low and middle-income settings are unknown. Objective: To inform future mHealth intervention development, we conducted a scoping review to map the features and functionality of existing technologies and determine users’ perspectives on telerehabilitation and technology for self-management. Methods: We followed the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for scoping reviews. We searched the Embase, Medline, PsycINFO via OVID, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases for manuscripts published from 2001 onward. We included original research articles reporting the use of mobile or computer-based technologies by patients, health care providers, researchers, or family members. Studies were divided into the following 3 categories based on the purpose: validation studies, clinical evaluation, and end user feedback. We extracted general information on study design, technology features, proposed function, and perspectives of health care providers and patients. The protocol for this review is accessible in the Open Science Framework. Results: Of the 5960 articles, 158 that reported from high-income settings contributed to the qualitative summary (64 studies on mHealth or telerehabilitation programs, 28 validation studies, 38 studies describing users’ perceptions). The highest numbers of studies were from Europe or the United Kingdom and North America regarding the use of a mobile app with or without wearables and reported mainly in the last decade. No studies were from low and middle-income settings. The primary functions of technology for remote rehabilitation were education to aid recovery and enable regular, appropriate exercises; monitoring progress of pain (n=19), activity (n=20), and exercise adherence (n=30); 1 or 2-way communication with health care professionals to facilitate the continuum of care (n=51); and goal setting (n=23). Assessment of range of motion (n=16) and gait analysis (n=10) were the commonly validated technologies developed to incorporate into a future rehabilitation program. Few studies (n=14) reported end user involvement during the development stage. We summarized the reasons for satisfaction and dissatisfaction among users across various technologies. Conclusions: Several existing mobile and computer-based technologies facilitate post-knee replacement rehabilitation care for patients and health care providers. However, they are limited to high-income settings and may not be extrapolated to low-income settings. A systematic needs assessment of patients undergoing knee replacement and health care providers involved in rehabilitation, involving end users at all stages of development and evaluation, with clear reporting of the development and clinical evaluation can make post-knee replacement rehabilitation care in resource-poor settings accessible and cost-effective. © 2024 Sabhya Pritwani.

AB  - Breast cancer related lymphedema (BCRL) is a common, debilitating condition that can affect up to one in five breast cancer surviving patients (BCSP). BCRL can significantly reduce the quality of life (QOL) of patients and poses a significant challenge to healthcare providers. Early detection and continuous monitoring of lymphedema is crucial for the development of client-centered treatment plans for post-cancer surgery patients. Therefore, this comprehensive scoping review aimed to investigate the current technology methods used for the remote monitoring of BCRL and their potential to facilitate telehealth in the treatment of lymphedema. Initially, five electronic databases were systematically searched and analyzed following the PRISMA flow diagram. Studies were included, specifically if they provided data on the effectiveness of the intervention and were designed for the remote monitoring of BCRL. A total of 25 included studies reported 18 technological solutions to remotely monitor BCRL with significant methodological variation. Additionally, the technologies were categorized by method of detection and wearability. The findings of this comprehensive scoping review indicate that state-of-the-art commercial technologies were found to be more appropriate for clinical use than home monitoring, with portable 3D imaging tools being popular (SD 53.40) and accurate (correlation > 0.9, p < 0.05) for evaluating lymphedema in both clinic and home settings with expert practitioners and therapists. However, wearable technologies showed the most future potential for accessible and clinical long-term lymphedema management with positive telehealth outcomes. In conclusion, the absence of a viable telehealth device highlights the need for urgent research to develop a wearable device that can effectively track BCRL and facilitate remote monitoring, ultimately improving the quality of life for patients following post-cancer treatment.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Background: Mental health conditions have become a substantial cause of disability worldwide, resulting in economic burden and strain on the public health system. Incorporating cognitive and physiological biomarkers using noninvasive sensors combined with self-reported questionnaires can provide a more accurate characterization of the individual’s well-being. Biomarkers such as heart rate variability or those extracted from the electrodermal activity signal are commonly considered as indices of autonomic nervous system functioning, providing objective indicators of stress response. A model combining a set of these biomarkers can constitute a comprehensive tool to remotely assess mental well-being and distress. Objective: This study aims to design and validate a remote multiparametric tool, including physiological and cognitive variables, to objectively assess mental well-being and distress. Methods: This ongoing observational study pursues to enroll 60 young participants (aged 18-34 years) in 3 groups, including participants with high mental well-being, participants with mild to moderate psychological distress, and participants diagnosed with depression or anxiety disorder. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are being evaluated through a web-based questionnaire, and for those with a mental health condition, the criteria are identified by psychologists. The assessment consists of collecting mental health self-reported measures and physiological data during a baseline state, the Stroop Color and Word Test as a stress-inducing stage, and a final recovery period. Several variables related to heart rate variability, pulse arrival time, breathing, electrodermal activity, and peripheral temperature are collected using medical and wearable devices. A second assessment is carried out after 1 month. The assessment tool will be developed using self-reported questionnaires assessing well-being (short version of Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7), and depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) as the reference. We will perform correlation and principal component analysis to reduce the number of variables, followed by the calculation of multiple regression models. Test-retest reliability, known-group validity, and predictive validity will be assessed. Results: Participant recruitment is being carried out on a university campus and in mental health services. Recruitment commenced in October 2022 and is expected to be completed by June 2024. As of July 2023, we have recruited 41 participants. Most participants correspond to the group with mild to moderate psychological distress (n=20, 49%), followed by the high mental well-being group (n=13, 32%) and those diagnosed with a mental health condition (n=8, 20%). Data preprocessing is currently ongoing, and publication of the first results is expected by September 2024. Conclusions: This study will establish an initial framework for a comprehensive mental health assessment tool, taking measurements from sophisticated devices, with the goal of progressing toward a remotely accessible and objectively measured approach that maintains an acceptable level of accuracy in clinical practice and epidemiological studies. © 2024 JMIR Publications Inc..

AB  - Background: Wireless vital parameter continuous monitoring (WVPCM) after discharge is compared to regular monitoring to provide data on the clinical-economic impact of complex patients (CPs) discharged from Internal Medicine Units of Ospedale dei Castelli, Lazio. Primary outcome: Major complications (MC) reduction. Secondary outcomes: Patients who reached discharge criteria within the 7th day from admission; difference in MC incidence at the conclusion of the standard telemonitoring/clinical monitoring phase, 5 and 30 days after discharge; and conditions predisposing to MC occurrence. Methods: Open label randomized controlled trial with wearable wireless system that creates alerts on portable devices. Continuous glycemic monitoring is performed for patients with diabetes mellitus. Results: There were 110 patients enrolled (mean age: 76.2 years). Comorbidity: Cumulative Illness Rating Scale CIRS-CI (comorbidities index): 3.93, CIRS SI (severity index): 1.93. About 19% scored a BRASS (Blaylock Risk Assessment Screening Score) ≥20 indicating need for discharge planning requiring step-down care. Globally, 48% of patients in the control group had major complications (27 out of 56 patients), in contrast to 22% in the intervention group (12 out of 54 patients). Conclusions: Since WVPCM detects early complications during the post-discharge CPs monitoring, it increases safety and reduces inappropriate access to the Emergency Room, preventing avoidable re-hospitalizations. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Telemedicine and remote patient monitoring (RPM) systems have been gaining interest and received adaptation in healthcare sectors since the COVID-19 pandemic due to their efficiency and capability to deliver timely healthcare services while containing COVID-19 transmission. These systems were developed using the latest technology in wireless sensors, medical devices, cloud computing, mobile computing, telecommunications, and machine learning technologies. In this article, a real-time remote patient monitoring system is proposed with an accessible, compact, accurate, and low-cost design. The implemented system is designed to an end-to-end communication interface between medical practitioners and patients. The objective of this study is to provide remote healthcare services to patients who need ongoing care or those who have been discharged from the hospital without affecting their daily routines. The developed monitoring system was then evaluated on 1177 records from MIMIC-III clinical dataset (aged between 19 and 99 years). The performance analysis of the proposed system achieved 88.7% accuracy in generating alerts with logistic regression classification algorithm. This result reflects positively on the quality and robustness of the proposed study. Since the processing time of the proposed system is less than 2 minutes, it can be stated that the system has a high computational speed and is convenient to use in real-time monitoring. Furthermore, the proposed system will fulfil to cover the lower doctor-to-patient ratio by monitoring patients from remote locations and aged people who reside in their residences. © 2023 Htet Yamin Ko Ko et al.

AB  - Aim: To understand parental awareness and appetite for virtual health modalities, including asynchronous communication and remote monitoring. To understand which socio-demographic characteristics are associated with greater awareness and appetite for virtual health. Methods: Nationally representative survey of Australian parents, recruited via an online panel in February 2021 as part of the Royal Children's Hospital National Child Health Poll. Participants were randomly selected from the consumer panel. Results: 1981 (59.4% response rate) parents completed the survey. 39.9% were aware of virtual health care, defined by digital technology and medical devices to support remote monitoring. Higher levels of awareness were associated with being male, having previous teleconsultation experience, higher education attainment and employment. Most parents reported an appetite for asynchronous communication using an app or website to either provide information prior to a consult (65.9%), provide a photo of a rash or similar (61.7%) or receive medical advice (58.1%). Appetite for wearable devices was similar at 59.9%. Conclusions: Whilst awareness of virtual healthcare was low, appetite exists amongst Australian parents to use technology to support their child's health care. Health-care models, which incorporate asynchronous communication or symptom monitoring through apps, are likely to be acceptable and offer an accessible and sustainable alternative to traditional face-to-face health care. © 2022 Paediatrics and Child Health Division (The Royal Australasian College of Physicians).

AB  - Objective: Intermittent claudication (IC) can severely limit functional capacity and quality of life. Supervised exercise therapy is the recommended first line management; however, this is often limited by accessibility, compliance and cost. As such, there has been an increased interest in the use of wearable activity monitors (WAMs) in home based telemonitoring exercise programmes for claudicants. This review aims to evaluate the efficacy of WAM as a feedback and monitoring tool in home based exercise programmes for patients with IC. Data Sources: A search strategy was devised. The databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched through to April 2020. Review Methods: Randomised trials and prospective trials were included. Eligible trials had to incorporate WAMs as a feedback tool to target walking/exercise behaviour. The primary outcome was the change in walking ability. Study quality was assessed with risk of bias tool. Results: A total of 1148 records were retrieved. Of these, eight randomised controlled trials and one prospective cohort study, all of which compared a WAM intervention against standard care and/or supervised exercise, met the inclusion criteria. Owing to heterogeneity between studies, no meta-analysis was conducted. WAM interventions improved measures of walking ability (heterogeneous outcomes such as maximum walking distance, claudication distance and six minute walk distance), increased daily walking activity (steps/day), cardiovascular metrics (maximum oxygen consumption), and quality of life. Conclusion: There is some evidence that home based WAM interventions are beneficial for improving walking ability and quality of life in patients with IC. However, existing studies are limited by inadequate sample size, duration, and appropriate power. Achieving consensus on outcome reporting and study methods, as well as maximising device adherence, is needed. © 2020 European Society for Vascular Surgery

AB  - In the pursuit of advancing healthcare technologies and promoting the well-being of the elderly population, this paper presents a conceptual framework for early detection of gait disorders through public IoT-based health monitoring. As global life expectancy continues to rise, there is an increasing need for unobtrusive health monitoring systems that can facilitate the early identification of health issues, particularly among the elderly. While many healthcare monitoring technologies exist, their limited accessibility and deployment in controlled environments or healthcare facilities present challenges. To address this, our innovative concept proposes a smart IoT-based outdoor health monitoring system, specifically designed for public spaces such as parks and supermarkets. This system aims to collect data on mobility, posture, and gait, recognising the crucial role that gait plays in an individual's well-being. The proposed system leverages the power of the Internet of Things (IoT) to gather data seamlessly from individuals in their everyday environments, creating a more holistic and real-world understanding of their health. By analysing gait patterns and deviations, our conceptual framework aims to serve as an early warning system for health-care providers, caregivers, and individuals themselves, alerting them to potential health concerns and enabling proactive intervention. This concept, while in its early stages, holds immense promise for addressing the challenges of an ageing population and reducing healthcare disparities. It aligns with the broader vision of harnessing emerging technologies to enhance the quality of life for the elderly.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - The healthcare system that depends on the Internet of Things (IoT) assists individuals and aids their vital everyday life activities. The affordability and user-friendliness of the usage of IoT start revolutionizing healthcare services. The IoT and its related technologies have emerged as the most preferred use cases in the healthcare system. Hence, the security and privacy issues associated with smart healthcare systems and their participated entities make its general acceptance still a dream. Also, as a remote patient monitoring system using IoT-based devices are the increase in privacy, popularity, accessibility, security concerns of logging and the transfer of medical data continue arising. Therefore, this chapter proposes IoT-based blockchain-protected medical data utilizing a smart contract for secure analysis and management of wearable sensors based on the Ethereum protocol. The integration of blockchain will counter the security and privacy issues that may arise using IoT-based wearable devices in the healthcare monitoring system, thus facilitating safe and secure storage of patients’ information in the utilization of IoT devices in the healthcare system. IoT-based healthcare can be employed to enhance the well-being of patients, make the healthcare system more effective, and help respond quickly to emergencies. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - This article presents a continuous home telemonitoring system for chronic respiratory patients using 5G connectivity developed in partnership with Vodafone as a part of the 5G Trial in Milan established by the Italian Ministry of Economic Development. The system features a wearable respiratory and activity monitor, an environmental sensor and a pulse oximeter sending the data through a 5G router to a Multi-Edge Computing server, incorporated in the Vodafone 5G infrastructure, where they are stored and accessible for visualization. In particular, activity, respiratory and environmental data are continuously streamed and collected. The solution has been tested on 18 healthy volunteers during non-supervised recordings lasting at least 48 hours. The combination of recognized activities and associated respiratory parameters provided statistically significant variations in breathing patterns between one activity and the other, thus giving more complete information to the clinicians than previously studied telemedicine systems based on spot-checks. In particular, statistically significant differences are found in tidal volume and minute ventilation between horizontal and vertical postures (p < 0.001) and between vertical postures and dynamic activities (p < 0.001); the respiratory rate shows statistically significant differences between horizontal and vertical postures (p < 0.001). Some environmental parameters have different mean values between day and night, such as carbon dioxide (p < 0.001). Trials on patients are needed to further study this telemedicine solution and make it commercially available in the future. The main further technical development suggested is the use of commercial 5G smartphones as routers, in order to make the system usable outside of home settings.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Over the past two decades, there has been a notable and swift advancement in the field of healthcare with regards to the Internet of Things (IoT). This progress has brought forth a substantial prospect for healthcare services to enhance performance, transparency, and cost effectiveness. Internet of Things gateways, such as local computational facilities, mobile devices, or custom miniature computational embedded electronics like the Raspberry Pi (RPi), are crucial in facilitating the required processing and data compression tasks as well as serving as front-end event detectors. Numerous home-based healthcare monitoring systems are currently accessible; however, they have several limitations. This paper examines the role of the Raspberry Pi gateway in the healthcare system, specifically in the context of pre-operative prehabilitation programs (PoPPs). The IoT remote monitoring system employed a Microduino integrated with various supporting boards as a wearable device. Additionally, a Raspberry Pi was utilised as a base station or mobile gateway, while ThingSpeak served as the cloud platform. The monitoring system was developed with the purpose of assisting healthcare personnel in real time, remotely monitoring patients while engaging in one or more of the nine typical physical activities that are often prescribed to individuals participating in a prehabilitation program. Furthermore, an alert notification system was designed to notify the clinician and patient if the values were abnormal (i.e., the patient had not been active for many days). The integration of IOT and Raspberry Pi technology into a pre-operative prehabilitation program yielded a promising outcome with a success rate of 78%. Consequently, this intervention is expected to facilitate the resolution of challenges encountered by healthcare providers and patients, including extended waiting periods and constraints related to staffing and infrastructure. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - In recent decades, telemedicine has revolutionized the healthcare landscape, offering innovative solutions to improve the accessibility and efficiency of medical care. In this context, the Internet of Things (IoT) has played a significant role, facilitating connectivity and data exchange between medical devices and healthcare providers. However, while traditional IoT primarily focuses on local connectivity, the evolution towards the Internet of Remote Medical Things (IoRMT) has opened new frontiers in telemedicine, enabling the monitoring and treatment of patients even in remote or hard-to-reach areas. IoRMT represents an integrated approach that leverages advanced communication and sensing technologies to enable the connection and interaction of remote medical devices with healthcare networks. This interconnected infrastructure allows healthcare professionals to monitor patients in real-time, diagnose medical conditions, and provide personalized care, regardless of their geographical location. Through the adoption of wearable sensors, remote monitoring devices, and teleassistance systems, IoRMT offers a wide range of applications in telemedicine. One of the key areas where IoRMT has demonstrated its potential is in the management of chronic diseases. Patients suffering from conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, or heart disease can benefit from regular monitoring and real-time feedback from their healthcare providers, enabling more effective and proactive management of their health conditions. Additionally, IoRMT facilitates the delivery of specialized care in remote areas where access to healthcare services is limited. However, the implementation of IoRMT in telemedicine presents significant challenges, including data security, patient privacy, and the quality of network connections in remote areas. It is crucial to address these challenges through the implementation of advanced security protocols, compliance with data privacy regulations, and optimization of communication infrastructures. In conclusion, the Internet of Remote Medical Things represents a significant evolution in telemedicine, offering innovative solutions to improve the accessibility, efficiency, and quality of remote medical care. Through the integration of advanced technologies and clinical practices, IoRMT has the potential to radically transform the way healthcare is delivered and received worldwide, contributing to the improvement of health and well-being in global communities. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - The classification of simple and complex sequences of operations is made easier according to the use of heterogeneous sensors from a wearable device. Sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) is being used in smartphone platforms for elderly healthcare monitoring, fall detection, and inappropriate behavior prevention, such as smoking habit, unhealthy eating, and lack of exercise. Common machine learning and deep learning techniques have recently been presented to tackle the HAR issue, with a focus on everyday activities, particularly general human activities including moving, sitting, and standing. However, there is an intriguing and challenging HAR research subjects involving more complicated psychological activities in various environments, including smoking, eating, and drinking. The use of heterogeneous sensor data to enhance recognition performance over sensor-based deep learning networks is considered in this work. We demonstrate that using a combination of two inertial measurement units outperforms employing either an accelerometer or a gyroscope by utilizing four deep learning classifiers to recognize complex human activity (CHA). Furthermore, we describe the impact of five window sizes (5s - 40s) on a publicly accessible benchmark dataset and how increasing window size effects to the classification performance of CHA deep learning networks.  © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Recently, the healthcare industry has undergone rapid transformation from the traditional hospital-based scheme to a patient-centered approach. Patients are demanding newer, more personalized, and accessible healthcare services matching the speed of modern life. Remote monitoring, teleconsultation, telesurgery, robotics for assisted living, to mention a few, are examples of new medical services that are becoming widespread thanks to the advancements in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) such as IoT wearables, cloud computing, reliable wireless networks, etc. However, these services produce massive amounts of data and need very strict QoS requirements related to latency, energy efficiency, data rates, mobility, positioning accuracy, security, privacy, etc. For the latency and energy efficiency requirements, Edge/Fog computing combined with AI/ML approaches are the answer to compensate the limitations of the cloud. For high data rates, mobility management, and positioning accuracy, the 5G mobile standard offer promising features to tackle the different use cases' needs. Security and privacy measures can be implemented in all the above-mentioned technologies. In this article, we review and describe the most relevant use cases in the healthcare industry. We identify the technical and QoS requirements of each use case. Then we survey recent works about the enabling technologies. Finally, we identify the challenges and open issues in the existing literature. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Conventional medical diagnosis is centered on complex blood sampling and analysis, which is time-consuming and involves multiple pretreatment processes. In contrast, fast-growing wearable biosensors offer continuous monitoring of health and physiological status of individuals in a real-time and noninvasive fashion. Recent advances in electrochemical sensors enable rapid, sensitive, and selective detection of trace levels of vital bioindicators from complex biofluids. Wearable sensors harvest biochemical information from easily accessible biofluids such as sweat, saliva, tears, and interstitial fluid. Conformal integration of wearable sensors onto the skin surface or fabric substrate is essential for facile biofluid collection and transport. Skin or fabric surfaces are nonplanar and flexible in nature, which mandates use of wearable electrodes having similar mechanical properties and self-healing abilities. Also, wearable sensors need miniature controller electronics to realize multiplexed readout of biomarker signals, data processing, wireless signal transition, and user-friendly data readout gadgets. The chapter focuses on the recent advances and challenges in the sensor development, their translational capabilities, and commercial values. © 2024 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with a fast increasing prevalence. Several pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions are available to alleviate symptoms. Technology can be used to improve the efficiency, accessibility and feasibility of these treatments. Although many technologies are available, only few are actually implemented in daily clinical practice. Aim: Here, we study the barriers and facilitators, as experienced by patients, caregivers and/or healthcare providers, to successful implement technology for PD management. Methods: We performed a systematic literature search in the PubMed and Embase databases until June 2022. Two independent raters screened the titles, abstracts and full texts on: 1) people with PD; 2) using technology for disease management; 3) qualitative research methods providing patients’, caregivers and/or healthcare providers’ perspective, and; 4) full text available in English or Dutch. Case studies, reviews and conference abstracts were excluded. Results: We found 5420 unique articles of which 34 were included in this study. Five categories were made: cueing (n = 3), exergaming (n = 3), remote monitoring using wearable sensors (n = 10), telerehabilitation (n = 8) and remote consultation (n = 10). The main barriers reported across categories were unfamiliarity with technology, high costs, technical issues and (motor) symptoms hampering the use of some technologies. Facilitators included good usability, experiencing beneficial effects and feeling safe whilst using the technology. Conclusion: Although only few articles presented a qualitative evaluation of technologies, we found some important barriers and facilitators that may help to bridge the gap between the fast developing technological world and actual implementation in day-to-day living with PD. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - Mental disorders, encompassing conditions like depression, pose a significant global health challenge. Traditional diagnostic methods, while valuable, have inherent limitations, necessitating the exploration of innovative approaches. In this study, we delved into the analysis of grapho-phonological data as potential objective indicators of depression. Our research journey began with an analysis of an existing database, containing handwriting and drawing data from both healthy individuals and those diagnosed with depressive disorders. Leveraging this data, we developed machine learning models designed to distinguish between these two groups. Notably, we observed that models utilizing drawing-related features outperformed those relying on writing features. This section of our study highlights the potential of combining these data for enhanced depression detection. The creation of a new database is a noteworthy addition, providing grapho-phonological data (i.e., handwriting, drawing and laughter data) from healthy and depressed subjects. The analysis of these data sets reached peak performance, achieving superior accuracy values in comprehensive classification models, underscoring the potential of this multi-modal approaches. The study also presents a streamlined, non-invasive protocol that allows to efficiently gather essential grapho-phonological data, taking only approximately 7 min per participant. Moreover, our work introduces the “Voice & Drawing App”, an accessible tool enabling remote data collection for mental health assessment. This innovation aligns with telemonitoring trends and offers a user-friendly solution, whether within clinical settings or patients’ homes. An accelerometer-based inertial measurement units system (IMUs) to capture motion patterns has been introduced into the app. This choice is driven by the recognition of the valuable information encoded in psychomotor behaviour, that can serve as indicators of depression. Our study highlights promising avenues for future research, including expanding subject populations, implementing automatic laughter recognition, and incorporating video data to capture facial expressions. Wearable devices with IMUs offer exciting opportunities for comprehensive depression assessment. In summary, our research seeks to improve our understanding of depression by exploring innovative approaches that incorporate graphological signals, laughter, and IMUs. These multidimensional strategies aim to enhance the accuracy of depression detection and telemonitoring, ultimately facilitating more timely and effective interventions in mental health care. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Recent developments in smart mobile devices (SMDs), wearable sensors, the Internet, mobile networks, and computing power provide new healthcare opportunities that are not restricted geographically. This paper aims to introduce Mobilemicroservices Architecture (MMA) based on a study on architectures. In MMA, an HTTP-based Mobilemicroservivce (MM) is allocated to each SMD's sensor. The key benefits are extendibility, scalability, ease of use for the patient, security, and the possibility to collect raw data without the necessity to involve cloud services. Feasibility was investigated in a two-year project, where MMA-based solutions were used to collect motor function data from patients with Parkinson's disease. First, we collected motor function data from 98 patients and healthy controls during their visit to a clinic. Second, we monitored the same subjects in real-time for three days in their everyday living environment. These MMA applications represent HTTP-based business-logic computing in which the SMDs' resources are accessible globally. © 2022 International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) and IOS Press.

AB  - In an increasingly health-aware population and a move towards remote diagnostics, remote healthcare monitoring and cloud-based med-tech, we tap on the ubiquitous and unlimited reservoir of on-skin biomarkers, including sweat metabolites, in developing a wearable, non-invasive, continuous and real-time sensor - a printed, multiplexed biosensor. Such a device can be colorimetric or electrochemical in its sensing mechanism. Our integrated devices are designed and developed with scalability and translation in mind - ensuring printability (for scalable manufacturing), ease of fabrication routes, and solid-state and miniaturised prototype. In particular, we emphasize on wearable chemo-sensors that allow for non-invasive continuous monitoring of chemical markers from our body (skin) without the presence of bodily fluid, enabling a wide range of use-cases and accessible populations. In such devices, enabling chemo-sensing without a fluidic environment [1] , and addressing the need of a stable, sensitive and selective enzyme complex for the sensor [2] , are two key challenges.  © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Postural instability is associated with disease status and fall risk in Persons with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS). However, assessments of postural instability, known as postural sway, leverage force platforms or wearable accelerometers, and are most often conducted in laboratory environments and are thus not broadly accessible. Remote measures of postural sway captured during daily life may provide a more accessible alterative, but their ability to capture disease status and fall risk has not yet been established. We explored the utility of remote measures of postural sway in a sample of 33 PwMS. Remote measures of sway differed significantly from lab-based measures, but still demonstrated moderately strong associations with patient-reported measures of balance and mobility impairment. Machine learning models for predicting fall risk trained on lab data provided an Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.79, while remote data only achieved an AUC of 0.51. Remote model performance improved to an AUC of 0.74 after a new, subject-specific k-means clustering approach was applied for identifying the remote data most appropriate for modelling. This cluster-based approach for analyzing remote data also strengthened associations with patient-reported measures, increasing their strength above those observed in the lab. This work introduces a new framework for analyzing data from remote patient monitoring technologies and demonstrates the promise of remote postural sway assessment for assessing fall risk and characterizing balance impairment in PwMS. © 2001-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Background: There is no doubt that the recent surge in artificial intelligence (AI) research will change the trajectory of next-generation health care, making it more approachable and accessible to patients. Therefore, it is critical to research patient perceptions and outcomes because this trend will allow patients to be the primary consumers of health technology and decision makers for their own health. Objective: This study aimed to review and analyze papers on AI-based consumer health informatics (CHI) for successful future patient-centered care. Methods: We searched for all peer-reviewed papers in PubMed published in English before July 2022. Research on an AI-based CHI tool or system that reports patient outcomes or perceptions was identified for the scoping review. Results: We identified 20 papers that met our inclusion criteria. The eligible studies were summarized and discussed with respect to the role of the AI-based CHI system, patient outcomes, and patient perceptions. The AI-based CHI systems identified included systems in mobile health (13/20, 65%), robotics (5/20, 25%), and telemedicine (2/20, 10%). All the systems aimed to provide patients with personalized health care. Patient outcomes and perceptions across various clinical disciplines were discussed, demonstrating the potential of an AI-based CHI system to benefit patients. Conclusions: This scoping review showed the trend in AI-based CHI systems and their impact on patient outcomes as well as patients’ perceptions of these systems. Future studies should also explore how clinicians and health care professionals perceive these consumer-based systems and integrate them into the overall workflow. ©Onur Asan, Euiji Choi,

AB  - Physical rehabilitation and exercise training have emerged as promising solutions for improving health, restoring function, and preserving quality of life in populations that face disparate health challenges related to disability. Despite the immense potential for rehabilitation and exercise to help people with disabilities live longer, healthier, and more independent lives, people with disabilities can experience physical, psychosocial, environmental, and economic barriers that limit their ability to participate in rehabilitation, exercise, and other physical activities. Together, these barriers contribute to health inequities in people with disabilities, by disproportionately limiting their ability to participate in health-promoting physical activities, relative to people without disabilities. Therefore, there is great need for research and innovation focusing on the development of strategies to expand accessibility and promote participation in rehabilitation and exercise programs for people with disabilities. Here, we discuss how cutting-edge technologies related to telecommunications, wearables, virtual and augmented reality, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing are providing new opportunities to improve accessibility in rehabilitation and exercise for people with disabilities. In addition, we highlight new frontiers in digital health technology and emerging lines of scientific research that will shape the future of precision care strategies for people with disabilities. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - This article is focused on the detection of the teeth's color for health care purposes and/or aesthetic purposes. According to World Health Organization (WHO) [1], oral diseases affect almost half of the world's population. This is a result of many factors such as the lack of dentists available in certain countries, negligence for their oral care, high cost of consulting, etc. To solve this issue, it was decided to create a new device that is low-cost, and accessible to common people without any dentary's knowledge. As a first attempt, it was created a device that is possible to detect the color of teeth for analysis and aesthetic purposes. The device consists of LED and 2 photosensors to detect the variation of light, calculating which color they belong. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Tele-rehabilitation has the potential to transform the way patients are monitored from home, overcoming geographical barriers, enhancing accessibility, and promoting patient autonomy. The development of a tele-rehabilitation system capable of automating the recognition of performed exercises may significantly impact rehabilitation outcomes. Implementation of machine learning algorithms combined with magneto-inertial measurement units (M-IMUs) has enabled remote home-based rehabilitation therapy through wearable systems. Thus, in this study sixteen healthy participants and sixteen patients with rotator cuff injuries were enrolled to perform six shoulder rehabilitation exercises while wearing a wearable system based on three M-IMUs. This study aimed to conduct a thorough analysis of the features extracted from time-series data collected by these three sensors during these exercises. The statistical analysis indicated statistically significant differences in task features, but not between participant groups. Three features, identified as the most representative and distinctive among all tasks, were subsequently, used to train the Support Vector Classifier in classifying the six exercises. The obtained classification results are promising for the application of this wearable device in remote monitoring of patients with shoulder musculoskeletal disorders during home-based rehabilitation exercises. Further studies will involve the implementation of the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), along with the training of additional machine learning models. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Globally, cardiovascular disorders, including Atrial Fibrillation (AF), are a major health issue. Telemedicine and cloud-based neural networks are used to improve heart disease diagnosis and monitoring for AF patients in this research. Our technique uses remote patient monitoring and AI to improve AF diagnosis, treatment, and management. This paper develops a cloud-integrated neural network model to interpret real-time patient electrocardiogram (ECG) data. The neural network is trained on a broad dataset to detect modest AF start or progression patterns. Scalable, accessible, and effective data management is achieved using cloud computing. Telemedicine is crucial to this framework since it allows patients to be monitored remotely. Healthcare practitioners get notifications for abnormal ECG patterns, allowing quick intervention and individualized treatment. Patient data is safely saved in the cloud for long-term analysis and population-level AF research. The suggested telemedicine method improves AF event detection accuracy, according to preliminary data. Cloud-based neural networks improve diagnostics and enable healthcare research and information exchange. The system advances cardiac disease management, emphasizing AF, using integration and technology. This research may improve patient outcomes, lower healthcare costs, and increase population-level cardiovascular health knowledge. Teleconsultations maintain patient care while protecting sensitive health data. The system's flexibility and learning increase diagnostic accuracy.  © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Wearable applications require power sources that are flexible, affordable, compact, and easily accessible. However, conventional power electronic devices are impractical due to their heaviness and rigidity. Additionally, batteries and external power sources have limited lifespans and applications, posing challenges for implanted and wearable devices that require consistent energy supplies. To overcome these challenges, 1D energy-related technologies have been developed, with nanogenerators emerging as an ideal power source. They can generate biomechanical energy from physical activities like muscle contraction and heartbeat and convert it into electrical signals for various applications, including biological indicator detection, cardiac pacing, nerve stimulation, and tissue repair. This review provides an overview of piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENGs) and recent progress in their development, with a focus on biomaterial-based PENGs for healthcare monitoring. Furthermore, the review discusses the future prospects and challenges of optimizing PENGs. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - Electrocardiograms (ECGs) provide crucial information for evaluating a patient’s cardiovascular health; however, they are not always easily accessible. Photoplethysmography (PPG), a technology commonly used in wearable devices such as smartwatches, has shown promise for constructing ECGs. Several methods have been proposed for ECG reconstruction using PPG signals, but some require signal alignment during the training phase, which is not feasible in real-life settings where ECG signals are not collected at the same time as PPG signals. To address this challenge, we introduce PPG2ECGps, an end-to-end, patient-specific deep-learning neural network utilizing the W-Net architecture. This novel approach enables direct ECG signal reconstruction from PPG signals, eliminating the need for signal alignment. Our experiments show that the proposed model achieves mean values of 0.977 mV for Pearson’s correlation coefficient, 0.037 mV for the root mean square error, and 0.010 mV for the normalized dynamic time-warped distance when comparing reconstructed ECGs to reference ECGs from a dataset of 500 records. As PPG signals are more accessible than ECG signals, our proposed model has significant potential to improve patient monitoring and diagnosis in healthcare settings via wearable devices. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Free-living assessment and remote monitoring is important for healthcare researchers. Moving research beyond the laboratory provides habitual environments for remote assessment that allows research to remain agile even when facing uncontrollable external factors e.g., the SARS-COV-2 pandemic. Emergent technologies have the potential to make this form of assessment feasible by providing accessible and affordable mechanisms for conducting free-living research. This paper presents findings from a study that was halted due to the pandemic, but this work highlighted a series of challenges that may present themselves to researchers conducting similar work. By transparently reporting the challenges and solutions rather than just methods, it is hoped that the lessons learned from this study could provide researchers with greater awareness in future studies. © 2021 ACM.

AB  - Metal elements, including noble and transition metals, have always been required in the design of electrochemical sensors. Despite great advances, some drawbacks like the release of metal ions and exfoliation of catalysts from substrates still exist. Acid oxidation treatment, as a simple and effective way, is commonly used in the surface treatment of carbon materials, extensively used either directly as capacitive and catalytic electrodes or as the current collectors. However, its potential to be directly applied for electrochemical sensing has not been explored enough. In this work, a metal-free electrochemical sensor based on a surface oxygen-functionalized carbon cloth (CC) is fabricated through a simple acid oxidation treatment, during which more oxygen-containing groups are introduced, ensuring the solvent-accessible hydrophilic surface of electrodes and the improved surface interaction with dopamine. Our results suggest that the enhanced dopamine sensing performance can be obtained just through the introduction of oxygen-containing groups. Compared with raw CC, the acid-oxidized CC (AOCC) exhibits improved electrochemical sensing performance. A high sensitivity (9320 μA mM-1 cm-2), a low detection limit (10 nM), and a wide linear range (0.1-104.5 μM) are achieved. The selectivity, stability, and reproducibility are also proved to be satisfactory. Furthermore, the flexibility of AOCC endows its promising potential in fabricating wearable and soft electronics for human healthcare monitoring.  © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Pressure sensors with high flexibility and sensitivity face significant challenges in meeting the delicate balance and synergy among suitable active sensing electrode materials, substrates, and their device geometry design. In this contribution, layer-engineered delaminated Ti-MXene (DL-Ti3C2Tx) is introduced, which has relatively wider interlayer spacing through intercalated large organic molecules and accordion-like open internal microstructure than the narrower pristine Ti3C2Tx MXene (Ti-MXene), graphene/carbon nanotube's interlayer spacing suitably fulfill the high sensitivity and flexibility requirement through accessible electronic pathways under the external pressure. Notably, a milder in-situ ambient condition etching is performed to eliminate the associated safety risks for a flexible personal healthcare monitoring pressure sensor. DL-Ti3C2Tx MXene-empowered, flexible pressure sensor demonstrates a broad range of sensitivities up to a very high-pressure of 20.8 kPa at a sensitivity of 242.3 kPa−1 with a fast response and recovery time (<300 ms). A twofold increase in pressure sensitivity performance of DL-Ti3C2Tx MXene than that of Ti-MXene, graphene can be attributed to the engineered wider interlayer distance among the delaminated DL-Ti3C2Tx MXene layers causing a facile interlayer atomic movements, contacts, and reversible compressibility. The current economical, scalable DL-Ti3C2Tx MXene flexible pressure sensor can provide future safe personal healthcare artificial intelligence with real-time tracking ability. © 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

AB  - Self-monitoring respiratory and cardiac health is challenging without proper equipment and medical knowledge. While Masimo offers ideal remote monitoring through a pulse oximeter, device accessibility is still a significant issue. Thus, we designed a novel device designed for remote monitoring of vital signs using the Internet of Things (IoT) technology and sensor technology in healthcare. Leveraging the capabilities of the modest MAX30102 sensor and ESP32 microcontroller, the device integrates seamlessly with IoT networks, enabling real-time transmission of heart and respiratory rate (RR) data with general assessment feedback to a convenient cellphone application. A sophisticated digital signal processing (DSP) algorithm was implemented in the device, which accurately derives RR from photoplethysmography (PPG) heart rate signals. This DSP-based device ensures precision in RR measurement and facilitates self-monitoring. Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Bland-Altman analysis results demonstrated the device's accuracy and reliability in capturing vital sign data. By bridging IoT capabilities with advanced DSP techniques, the device is a promising solution for remote patient monitoring to improve healthcare.  © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - The significant morbidity and death rates associated with sepsis indicate that it is still an important health care concern. Wearable technologies, cloud computing, and logistic regression predictive analytics are proposed as unique techniques to identify sepsis early on in this research. Wearable sensors continuously monitor physiological parameters, collecting real-time data and sending it to the cloud for analysis. A logistic regression model trained using prior patient data can analyze the incoming data and predict the chance of sepsis development. The cloud's scalability, adaptability, and real-time processing communicate the necessity for quick interventions. The predictive analytics method shows some encouraging accuracy in spotting the first symptoms of sepsis and alerting doctors just in time. Combining wearable technology with cloud computing enhances accessibility to crucial health data, permitting remote monitoring and proactive healthcare management. The feasibility of the suggested approach in early sepsis diagnosis has been shown via both simulated and real-world patient studies. This system could enhance patient outcomes by facilitating early interventions and individualized healthcare recommendations. The cloud-based solution's scalability and flexibility also open the door to more widespread use in predictive analytics for a wide range of medical disorders. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Since its introduction in 2014, laser-induced graphene (LIG) from commercial polymers has been gaining interests in both academic and industrial sectors. This can be clearly seen from its mass adoption in various fields ranging from energy storage and sensing platforms to biomedical applications. LIG is a 3-dimensional, nanoporous graphene structure with highly tuneable electrical, physical, and chemical properties. LIG can be easily produced by single-step laser scribing at normal room temperature and pressure using easily accessible commercial level laser machines and materials. With the increasing demand for novel wearable devices for biomedical applications, LIG on flexible substrates can readily serve as a technological platform to be further developed for biomedical applications such as point-of-care (POC) testing and wearable devices for healthcare monitoring system. This review will provide a comprehensive grounding on LIG from its inception and fabrication mechanism to the characterization of its key functional properties. The exploration of biomedicals applications in the form of wearable and point-of-care devices will then be presented. Issue of health risk from accidental exposure to LIG will be covered. Then LIG-based wearable devices will be compared to devices of different materials. Finally, we discuss the implementation of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) to wearable devices and explore and speculate on its potentials and challenges.

AB  - Hospitalized patients often are readmitted soon after discharge, with many hospitalizations being potentially preventable. The authors evaluated a mobile health intervention designed to improve post-hospitalization support for older adults with common chronic conditions. All participants enrolled with an informal caregiver or "CarePartner" (CP). Intervention patients received automated assessment and behavior change calls. CPs received automated, structured feedback following each assessment. Clinicians received alerts about serious problems identified during patient calls. Controls had a 65% greater risk of hospitalization within 90 days post discharge than intervention patients (P =.041). For every 6.8 enrollees, the intervention prevented 1 rehospitalization or emergency department encounter. The intervention improved physical functioning at 90 days (P =.012). The intervention also improved medication adherence and indicators of the quality of communication with CPs (all P <.01). Automated telephone patient monitoring and self-care advice with feedback to primary care teams and CPs reduces readmission rates over 90 days. © 2021 SAGE Publications Inc.. All rights reserved.

AB  - Architectural, cognitive, and service layers are the three components that come together to form the system as a whole. The data that is acquired by the instruments at the application layer is processed by the system that is in charge of the network. The conceptual layer, which is where edge sensors are put, is responsible for managing radio resource management and intersensor connections in order to solve the issues raised by the physical layer about increasing power consumption and increased latency. In response to the processed data provided by the logical layer, the application layer will make judgements. The key objective is to lower prices so that they are more accessible to regular people. Patients will not only be able to maintain their financial stability, but they will also have easy access to private therapy. This research presents a solution based on the Internet of Things (IoT), which will simplify the usage of a generally complicated medical device while allowing you to do it at a reasonable cost and in the comfort of your own home. The Elephant Herding Optimizations using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) method is discussed here in order to differentiate between healthy and unhealthy patterns of behavior. The scoring function, also known as fuzzy logic, is used in order to arrive at a conclusion on the severity of the irregularity. In the end, tests were carried out to see how well the recommended work fared in contrast to the existing approaches in terms of specificity, recall, f1-score, and ROC curve. These metrics were examined.  © 2023 - IOS Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ubiquitous computing has been a green research area that has managed to attract and sustain the attention of researchers for some time now. As ubiquitous computing applications, human activity recognition and localization have also been popularly worked on. These applications are used in healthcare monitoring, behavior analysis, personal safety, and entertainment. A robust model has been proposed in this article that works over IoT data extracted from smartphone and smartwatch sensors to recognize the activities performed by the user and, in the meantime, classify the location at which the human performed that particular activity. The system starts by denoising the input signal using a second-order Butterworth filter and then uses a hamming window to divide the signal into small data chunks. Multiple stacked windows are generated using three windows per stack, which, in turn, prove helpful in producing more reliable features. The stacked data are then transferred to two parallel feature extraction blocks, i.e., human activity recognition and human localization. The respective features are extracted for both modules that reinforce the system’s accuracy. A recursive feature elimination is applied to the features of both categories independently to select the most informative ones among them. After the feature selection, a genetic algorithm is used to generate ten different generations of each feature vector for data augmentation purposes, which directly impacts the system’s performance. Finally, a deep neural decision forest is trained for classifying the activity and the subject’s location while working on both of these attributes in parallel. For the evaluation and testing of the proposed system, two openly accessible benchmark datasets, the ExtraSensory dataset and the Sussex-Huawei Locomotion dataset, were used. The system outperformed the available state-of-the-art systems by recognizing human activities with an accuracy of 88.25% and classifying the location with an accuracy of 90.63% over the ExtraSensory dataset, while, for the Sussex-Huawei Locomotion dataset, the respective results were 96.00% and 90.50% accurate. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Telemedicine enables the remote provision of medical care through information and communication technologies, facilitating data transmission, patient participation, promotion of heart-healthy habits, diagnosis, early detection of acute decompensation, and monitoring and follow-up of cardiovascular diseases. Wearable devices have multiple clinical applications, ranging from arrhythmia detection to remote monitoring of chronic diseases and risk factors. Integrating these technologies safely and effectively into routine clinical practice will require a multidisciplinary approach. Technological advances and data management will increase telemonitoring strategies, which will allow greater accessibility and equity, as well as more efficient and accurate patient care. However, there are still unresolved issues, such as identifying the most appropriate technological infrastructure, integrating these data into medical records, and addressing the digital divide, which can hamper patients’ adoption of remote care. This article provides an updated overview of digital tools for a more comprehensive approach to atrial fibrillation, heart failure, risk factors, and treatment adherence. © 2023 Sociedad Española de Cardiología

AB  - Introduction: Remote monitoring (RM) of cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIED) allows rapid detection of clinical and electrical events. Recently, several smartphone applications have been developed with the aim of improving patient compliance and better interpreting and integrating data deriving from remote control for the management of heart failure (HF). Areas covered: Studies investigating the role of CIEDs’ RM in HF patients to predict and early treat acute decompensation. The importance of new technologies and applications developed to provide crucial information to clinicians, to better manage HF patients. Expert opinion: New medical technologies and smartphone applications for CIEDs’ RM were developed to help clinicians in the management of CIED carriers. Indeed, the accessibility of technological devices (e.g. smartphones) and the improvements in medical technology provide the opportunity to optimize HF patients’ monitoring by the transmission of device-related data, and with direct involvement of patients themselves. Thanks to these advancements, physicians have the possibility to recognize worsening signs of HF and promptly optimize treatments to potentially avoid hospitalization. The great value of this approach is its potential of reducing scheduled in-office visits or unnecessary medical contacts and optimizing healthcare resources management. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Featured Application: This is a thematically-structured literature review that reports on the latest medical technologies used in post-COVID-19 cardiopulmonary rehabilitation, which includes not only hospital care medical devices but also telemedicine-based rehabilitation, remote patient monitoring and emerging technologies used in cardiopulmonary rehabilitation. Randomized trials, recommendations, quasi-randomized or prospective controlled clinical trials, reports, guidelines, field updates and letters to the editor were included in English. Two independent authors selected studies that met the inclusion criteria in this review. The inclusion criteria are: the year of publication (2020–2022), the approach of technologies and techniques used in the cardiopulmonary rehabilitation process for COVID-19 sequel, the patient’s accessibility to techniques and technologies and the duration of the reduced recovery period. Exclusion criteria: studies that include pathologies other than cardiopulmonary pathologies post-COVID-19 sequels. Studies for which the complete text could not be found or which did not address the cardiopulmonary rehabilitation treatments or services of COVID-19 patients were excluded. Managing cardiopulmonary rehabilitation in patients with COVID-19 remains a global challenge due to the facets of this virus. The technologies used in the rehabilitation of post-COVID-19 patients fail to keep pace with the global epidemiological developments. The purpose of this article is to review the medical technologies used in post-COVID-19 cardiopulmonary rehabilitation and the innovations that have allowed us to adapt and care for our patients. The pandemic highlighted the need for seismic changes in diagnostic and rehabilitation paradigms. We discuss advances in telemedicine and telemedicine-based rehabilitation, remote patient monitoring and emerging technologies used in cardiopulmonary rehabilitation. The rapid adoption of modern technologies in the practice of post-COVID-19 cardiopulmonary rehabilitation is promising and can improve patients’ access to complex rehabilitation programs with outstanding results. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Shoulder pain represents the most frequently reported musculoskeletal disorder, often leading to significant functional impairment and pain, impacting quality of life. Home-based rehabilitation programs offer a more accessible and convenient solution for an effective shoulder disorder treatment, addressing logistical and financial constraints associated with traditional physiotherapy. The aim of this systematic review is to report the monitoring devices currently proposed and tested for shoulder rehabilitation in home settings. The research question was formulated using the PICO approach, and the PRISMA guidelines were applied to ensure a transparent methodology for the systematic review process. A comprehensive search of PubMed and Scopus was conducted, and the results were included from 2014 up to 2023. Three different tools (i.e., the Rob 2 version of the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool, the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal tool, and the ROBINS-I tool) were used to assess the risk of bias. Fifteen studies were included as they fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The results showed that wearable systems represent a promising solution as remote monitoring technologies, offering quantitative and clinically meaningful insights into the progress of individuals within a rehabilitation pathway. Recent trends indicate a growing use of low-cost, non-intrusive visual tracking devices, such as camera-based monitoring systems, within the domain of tele-rehabilitation. The integration of home-based monitoring devices alongside traditional rehabilitation methods is acquiring significant attention, offering broader access to high-quality care, and potentially reducing healthcare costs associated with in-person therapy. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Children and young people with asthma need regular monitoring to maintain good asthma control, prevent asthma attacks and manage comorbidities. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in healthcare professionals making fundamental changes to the way healthcare is delivered and for patients and families adapting to these changes. Comprehensive remotely delivered, technology-based healthcare, closer to the patients home (reducing hospital footfall and possibly reducing carbon footprint) is likely to be one of the important collateral effects of the pandemic. Telemedicine is anticipated to impact everyone involved in healthcare - providers and patients alike. It is going to bring changes to organization, work areas and work culture in healthcare. Healthcare providers, policymakers and those accessing healthcare services will experience the impact of technology-based healthcare delivery. Telemedicine can play an exciting role in the management of childhood asthma by delivering high-quality care closer to the child's home. However, unlike adults, children still need to be accompanied by their carers for virtual care. Policymakers will need to take into account potential additional costs as well as the legal, ethical and cultural implications of large scale use of telemedicine. In this narrative review, we review evidence regarding the role of telemedicine and related emerging technologies in paediatric and adolescent asthma. Although there are gaps in the current knowledge, there is evidence demonstrating the important role of telemedicine in management of childhood and adolescent asthma. However, there is an urgent need for healthcare researchers and policymakers to focus on improving the technologies and address the disparities in accessing novel technology-based management strategies to improve asthma care. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Currently, a big issue is people's inability to gain entry to health monitoring systems. Internet of Things (IoT) based solutions to remotely track a patient's vitals are abundant in the fight against this issue. In this article, an IoT based health monitoring system that can track the patient's core body temperature and heart rate remotely for remote or fatally infected areas, has been developed. With this device, doctors may get accurate readings on the patient's vitals every 10 seconds. This system will collect that data from the patient's body and transmit it to an IoT cloud platform. This will make the information accessible from anywhere with an internet connection. The patient's condition can be tracked in real time, where it can be accessed by the treating physician or other authorized personnel. For remote camping, power efficient solar-battery system also initialized to empower low power medical equipment with vaccine storage to ensure remote health facilities. The system performance was evaluated and presented with field implementation.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Introduction: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an increasingly prevalent chronic, autoimmune, and inflammatory central nervous system illness, whose common symptoms undermine the quality of life of patients and their families. Recent technical breakthroughs potentially offer continuous, reliable, sensitive, and objective remote monitoring solutions for healthcare. Wearables can be useful for evaluating falls, fatigue, sedentary behavior, exercise, and sleep quality in people with MS (PwMS). Objective: This scoping review of relevant literature explores studies investigating the perceptions of patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs) about the use of wearable technologies in the management of MS. Methods: The Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for scoping reviews was used. The search strategy was applied to the databases, MEDLINE via Ovid, Embase, APA PsycInfo, and CINAHL. Further searches were performed in IEEE, Scopus, and Web of Science. The review considered studies reporting quantitative or qualitative data on perceptions and experiences of PwMS and HCPs concerning wearables’ usability, satisfaction, barriers, and facilitators. Results: 10 studies were included in this review. Wearables’ usefulness and accessibility, ease of use, awareness, and motivational tool potential were patient-perceived facilitators of use. Barriers related to anxiety and frustration, complexity, and the design of wearables. Perceived usefulness and system requirements are identified as facilitators of using wearables by HCPs, while data security concerns and fears of increased workload and limited effectiveness in the care plan are identified as barriers to use wearables. Conclusions: This review contributes to our understanding of the benefits of wearable technologies in MS by exploring perceptions of both PwMS and HCPs. The scoping review provided a broad overview of facilitators and barriers to wearable use in MS. There is a need for further studies underlined with sound theoretical frameworks to provide a robust evidence-base for the optimal use of wearables to empower healthcare users and providers. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - The early detection of fatal diseases is crucial for medical diagnostics and treatment, both of which benefit the individual and society. Portable devices, such as thermometers and blood pressure monitors, and large instruments, such as computed tomography (CT) and X-ray scanners, have already been implemented to collect health-related information. However, collecting health information using conventional medical equipment at home or in a hospital can be inefficient and can potentially affect the timeliness of treatment. Therefore, on-time vital signal collection via healthcare monitoring has received increasing attention. As the largest organ of the human body, skin delivers significant signals reflecting our health condition; thus, receiving vital signals directly from the skin offers the opportunity for accessible and versatile non-invasive monitoring. In particular, emerging flexible and stretchable electronics demonstrate the capability of skin-like devices for on-time and continuous long-term health monitoring. Compared to traditional electronic devices, this type of device has better mechanical properties, such as skin conformal attachment, and maintains compatible detectability. This review divides the health information that can be obtained from skin using the sensor aspect’s input energy forms into five categories: thermoelectrical signals, neural electrical signals, photoelectrical signals, electrochemical signals, and mechanical pressure signals. We then summarize current skin-wearable health monitoring devices and provide outlooks on future development. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Nurse engagement, perceived need and usefulness affect healthcare technology use, acceptance and improvements in quality, safety and accessibility of healthcare. Nurses’ opinions regarding continuous monitoring appear to be positive. However, facilitators and barriers were little studied. This study explored nurses’ post-implementation experiences of the facilitators and barriers to continuously monitoring patients’ vital signs using a wireless device on general hospital wards. Methods: This study employed a cross-sectional survey. Vocational and registered nurses from three general wards in a Dutch tertiary university hospital participated in a survey comprising open and closed questions. The data were analysed using thematic analysis and descriptive statistics. Results: Fifty-eight nurses (51.3%) completed the survey. Barriers and facilitators were identified under four key themes: (1) timely signalling and early action, (2) time savings and time consumption, (3) patient comfort and satisfaction and (4) preconditions. Conclusions: According to nurses, early detection and intervention for deteriorating patients facilitate the use and acceptance of continuously monitoring vital signs. Barriers primarily concern difficulties connecting patients correctly to the devices and system. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - This article presents a novel hardware-assisted distributed ledger-based solution for simultaneous device and data security in smart healthcare. This article presents a novel architecture that integrates PUF, blockchain, and Tangle for Security-by-Design (SbD) of healthcare cyber–physical systems (H-CPSs). Healthcare systems around the world have undergone massive technological transformation and have seen growing adoption with the advancement of Internet-of-Medical Things (IoMT). The technological transformation of healthcare systems to telemedicine, e-health, connected health, and remote health is being made possible with the sophisticated integration of IoMT with machine learning, big data, artificial intelligence (AI), and other technologies. As healthcare systems are becoming more accessible and advanced, security and privacy have become pivotal for the smooth integration and functioning of various systems in H-CPSs. In this work, we present a novel approach that integrates PUF with IOTA Tangle and blockchain and works by storing the PUF keys of a patient’s Body Area Network (BAN) inside blockchain to access, store, and share globally. Each patient has a network of smart wearables and a gateway to obtain the physiological sensor data securely. To facilitate communication among various stakeholders in healthcare systems, IOTA Tangle’s Masked Authentication Messaging (MAM) communication protocol has been used, which securely enables patients to communicate, share, and store data on Tangle. The MAM channel works in the restricted mode in the proposed architecture, which can be accessed using the patient’s gateway PUF key. Furthermore, the successful verification of PUF enables patients to securely send and share physiological sensor data from various wearable and implantable medical devices embedded with PUF. Finally, healthcare system entities like physicians, hospital admin networks, and remote monitoring systems can securely establish communication with patients using MAM and retrieve the patient’s BAN PUF keys from the blockchain securely. Our experimental analysis shows that the proposed approach successfully integrates three security primitives, PUF, blockchain, and Tangle, providing decentralized access control and security in H-CPS with minimal energy requirements, data storage, and response time. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) usage has increased due to advancements in information and communication systems. IoT technologies in contemporary healthcare applications connect doctors and patients for automated and knowledgeable everyday activity monitoring for older adults and older adults. The use of wearable body sensors and mobile devices to track personal health care is becoming more widespread. Wearable sensor technology is one of the key IoT advancements in healthcare tracking systems. IoT integration in healthcare has also sparked the development of intelligent apps like smart healthcare and sophisticated healthcare monitoring systems. Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has received a lot of interest from pervasive computing researchers working on smart healthcare systems. Patients with heart disease, obesity, and diabetes must engage in regular physical activity as part of their therapy plan. Some people with mental illnesses must monitor their everyday physical activity to avoid unfavorable conditions. As a result, identifying and keeping track of physical human activity can help a health professional evaluate a patient’s behavior in terms of their health. HAR system must, therefore, be made accessible to end users to protect their health. Over the past few decades, much work has gone into developing a strong and reliable framework for action recognition and prediction. In this chapter, we discuss the trends and challenges of machine learning-based HAR systems and offer solutions for them. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - This paper discusses the design and implementation of an Internet of Things (IoT)-based telemedicine health monitoring system (THMS) with an early warning scoring (EWS) function that reads, assesses, and logs physiological parameters of a patient such as body temperature, oxygen saturation level, systemic arterial pressure, breathing patterns, pulse (heart) rate, supplemental oxygen dependency, consciousness, and pain level using Particle Photon microcontrollers interfaced with biosensors and switches. The Mandami fuzzy inference-based medical decision support system (FI-MDSS) was also developed using MATLAB to assist medical professionals in evaluating a patient’s health risk and deciding on the appropriate clinical intervention. The patient’s physiological measurements, EWS, and health risk category are stored on the Particle cloud and Thing Speak cloud platforms and can be accessed remotely and in real-time via the Internet. Furthermore, a RESTful application programming interface (API) was developed using GO language and PostgreSQL database to enhance data presentation and accessibility. Based on the paired samples t-tests obtained from 6 sessions with 10 trials for each vital sign per session, there were no significant differences between the clinical data obtained from the designed prototype and the commercially sold medical equipment. The mean differences between the compared samples for each physiological data were not more than 0.40, the standard deviations were less than 2.3, and the p-values were greater than 0.05. With a 96.67% accuracy, the FI-MDSS predicted health risk levels that were comparable to conventional EWS techniques such as the Modified National Early Warning Score (m-NEWS) and NEWS2, which are used in the clinical decision-making process for managing patients with COVID-19 and other infectious illnesses. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Introduction: Patient initiated, remote cardiac monitoring has proved to be a significant advance in the diagnosis and management of arrhythmias. Further improvements in ease of use and access to results will further improve health outcomes and cost-effectiveness. Here we describe a proof-of-concept evaluation to assess the feasibility of successfully implementing a cloud-based management system using KardiaPro (KP) for remote electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring to interface into EPIC, an enterprise electronic health record (EHR) system. Methods: The KP management system was embedded using hypertext markup language (HTML) code directly into the EHR. Encrypted credentials and patient data were bundled with an application programming interface key allowing linkage of remote monitoring from patients’ smartphones. During the time of implementation, a total of 322 patients and 32 179 ECGs were recorded. Results: The KP-EHR interface provided full functionality, allowing detection, interpretation and documentation of atrial fibrillation (AF), flutter events, ventricular tachycardia, and complete heart block. Our study focused on KP’s detection of AF, and 16.7% of tracings were classified as probable AF with only 2.3% of tracings not analyzed by the KP algorithm because of tracings that were too noisy or truncated. Enhanced management was facilitated with clinical information immediately accessible. Blinded physician ECG review validated the KP proprietary algorithm interpretation and ECGs. Conclusions: Direct integration of KP into EHR was successful and practical. It allows for historical, point of care and immediate retrieval of remote ambulatory monitoring data and documentation into the electronic health record. KP EHR integration warrants further study as it has the potential to improve cost-effectiveness and clinical diagnostic value, leading to improvements in delivery of patient care. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Through the development of virtual and remote interaction applications for patients with the Internet of Things, the health sector is greatly accessible and affordable. Physically unstable patients can overcome the difficulty of consulting a doctor regularly by taking advantage of the capabilities of IoT technology. The text describes a conceptual framework of an IoT-based remote health monitoring system. Patients or the elderly can be monitored remotely at home using remote patient monitoring systems which can track their vital signs, including heart rate, temperature, and electrocardiogram remotely using handheld devices. Smart homes can be designed to be able to continuously monitor the health and wellbeing of elderly people through the use of wearables, technology, and communication. Moreover, smart homes may enable elders to live comfortably at home rather than visit high priced and inferior healthcare facilities. Intelligent hybrid systems employ both cloud-based and local components for applications targeting patients under supervision at home. Using the cloud-based component of the model, it is possible to store and analyze big data from a smart environment in order to track chronically ill individuals at home, particularly the elderly. During internet outages or other problems with the cloud system, an application of the model monitors the status of individuals. Physiological, physical, and ambient data are continuously monitored to determine the patient's current wellness using context-aware techniques. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Background: Cancer is likely to remain the most prevalent noncommunicable disease in high-income countries with an older population. Interestingly, no review of attitudes toward telemedicine among older adults has been performed. This is likely to be the group most affected by both cancer and the increasing use of technology in health care. Objective: We aimed to map research on the acceptance of telemedicine among older adults who are cancer patients. Methods: We conducted a scoping review. PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were systematically searched from inception to September 2020. Articles were included if the study population had a mean or median age ≥65 years, with cancer diagnoses and if the study assessed patients’ acceptance of a telemedicine intervention. Quantitative, qualitative, and mixed method studies were included. Results: Out of a total of 887 articles that were identified, 19 were included in the review. Interventions were delivered via telephone, videoconference, web portal, mobile app, wearable technology, and text messaging and included teleconsultation, monitoring and follow-up, psychosocial support and nursing care, and prompts. The most often cited facilitating factor was convenience. Other facilitators included an increase in telemedicine care accessibility, previous positive experiences of telemedicine, appropriate technical knowledge and support, decreased cost, physician recommendations, and privacy conferred by the telemedicine intervention. Barriers include a preference for conventional care along with negative perceptions of telemedicine, concerns about technical difficulties, and confidentiality concerns in the adoption of telemedicine. Conclusions: None of the studies explored the ability of tailored interventions to address facilitators and barriers of the acceptance of telemedicine in order to increase its adoption by older adults. Facilitators and barriers will likely differ across different cultural contexts and by type of telemedicine; however, this is a gap in current knowledge. In-depth studies are necessary to determine if interventions could potentially address the barriers identified in this review, to increase acceptability. © 2022 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

AB  - Due to COVID-19, the attempt to access medical facilities has increased. But, physical meetings are the biggest reason for the global pandemic. The healthcare industry is in a dire state of despair because of the spread of COVID, constrained health workers, and infrastructure. Healthcare accommodations are costlier than ever due to various reasons such as the global population getting busier and the rise in the number of chronic diseases. Nowadays, there is a high demand for healthcare support due to the increase in the aging population, the COVID-19 crisis, its postdisease difficulties, and other chronic diseases. Treating all the patients at hospitals is not practical nowadays due to limited healthcare facilities. The patients' care is all dependent on visits to the hospital physically, and to some extent, calls, text messages, and emails. This way it was not possible for the doctors to monitor the health of the patients continuously and assist them whenever needed. Recently, the Internet of Things (IoT) and various machine learning approaches have been widely explored in this sector. The IoT-based healthcare methods provide quality and efficiency during treatment. The IoT along with machine learning techniques can transform the healthcare industry by making it more accessible and less costly and make healthcare more facile by equipping the users with pocket amicable medical facilities. With IoT-enabled devices, remote monitoring can enable patients to better connect with doctors, thereby minimizing physical visits. It can equip doctors to easily keep track of their patient's health by utilizing wearables like fitness bands that can monitor various healthcare parameters. All these systems mostly use machine learning or deep learning approaches. This way, they will know whether to offer any immediate medical care or to make any changes to the current treatment. This chapter gives a detailed discussion on IoT and machine learning in the healthcare sector and the security concerns in this domain along with the major research challenges. © 2023 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

The energy from respiration featured with excellent stability, accessibility and continuality inspires the design and engineering of biomechanical energy harvesting devices, such as triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs), to realize human-powered electronics. This review article is thus dedicated to the emerging respiration-driven TENG technology, covering fundamentals, applications, and perspectives. Specifically, the human breathing mechanics are first introduced serving as the base for the developments of TENG devices with different configurations. Biomedical applications including electrical energy generation, healthcare monitoring, air filtration, gas sensing, electrostimulation, and powering implantable medical devices are then analyzed focusing on the design-application relationships. At last, current developments are summarized and critical challenges for driving these intriguing developments toward practical applications are discussed together with promising solutions.

AB  - Background: Monitoring mental health outcomes has traditionally been based on heuristic decisions, often based on scarce, subjective evidence, making the clinical decisions made by professionals, as well as the monitoring of these diseases, subject to flaws. However, the digital phenotype, which refers to the analysis of data collected by measuring human behavior with mobile sensors and smart bracelets, is a promising tool for filling this gap in current clinical practice. Objective: The objectives of this study are to develop the digital phenotyping of patients with alcohol use disorder and anxiety symptoms using data collected from a mobile device (ie, smartphone) and a wearable sensor (ie, Fitbit) and to analyze usability and patient satisfaction with the data collection service provided by the app. Methods: We propose to conduct a study among a group of 60 participants split into two subgroups—experimental and control—of 30 participants each. The experimental group will be recruited by physicians from the Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, and the control group will be recruited on a volunteer basis through fliers and social media. All participants will go through pretraining to ensure technological capability and understanding of tasks, then each participant will download the HumanITcare app and will be given a wearable sensor (ie, Fitbit). Throughout the 4-month period, participants will be monitored on a range of factors, including sleep cycle, heart rate, movement patterns, and sociability. All data from the wearable sensors and the mobile devices will be saved and sent to the HumanITcare server. Participants will be asked to complete weekly questionnaires about anxiety, depression, and alcohol use disorder symptoms. Research assistants will ensure timely responses. The data from both sensors will then be compared to the questionnaire responses to determine how accurately the devices can predict the same symptoms. Results: The recruitment phase was completed in November 2019 and all the data were collected by the end of December 2019. Data are being processed; this process is expected to be completed by October 2020. Conclusions: This study was created and conducted as a pilot study with the Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, with the purpose of exploring the feasibility of our approach. The study is focused on patients diagnosed with anxiety and alcohol use disorder, but participants were also monitored for depressive symptoms throughout the trial, although these were not part of the initial inclusion criteria. A limitation to our study was the exclusive use of Android smartphones over iOS devices; this could result in a potential selection bias, due to the accessibility and affordability of Android phones as opposed to iOS-based phones. Another limitation might be that reviews of usability and satisfaction could be confounded by factors such as age and familiarity. An additional function that we might add in future studies is the ability for patients to manage their own data. ©Núria Pastor, Elizabeth Khalilian, Elsa Caballeria, Danielle Morrison, Unai Sanchez Luque, Silvia Matrai, Antoni Gual, Hugo López-Pelayo.

AB  - Due to the serious impact of falls on the autonomy and health of older people, the investigation of wearable alerting systems for the automatic detection of falls has gained considerable scientific interest in the field of body telemonitoring with wireless sensors. Because of the difficulties of systematically validating these systems in a real application scenario, Fall Detection Systems (FDSs) are typically evaluated by studying their response to datasets containing inertial sensor measurements captured during the execution of labelled nonfall and fall movements. In this context, during the last decade, numerous publicly accessible databases have been released aiming at offering a common benchmarking tool for the validation of the new proposals on FDSs. This work offers a comparative and updated analysis of these existing repositories. For this purpose, the samples contained in the datasets are characterized by different statistics that model diverse aspects of the mobility of the human body in the time interval where the greatest change in the acceleration module is identified. By using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) on the series of these features, the comparison shows the significant differences detected between the datasets, even when comparing activities that require a similar degree of physical effort. This heterogeneity, which may result from the great variability of the sensors, experimental users, and testbeds employed to generate the datasets, is relevant because it casts doubt on the validity of the conclusions of many studies on FDSs, since most of the proposals in the literature are only evaluated using a single database. © 2020 Eduardo Casilari et al.

AB  - Advances in cancer therapeutics have dramatically improved the survival rate and quality of life in patients affected by various cancers, but have been accompanied by treatment-related cardiotoxicity, e.g. left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and/or overt heart failure (HF). Cardiologists thus need to assess cancer treatment-related cardiotoxic risks and have close followups for cancer survivors and patients undergoing cancer treatments using serial echocardiography exams and cardiovascular biomarkers testing. Unfortunately, the cost-prohibitive nature of echocardiography has made these routine follow-ups difficult and not accessible to the growing number of cancer survivors and patients undergoing cancer treatments. There is thus a need to develop a wearable system that can yield similar information at a minimal cost and can be used for remote monitoring of these patients. In this proof-of-concept study, we have investigated the use of wearable seismocardiography (SCG) to monitor LV function non-invasively for patients undergoing cancer treatment. A total of 12 subjects (six with normal LV relaxation, five with impaired relaxation and one with pseudo-normal relaxation) underwent routine echocardiography followed by a standard six-minute walk test. Wearable SCG and electrocardiogram signals were collected during the six-minute walk test and, later, the signal features were compared between subjects with normal and impaired LV relaxation. Pre-ejection period (PEP) from SCG decreased significantly (p < 0.05) during exercise for the subjects with impaired relaxation compared to the subjects with normal relaxation, and changes in PEP/LV ejection time (LVET) were also significantly different between these two groups (p < 0.05). These results suggest that wearable SCG may enable monitoring of patients undergoing cancer treatments by assessing cardiotoxicity. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - The flexible and wearable capacitive pressure sensors are widely used in healthcare monitoring, robotics manufacture and military equipment. These types of highly sensitive pressure sensors can be realized by designing micro-structure electrodes or dielectric layers on a wearable smart device. Herein, we prepare a flexible and conductive electrode through electrospinning of palladium ions (Pd2+)/polyacrylonitrile (PAN) solution and followed by electroless plating of the hybrid nanofibrous membranes. The FESEM images showed that the obtained conductive nanofibrous membrane was covered by a coral-like silver layer with porosity benefiting for excellent electrical conductivity. Based on the superior performance, it is used as the electrodes and jointly assembled into a full microporous structure sensor with the high-mesh nylon netting. Benefitting from the dramatically alterable contact area of the electrode and the good dielectricity of nylon netting, the as-prepared sensor exhibits a high sensitivity of 1.49 kPa−1, a fast response time of 48 ms, low hysteresis of 7.55% and stable durability over 1000 cycles. Besides, practical human motions’ detection is carried out by this wearable pressure sensor. The simulation of the finite elemental analysis is used to explain the mechanism of the sensor. This fabrication method is facile, low-cost, and less metal pollution, which may provide an insight to design microstructures for improving the performance, and imply an accessible prospect in the industrialization of sensors. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - On account of privacy preserving issue and health-care monitoring, physiological signal biometric authentication system has gained popularity in recent years. Seismocardiogram (SCG) is now easily accessible owing to the advance of wearable sensor technology. However, SCG biometric has not been widely explored due to the challenging motion artifact removal. In this paper, we design placing the sensors at different body parts under different activities to determine the best sensor location. In addition, we develop SCG noise removal algorithm and utilize machine learning approach to perform biometric authentication tasks. We validate the proposed methods on 20 healthy young adults. The dataset contains acceleration data of sitting, standing, walking, and sitting post-exercise activities with the sensor placed at the wrists, neck, heart and sternum. We demonstrate that vertical and dorsal-ventral SCG near the heart and the sternum produce reliable SCG biometric evidenced by achieving the state-of-The-Art performance. Moreover, we present the efficacy of the devised noise removal procedure in the authentication during walking motion.Clinical relevance-A seismocardiography-based biometric authentication system can help serve privacy preserving and reveal cardiovascular functioning information in clinics.  © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Background: There is a high prevalence of older adults experiencing depression and anxiety. In response to heightened demands for mental health interventions that are accessible and affordable, there has been a recent rise in the number of digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) that have been developed and incorporated into mental health treatments. Digital interventions are promising in their ability to provide researchers, medical practitioners, and patients with personalized tools for assessing behavior, consultation, treatment, and care that can be used remotely. Reviews and meta-analyses have shown the benefits of DMHIs for the treatment and prevention of depression, anxiety, and other mental illnesses, but there is still a lack of studies that focus on the benefits and use of DMHIs in the older population. Objective: The aim of this systematic review is to investigate the current evidence for the effect of technology-delivered interventions, such as smartphone/tablet applications, remote monitoring and tracking devices, and wearable technology, for the treatment and prevention of depression and anxiety in adults older than 50 years. Methods: The academic databases SCOPUS, PsycINFO, AgeLine (EBSCO), and Medline (PubMed) will be searched from January 1, 2010, to the date of search commencement to provide a review of existing randomized controlled trial studies. The search will include 3 key concepts: “older adults,” “digital intervention,” and “depression/anxiety.” A set of inclusion criteria will be followed during screening by two reviewers. Data will be extracted to address aims and objectives of the review. The risk of bias for each study will be determined using appropriate tools. If possible, a random-effects meta-analysis will be performed, and the heterogeneity of effect sizes will be calculated. Results: Preliminary searches were conducted in September 2020. The review is anticipated to be completed by April 2021. Conclusions: The data accumulated in this systematic review will demonstrate the potential benefits of technology-delivered interventions for the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders in older adults. This review will also identify any gaps in current studies of aging and mental health interventions, thereby navigating a way to move forward and paving the path to more accessible and user-friendly digital health interventions for the diverse population of older adults. ©Indira Riadi, Lucy Kervin, Kelly Teo, Ryan Churchill, Theodore D Cosco.

AB  - Mobile and wearable technologies offer patients with diabetes mellitus new possibilities for data collection and their more effective analysis. The Diabesdagboga smartphone application and the Diani web portal enable to collect and analyze glycaemia values, carbohydrates intake, insulin doses and the level of physical activity. The data are not only accessible in the corresponding smartphone but also automatically transferred to an Internet portal, where they may be completed by the records from an electronic pedometer and continuous glucose monitor. All these data may then be displayed in various types of graphical outputs and are available to both the patient and the physician. The case report of a patient who has used the system for almost two years shows a significant improvement in metabolic compensation (a decrease in the mean HbA1c value by 18.6 mmol/mol as compared with the previous period).

AB  - The increasing prevalence of diabetes, combined with a growing global shortage of health care professionals (HCP), necessitates the need to develop new approaches to diabetes care delivery to expand access to care, lessen the burden on people with diabetes, improve efficiencies, and reduce the unsustainable financial liability on health systems and payers. Use of digital diabetes technologies and telehealth protocols within a digital/virtual diabetes clinic has the potential to address these challenges. However, several issues must be resolved to move forward. In February 2020, organizers of the Advanced Technologies & Treatments for Diabetes Annual Conference convened an international panel of HCP, researchers, patient advocates, and industry representatives to review the status of digital diabetes technologies, characterize deficits in current technologies, and identify issues for consideration. Since that meeting, the importance of using telehealth and digital diabetes technologies has been demonstrated amid the global coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. This article summarizes the panel's discussion of the opportunities, obstacles, and requisites for advancing the use of these technologies as a standard of care for the management of diabetes. © 2021, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.

AB  - Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a fast-progressive neurodegenerative disease leading to progressive physical immobility with usually normal or mild cognitive and/or behavioural involvement. Many patients are relatively young, instructed, sensitive to new technologies, and professionally active when developing the first symptoms. Older patients usually require more time, encouragement, reinforcement and a closer support but, nevertheless, selecting user-friendly devices, provided earlier in the course of the disease, and engaging motivated carers may overcome many technological barriers. ALS may be considered a model for neurodegenerative diseases to further develop and test new technologies. From multidisciplinary teleconsults to telemonitoring of the respiratory function, telemedicine has the potentiality to embrace other fields, including nutrition, physical mobility, and the interaction with the environment. Brain-computer interfaces and eye tracking expanded the field of augmentative and alternative communication in ALS but their potentialities go beyond communication, to cognition and robotics. Virtual reality and different forms of artificial intelligence present further interesting possibilities that deserve to be investigated. COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented opportunity to speed up the development and implementation of new technologies in clinical practice, improving the daily living of both ALS patients and carers. The present work reviews the current technologies for ALS patients already in place or being under evaluation with published publications, prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020

AB  - After a cerebral stroke, survivors need to follow a neurorehabilitation program including exercises to be executed under a therapist's supervision or autonomously. Technological solutions are needed to support the early discharge of the patients just after the primary hospital treatments, by still providing an adequate level of rehabilitation. The DoMoMEA Project proposes a fully-wearable m-health solution able to administer a neurorehabilitation therapy in the patient's home or every other place established by the patient for a rehabilitation session. The exploitation of magneto-inertial measurement units only, wirelessly connected to an Android-operated device, provides robustness to different operating conditions and immunity to optical occlusion problems, compared to RGB-D cameras. Patients' engagement is fostered by the exploitation of the exergame version of the ten rehabilitation exercises, implemented in Unity 3D. Store-and-forward telemonitoring features, supported by cloud-based storage and by a web application accessible from anywhere by medical personnel and patients, enable constant transparent monitoring of the rehabilitation progresses. The clinical trial of the DoMoMEA telerehabilitation system will involve 40 post-stroke patients with mild impairment and will start as soon as the restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic will allow to enroll patients. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - The increasing ageing global population is causing an upsurge in ailments related to old age, primarily dementia and Alzheimer’s disease, frailty, Parkinson’s, and cardiovascular disease, but also a general need for general eldercare as well as active and healthy ageing. In turn, there is a need for constant monitoring and assistance, intervention, and support, causing a considerable financial and human burden on individuals and their caregivers. Interconnected sensing technology, such as IoT wearables and devices, present a promising solution for objective, reliable, and remote monitoring, assessment, and support through ambient assisted living. This paper presents a review of such solutions including both earlier review studies and individual case studies, rapidly evolving in the last decade. In doing so, it examines and categorizes them according to common aspects of interest such as health focus, from specific ailments to general eldercare; IoT technologies, from wearables to smart home sensors; aims, from assessment to fall detection and indoor positioning to intervention; and experimental evaluation participants duration and outcome measures, from acceptability to accuracy. Statistics drawn from this categorization aim to outline the current state-of-the-art, as well as trends and effective practices for the future of effective, accessible, and acceptable eldercare with technology. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Background Breast cancer, one of the most common invasive cancers for women both in the developed and developing world, poses a threat as a multi-dimensional malignancy branching out into an array of medical, physical, financial, social, emotional and sexual turmoil. This paper reports research that has been carried out in an academic pursuit for answers to queries encapsulating the social perception, impact and aftermath of breast cancer—affiliated healthcare systems, effective caregiving, healthy coping and holistic healing mechanisms. Objective The study aims at presenting the illness and its negative imprints as a cumulative concern, instead of singularly scrutinizing it through a clinical lens. It urges practitioners and caregivers to innovate and intervene at three identified and overlapping target phases of the journey: (i) awareness and diagnosis, (ii) short-term healing and (iii) long-term recovery. Methodology With underlying system design practices, this qualitative study was conducted as a part of a visual communication project under the graphic design department at National Institute of Design, Ahmedabad. The deployed methodology made use of empathy mapping, opportunity mapping, gigamaping, interviews and questionnaires as tools to engage the two stakeholder groups, one including health care providers, patients and their support systems personifying direct stakeholders of the journey and the second being a group of general participants embodying indirect stakeholders. Conclusion This approach devised cancer positive, a collective and curative movement, which provides a systemic solution to downsize the trauma of the illness, foster interpersonal relationships and eradicate the perceived and actual stigma attached to breast cancer. The proffered system provides strategies for accessible and responsive caregiving, remote monitoring, telemedicine and behavioural modification by proposing an allocated breast cancer data unit. This paper primarily elaborates on the design rationale that suggests the imperative need of an all-inclusive recovery-centric approach instead of a mere survival outlook towards the life-threatening phenomenon. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Objective: Preservation of patient’s medical information in health care industries under Medical Sensor Networks (MSN). Methods: This paper proposes a novel key management technique known as k-secure with FBKM, which generates a robust key to allow communication between sensors present in the Body Sensor Units (BSU) and Body Central Unit (BCU). This proposed work strengthens the FBKM technique which is placed between BCU and the point accessible to medical experts at a remote place in the overall health care monitoring environment. Results: The FBKM technique has proved its success in authentication and security by improving genuine acceptance rate, false rejection rate, and declining false acceptance rate. Conclusion: The k-secure with FBKM scheme enhances the performance of the existing FBKM scheme in Medical Sensor Networks. © 2021 Karunakaran and Rajagopal.

AB  - Healthcare studies are moving toward individualised measurement. There is need to move beyond supervised assessments in the laboratory/clinic. Longitudinal free-living assessment can provide a wealth of information on patient pathology and habitual behaviour, but cost and complexity of equipment have typically been a barrier. Lack of supervised conditions within free-living assessment means there is need to augment these studies with environmental analysis to provide context to individual measurements. This paper reviews low-cost and accessible Internet of Things (IoT) technologies with the aim of informing biomedical engineers of possibilities, workflows and limitations they present. In doing so, we evidence their use within healthcare research through literature and experimentation. As hardware becomes more affordable and feature rich, the cost of data magnifies. This can be limiting for biomedical engineers exploring low-cost solutions as data costs can make IoT approaches unscalable. IoT technologies can be exploited by biomedical engineers, but more research is needed before these technologies can become commonplace for clinicians and healthcare practitioners. It is hoped that the insights provided by this paper will better equip biomedical engineers to lead and monitor multi-disciplinary research investigations. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Telemonitoring is a branch of telehealth that aims at remotely monitoring vital signs, which is important for chronically ill patients and the elderly living alone. The available standalone devices and applications for the self-monitoring of health parameters largely suffer from interoperability problems; meanwhile, telemonitoring medical devices are expensive, self-contained, and are not integrated into user-friendly technological platforms for the end user. This paper presents the technical aspects and usability assessment of the telemonitoring features of the HEREiAM platform, which supports heterogeneous information technology systems. By exploiting a service-oriented architecture, the measured parameters collected by off-the-shelf Bluetooth medical devices are sent as XML documents to a private cloud that implements an interoperable health service infrastructure, which is compliant with the most recent healthcare standards and security protocols. This Android-based system is designed to be accessible both via TV and portable devices, and includes other utilities designed to support the elderly living alone. Four usability assessment sessions with quality-validated questionnaires were performed to accurately understand the ease of use, usefulness, acceptance, and quality of the proposed system. The results reveal that our system achieved very high usability scores even at its first use, and the scores did not significantly change over time during a field trial that lasted for four months, reinforcing the idea of an intuitive design. At the end of such a trial, the user-experience questionnaire achieved excellent scores in all aspects with respect to the benchmark. Good results were also reported by general practitioners who assessed the quality of their remote interfaces for telemonitoring. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The development of high-performance glucose sensors is an urgent need, especially for diabetes mellitus diagnosis. However, the glucose monitoring is conventionally operated in an invasive finger-prick manner and their noninvasive alternatives largely suffered from the relatively poor sensitivity, selectivity, and stability, resulted from the lack of robust and efficient catalysts. In this paper, we design a concave shaped nitrogen-doped carbon framework embellished with single Co site catalyst (Co SSC) by selectively controlling the etching rate on different facet of carbon substrate, which is beneficial to the diffusion and contact of analyte. The Co SSC prompts a significant improvement in the sensitivity of the solution-gated graphene transistor (SGGT) devices, with three orders of magnitude better than those of SGGT devices without catalysts. Our findings expand the field of single site catalyst in the application of biosensors, diabetes diagnostics and personalized health-care monitoring. © 2020 Science China Press

AB  - Background: Adhesive capsulitis (AC) of the shoulder is a common disorder that painfully reduces the shoulder range of motion (ROM) among middle-aged individuals. Although physical therapy with home-based exercises is widely advised to restore ROM in the treatment of AC, clinical results vary owing to inconsistent patient compliance. Objective: In this study, we aimed to verify the feasibility of a treatment model that involves applying a wearable motion sensor device to assist patients conduct home-based exercises to improve training compliance and the accuracy of exercises, with the ultimate goal of improving the functional recovery of patients with AC. Methods: The motion sensor device was comprised of inertial measurement unit-based sensors and mobile apps for patients and physicians, offering shoulder mobility tracing, home-based exercise support, and progress monitoring. The interrater reliability of shoulder mobility measurement using the motion sensor device on 10 healthy participants and 15 patients with AC was obtained using an intraclass correlation coefficient analysis and compared with the assessments performed by two highly experienced physicians. A pilot prospective control trial was then carried out to allocate the 15 patients with AC to two groups: home-based exercise group and motion sensor-assisted rehabilitation group. Changes in active and passive shoulder ROM, pain and functional scores, and exercise completion rates were compared between the groups during a treatment period of 3 months. Results: Shoulder ROM, as measured using the motion sensor device, exhibited good to excellent reliability based on the comparison with the measurements of two physicians (intraclass correlation coefficient range, 0.771 to 0.979). Compared with patients with AC in the home-based exercise group, those in the motion sensor-assisted rehabilitation group exhibited better shoulder mobility and functional recovery and a higher exercise completion rate during and after 3 months of rehabilitation. Conclusions: Motion sensor device-assisted home-based rehabilitation for the treatment of AC is a useful treatment model for telerehabilitation that enhances the compliance of patients through training, thus improving functional recovery. This helps overcome important obstacles in physiotherapy at home by providing comprehensible and easily accessible exercise instructions, enhancing compliance, ensuring the correctness of exercise, and monitoring the progress of patients. © 2020 Yu-Pin Chen.

AB  - Mobile and wearable technologies offer patients with diabetes mellitus new possibilities for data collection and their more effective analysis. The Diabesdagboga smartphone application and the Diani web portal enable to collect and analyze glycaemia values, carbohydrates intake, insulin doses and the level of physical activity. The data are not only accessible in the corresponding smartphone but also automatically transferred to an Internet portal, where they may be completed by the records from an electronic pedometer and continuous glucose monitor. All these data may then be displayed in various types of graphical outputs and are available to both the patient and the physician. The case report of a patient who has used the system for almost two years shows a significant improvement in metabolic compensation (a decrease in the mean HbA1c value by 18.6 mmol/mol as compared with the previous period). © 2020, Facta Medica, S.R.O.

AB  - Thanks to the development of information and communication technologies, the application of telematic instrumentation allows the implementation of a virtual instrumentation system that contains an electronic interface with remote co-communication that gives medical personnel the facility to communicate at a distance between the nursing assistant and the patients, in such a way that the medical professional can perform monitoring and control in the treatment of neuromuscular diseases, regardless of the place of origin where the patient is located. This article describes the development of a remote virtual instrumentation system oriented to support the area of physiatry and rehabilitation of a health establishment. Due to modern technological advances in biomedical instruction, there are technological devices that can be optimized as instruments for the acquisition, monitoring, and processing of bioelectric signals, to such an extent that it has facilitated the implementation of medical equipment consisting of an electromyograph and an electro-stimulator; this allows data to be sent and received over long distances, which causes radical changes with certain advantages that contribute to the quality of medical care. In this sense, it can be asserted that the execution of the research allows the development of a functional technological strategy for the diagnosis and treatment of neuromuscular diseases with the sole objective of covering vulnerable rural areas where the medical accessibility of their inhabitants is limited. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Introduction. Urolithiasis is a clinically and socially significant disease that requires long-term follow-up in order to prevent stone recurrence. Currently, telemedicine consultations in the "patient-doctor" format are actively used in urology, however, the methodology, technological base and assessment of the efficiency of remote monitoring of the patient's health status are virtually not developed. Aim. To provide basics for the methodology of remote monitoring of patients with urolithiasis for detailed comprehensive examination and comprehensive metaphylaxis of recurrent stone formation. Materials and methods. A comprehensive clinical examination was carried out on the basis of the Institute of Urology and Human Reproductive Health, the National Medical Research Center on Urology and the Institute of Digital Medicine of FGAOU VO I.M. Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University during the period from 1st February to 1st December 2020. A total of 30 patients with urolithiasis were included in the study. Remote monitoring of health status was carried out using a portable analyzer "ETTA AMP-01" on dipstick. Data transmission was performed through a mobile application, which is part of the "NetHealth" information system (www.nethealth.ru). The values and frequency of urine tests performed by the patient independently, as well as patient satisfaction and adherence to the monitoring technology were evaluated. Analytical, clinical, sociological and statistical research methods were used. Results. By systematizing published data and our own clinical experience, we have developed a model for remote monitoring of the health status of patients with urinary stone disease, which included a system of indications and contraindications, a program and an order of the monitoring, as well as a basic technological solution (medical devices and a hardware-software complex). In this study, median duration of remote monitoring was 168 days. According to the questionnaire, general positive assessment and desire to continue telemonitoring was seen in 100.0% of cases, while 86.7% of patients positively evaluated the technical accessibility and reliability of the system and 93.3% considered the quality and availability of medical care as high. Conclusion. A methodology for remote monitoring of patients with urolithiasis has been developed with the aim of preventing recurrent stone formation. There was a high adherence of patients to remote monitoring with a tendency to decrease in values after 4 and 6 months. During these periods, it is necessary to carry out routine consultations by the physician who appointed remote monitoring in order to continue the follow-up program. There was a high satisfaction of patients with remote monitoring, and they pointed out the quality and availability of urological care owing to telemedicine technologies. © 2021, Bionika Media Ltd..

AB  - The power of Internet of Things (IoT) has disrupted the traditional business models of industries, especially in healthcare industry. The emerging of connected sensors and devices, and the advancement of wireless technology, cloud computing, and data analytics, have been transforming the healthcare from case-based paid service to value-based care service. These value-based care services is known as IoT enabled healthcare applications. The aim of the IoT enabled healthcare is to eventually provide a low-cost, advanced technology, and high accessibility care services for patients and consumers. Some developed countries have been implementing the IoT enabled applications in healthcare sector and obtained satisfactory result. In this paper, Diffusion of Innovations (DOI) model was applied to study the IoT diffusion in public and Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was used to study the degree of IoT is accepted in public. In addition, survey questionnaire was developed to collect data from the public and consequently identify the barriers for Malaysia to embrace the IoT into healthcare sector. After going through the data collection, IoT enabled healthcare application is accepted by most of the respondents. IoT healthcare application is reaching the decision stage that Malaysian need more persuasion to encourage them to make the decision of using the IoT healthcare application. Lastly, six major barriers for service provider and public to adopt IoT healthcare application were then identified in this paper. © 2019 by Advance Scientific Research.

AB  - Tele-Health services provide people with healthcare assistance and help to establish accessible and high-quality monitoring. Telematic healthcare administration offers direct aid through the Internet of Things (IoT), which is better than current methods involving physical presence. The IoT and sensor networks currently enable remote monitoring of an individual or community. There are different Energy Level (EL) estimation methods for aerobics using body-worn sensors; however, quantification of error estimation differences is lacking. In this article, the Internet of Things based Energy Level Estimation method (IoT-ELEM) has been proposed for determining energy rates. The latter two forms of calculation are accompanied by a list of behaviors and EL approximations. Likewise, the amount and location of accelerometer sensors have been examined to achieve maximal EL estimates in aerobic players. The device is built on a distributed design that gathers a person's physiological data from various sensors data and conducts a standardization phase. These results are all transmitted to the cloud for storing and further processing. The cloud device manages the obtained details and performs a data fusion procedure to display the EL of the user at all stages. The IoT-ELEM system has been evaluated and achieves a high accuracy ratio of 98.6%, a prediction ratio of 96.4%, a performance ratio of 97.8, a less error rate of 9.4%, and an F1 score ratio of 94.6%. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The outbreak of COVID-19 hit the world with an incomparable magnitude and introduced new challenges in the diagnosis and treatment of patients. Personal interactions have suddenly become dangerous which can be reduced by the use of digital technology in healthcare. Towards this, we have developed a low-cost remote vital sign monitoring system (VSM) that can be used at hospitals as well as at home for continuous and long-term monitoring of different clinical status, and provide extended support to the vulnerable patients. The proposed VSM has been designed with four layers: sensing layer, data processing layer, networking layer, and applications layer. It comes with three units: a wrist unit, a bedside monitor and a web-based graphical user interface (GUI) accessible by the nurse, physician or attendants remotely from anywhere. The effectiveness of measurement, transmission, and remote monitoring has been demonstrated by experiments. The system is designed with open source and low-cost hardware devices to ensure that it can be afforded and implemented in low resource settings of the developing countries. The proposed system can provide an effective way of delivering care to more patients while protecting everyone involved from infection. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Lockdown and self-isolation are to date the only solution to limit the spread of recent outbreak of coronavirus disease (CoViD-19), highlighting the great advantage of home dialysis in a patient otherwise forced to travel from/to the dialysis center to receive this "life-saving" treatment. Indeed, to prevent spreading of CoViD-19 infection among extremely fragile dialysis patients, as well as among dialysis workers, hemodialysis (HD) centers are adopting specific procedures ("dedicated" dialysis facilities, portable osmosis, etc.) with a great economic and organizational commitment. Peritoneal dialysis (PD) represents a type of home dialysis therapy not yet adequately implemented to date, in spite of safe and simple practice, as well as similar dialytic efficiency vs in-center hemodialysis. Remote patient monitoring (RPM) systems have been developed in automated PD (APD) cyclers in order to improve the acceptance of this dialysis method, to increase the compliance to the prescribed therapy and to control treatment adequacy. In this review we assess the potential advantages of RPM in APD, that are the chance for patients to acquire greater independence and safety in the home treatment, to allow better access to care for residents in remote areas, faster resolution of problems, reduction in hospitalizations and mortality rates, as well as time and cost saving for both the patient and the staff. The use of medical devices (sphygmomanometer, glucometer, balance, etc.), connected by wireless to the clinician's portal, might also allow a wider diffusion of incremental dialysis, an integrated therapy that combines conservative management of ESKD patients with a soft dialysis based on the residual kidney function and symptomatology, with potential prognosis and economic benefits. Although the majority of the studies are small and observational, a wider use of RPM systems is desirable to broaden the spread of home dialysis, as we learnt from Coronavirus pandemic. © 2020 Il Pensiero Scientifico Editore s.r.l..

AB  - Electronic-based health care delivery systems are gaining popularity among patients and clinicians because of convenience. Importantly, telemedicine, the delivery of health care and/or health information using electronic systems, can deliver primary and specialized health care to geographically isolated patients, who account for nearly 20% of the US population. In nephrology, where a growing discrepancy exists between the geographic location of nephrologists and patients with kidney disease, telenephrology can bridge distance and deliver renal care and education to the isolated. Large nationalized health care systems, for which incentives are aligned to innovate and implement new platforms to deliver cost-effective care, have been at the forefront of telenephrology. These systems include synchronous direct physician-patient care through clinical videoconferencing, and asynchronous modalities such as electronic consultation and video telehealth to educate internists about specialized clinical topics. Large health care organizations are adopting these platforms as standalone services; however, expansion into the private health care system has been limited by reimbursement, regulations, and other issues. Though telenephrology is patient centered, studies are needed to rigorously test its clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness. Nonetheless, growing patient demand for patient-centric health care will continue to expand the telenephrology space. © 2020

AB  - Healthcare industry has been relegated to services of innovation and even we can say that healthcare industry has been slower to embrace the Internet of things (IoT) due to our earlier legitimate concern about security and privacy. But in the recent years and according to Deloitte report, it’s been noted that more than 500,000 medical technologies are currently accessible to collect, analyze and transmit healthcare data; evolving the future of healthcare services by allocating end to end data encryption security and providing greater privacy options to patient. And now when the whole world is facing the rapid expansion of COVID-19, where the social and physical distancing is a matter of concern for the frontline clinical healthcare provider and the patients, Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) had played an indispensable role in tackling COVID-19. It not only accelerates our response to this widespread pandemic but also offers many innovative solutions to retaliate this global issue. Remote monitoring and evaluating of large number COVID-19 patients in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or in ventilators by few medical health professionals, providing telemedicine services to the people dwelling in lockdown or quarantine, and encouraging behavioral modification of patients; has opened the door to more efficient healthcare delivery during this time of ‘New Normal’. With new technology, however comes new challenges which have to fix together to make this technology works more efficiently, especially in the rural areas, where it needs the most. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Internet of Medical Things (IoMTs) is fast emerging, thereby fostering rapid advances in the areas of sensing, actuation and connectivity to significantly improve the quality and accessibility of health care for everyone. Implantable medical device (IMD) is an example of such an IoMT-enabled device. IMDs treat the patient’s health and give a mechanism to provide regular remote monitoring to the healthcare providers. However, the current wireless communication channels can curb the security and privacy of these devices by allowing an attacker to interfere with both the data and communication. The privacy and security breaches in IMDs have thereby alarmed both the health providers and government agencies. Ensuring security of these small devices is a vital task to prevent severe health consequences to the bearer. The attacks can range from system to infrastructure levels where both the software and hardware of the IMD are compromised. In the recent years, biometric and cryptographic approaches to authentication, machine learning approaches to anomaly detection and external wearable devices for wireless communication protection have been proposed. However, the existing solutions for wireless medical devices are either heavy for memory constrained devices or require additional devices to be worn. To treat the present situation, there is a requirement to facilitate effective and secure data communication by introducing policies that will incentivize the development of security techniques. This paper proposes a novel electrocardiogram authentication scheme which uses Legendre approximation coupled with multi-layer perceptron model for providing three levels of security for data, network and application levels. The proposed model can reach up to 99.99% testing accuracy in identifying the authorized personnel even with 5 coefficients. © 2018, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.

AB  - Background: Vital sign measurements are an integral component of clinical care, but current challenges with the accuracy and timeliness of patient observations can impact appropriate clinical decision making. Advanced technologies using techniques such as photoplethysmography have the potential to automate noncontact physiological monitoring and recording, improving the quality and accessibility of this essential clinical information. Objective: In this study, we aim to develop the algorithm used in the Lifelight software application and improve the accuracy of its estimated heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and blood pressure measurements. Methods: This preliminary study will compare measurements predicted by the Lifelight software with standard of care measurements for an estimated population sample of 2000 inpatients, outpatients, and healthy people attending a large acute hospital. Both training datasets and validation datasets will be analyzed to assess the degree of correspondence between the vital sign measurements predicted by the Lifelight software and the direct physiological measurements taken using standard of care methods. Subgroup analyses will explore how the performance of the algorithm varies with particular patient characteristics, including age, sex, health condition, and medication. Results: Recruitment of participants to this study began in July 2018, and data collection will continue for a planned study period of 12 months. Conclusions: Digital health technology is a rapidly evolving area for health and social care. Following this initial exploratory study to develop and refine the Lifelight software application, subsequent work will evaluate its performance across a range of health characteristics, and extended validation trials will support its pathway to registration as a medical device. Innovations in health technology such as this may provide valuable opportunities for increasing the efficiency and accessibility of vital sign measurements and improve health care services on a large scale across multiple health and care settings. © Thomas L Jones, Emily Heiden, Felicity Mitchell, Carole Fogg, Sharon McCready, Laurence Pearce, Melissa Kapoor, Paul Bassett, Anoop J Chauhan.

AB  - Introduction: Atrial Fibrillation (AF), the most commonly sustained arrhythmia, affects approximately 200,000 Canadians and costs an annual $815 million to the Ontario provincial healthcare system. The current model for chronic AF management (favouring infrequent hospital visits) in combination with the challenge of detecting cardiac arrythmias provides opportunity for wearable devices to improve quality of care. Physicians must be aware of available wearable devices, their accuracy, validity, and potential to improve patient care. Methods: PubMed and Google Scholar databases were searched for primary studies involving AF and wearable devices published from database inception to 2020. Due to the heterogeneity of the findings, quantitative synthesis of the information could not be conducted. A narrative synthesis was performed for the obtained results, including a discussion of apparent trends and common study outcome measures: sensitivity, specificity, positive-, and negative-predictive-values. The narrative included comparisons to similar reviews and a discussion on both the current and future research directions. Results: The systematic search produced 214 studies, of which, 7 met the pre-determined eligibility criteria. The studies were published between 2018-2020 in 5 countries. Each eligible study was described and summarized; devices investigated include the Apple Watch with Kardia Band (Atrial fibrillation-sensing watch; AFSW), Huawei wearable devices (Honor 4 wristband, Honor Watch or Watch GT), CardioTracker (CART) + a pulse oximeter, and the RITMA system. Discussion: This systematic review comprehensively examined wearable devices used to deliver care for patients with AF. It was found that currently available wearable technologies for AF detection and management varied greatly in their accuracy, application settings, and accessibility. With technological advancements and further exploration into AF devices’ usability, widespread implementation of wearable technology in AF care is plausible. Successful application of these technologies can improve AF care and contribute to a significant reduction in AF-related healthcare costs. Conclusion: There are many devices available for AF care that show promise for certain applications. Additionally, there remains a demand for large-scale, high-quality research in this field to investigate the advantages and shortcomings of various devices that have shown promise in preliminary research. Future research should focus on randomized controlled trials to generate conclusive findings for wearable technologies in AF. © Ervis Musa, Adam Z. Levitan, Gavin Hughes. (2021).
