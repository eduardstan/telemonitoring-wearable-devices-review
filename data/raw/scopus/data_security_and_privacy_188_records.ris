AB  - Wearable sweat sensors are reshaping healthcare monitoring, providing real-time data on hydration and electrolyte levels with user-friendly, noninvasive devices. This paper introduces a highly portable two-channel microfluidic device for simultaneous sweat sampling and the real-time detection of volatile organic compound (VOC) biomarkers. This innovative wearable microfluidic system is tailored for monitoring diabetes through the continuous and noninvasive tracking of acetone and ammonia VOCs, and it seamlessly integrates with smartphones for easy data management. The core of this system lies in the utilization of carbon polymer dots (CPDs) and carbon dots (CDs) derived from monomers such as catechol, resorcinol, o-phenylenediamine, urea, and citric acid. These dots are seamlessly integrated into hydrogels made from gelatin and poly(vinyl alcohol), resulting in an advanced solid-state fluorometric sensor coating on a cellulose paper substrate. These sensors exhibit exceptional performance, offering linear detection ranges of 0.05-0.15 ppm for acetone and 0.25-0.37 ppm for ammonia, with notably low detection limits of 0.01 and 0.08 ppm, respectively. Rigorous optimization of operational parameters, encompassing the temperature, sample volume, and assay time, has been undertaken to maximize device performance. Furthermore, these sensors demonstrate impressive selectivity, effectively discerning between biologically similar substances and other potential compounds commonly present in sweat. As this field matures, the prospect of cost-effective, continuous, personalized health monitoring through wearable VOC sensors holds significant potential for overcoming barriers to comprehensive medical care in underserved regions. This highlights the transformative capacity of wearable VOC sweat sensing in ensuring equitable access to advanced healthcare diagnostics, particularly in remote or geographically isolated areas. © 2024 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has emerged as a paradigm shift in healthcare, integrating the Internet of Things (IoT) with medical devices, sensors, and healthcare systems. From peripheral devices that monitor vital signs to remote patient monitoring systems and smart hospitals, IoMT provides a vast array of applications that empower healthcare professionals. However, the integration of IoMT presents numerous obstacles, such as data security, privacy concerns, interoperability, scalability, and ethical considerations. For the successful integration and deployment of IoMT, addressing these obstacles is essential. Federated Learning (FL) permits collaborative model training while maintaining data privacy in distributed environments like IoMT. By incorporating Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, the resulting models become more interpretable and transparent, enabling healthcare professionals to comprehend the underlying decision-making processes. This integration not only improves the credibility of Artificial Intelligence models but also facilitates the detection of biases, errors, and peculiar patterns in the data. The combination of FL and XAI contributes to the development of more privacy-preserving, trustworthy, and explainable AI systems, which are essential for the development of dependable and ethically sound IoMT applications. Hence, the aim of this paper is to conduct a literature review on the amalgamation of FL and XAI for IoMT. © 2024 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - The technical advancements in Mobile communication and the possibility of networking physical devices have made a great impact on the development of real-time monitoring and control applications across various fields. There is a rising demand for online monitoring of the health factors of a patient, who is staying at a remote location and elders suffering from health issues and not able to travel to the hospital. Safeguarding the privacy of the patient data is a paramount challenge while observing patient health conditions through IoT. We have introduced a Real-Time Distant Healthcare Monitoring IoT System (RTDHMIS) which protects the patient data using a lightweight block cipher BEST -1 (Better Encryption Security Technique-1). Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN) comprise many sensor nodes, which are implanted in the patient's body for data collection. Since wearable sensor nodes are resource-constrained devices, it is essential to use a lightweight cryptographic algorithm for data protection. The block cipher BEST -1 provides a good security mechanism against many known security attacks. The security and efficiency of the newly introduced system are compared with related systems and it is found that the performance of RTDHMIS is better for implementation in a healthcare environment.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Mobile health (mHealth) has recently had significant advances in tele-dermatology (TD) thanks to the developments following the COVID-19 pandemic. This topic is very important, as telemedicine and mHealth, when applied to dermatology, could improve both the quality of healthcare for citizens and the workflow in the health domain. The proposed study was centered on the last three years. We conducted an overview on the opportunities, the perspectives, and the problems involved in TD integration with mHealth. The methodology of the narrative review was based on: (I) a search of PubMed and Scopus and (II) an eligibility assessment, using properly proposed parameters. The outcome of the study showed that during the COVID-19 pandemic, TD integration with mHealth advanced rapidly. This integration enabled the monitoring of dermatological problems and facilitated remote specialist visits, reducing face-to-face interactions. AI and mobile apps have empowered citizens to take an active role in their healthcare. This differs from other imaging sectors where information exchange is limited to professionals. The opportunities for TD in mHealth include improving service quality, streamlining healthcare processes, reducing costs, and providing more accessible care. It can be applied to various conditions, such as (but not limited to) acne, vitiligo, psoriasis, and skin cancers. Integration with AI and augmented reality (AR), as well as the use of wearable sensors, are anticipated as future developments. However, integrating TD with mHealth also brings about problems and challenges related to regulations, ethics, cybersecurity, data privacy, and device management. Scholars and policymakers need to address these issues while involving citizens in the process. © 2023 by the author.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) gains myriad admiration in wide applications including medical and healthcare monitoring due to its low cost and its self-operating activities. Recently several wearable gadgets are used frequently and become popular in health monitoring systems. In the monitoring system, Biomedical Sensor Nodes (BSN) are used to sense the physiological parameters of the patients and transmitted to the coordinator or Base Station (BS) via the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) frameworks for further analysis. BSNs are energy-constrained and the most amount of energy is consumed due to their information transmissions. Therefore, a key research problem is to reduce energy consumption and communication costs. Moreover, patient data, transmitted over the insecure channel may lead to security threats. Therefore, ensuring data privacy and integrity is another challenging issue. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient and secure health monitoring system to reduce the energy consumption and communication cost of the monitoring system. On the other hand, it also provides secured data transmission by incorporating a Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) based lightweight security mechanism. Extensive simulation results reveal that the proposed scheme achieved improved performance in terms of network lifetime by 27%, average End-to-end delay by 18%, and average network throughput by 23%. In conclusion, our proposed algorithms prove to be a feasible solution for securing and extending the IoMT network lifetime. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The healthcare industry has undergone revolutionary changes as technology has advanced in recent years. The Internet of Things, Cloud Computing, Blockchain technology, lab-on-a-chip, non-invasive and minimally invasive operations, and other advancements have made it easier to treat a variety of debilitating ailments These new technologies have had a significant impact on both research and the healthcare business. Miniaturized healthcare sensors powered by IoT can be used for clinical tests and self-health tracking. They aid professionals in remote regions in making early diagnoses and treatment recommendations without having direct contact with users. Access control mechanisms and uneven security rules have made it difficult to meet the data's security standards. The patient's vital signs can be monitored using blockchain-based smart contracts and an enterprise-distributed ledger infrastructure. This offers global access to patient medical information at any moment, as well as an immutable and thorough history log. When compared to existing patient monitoring systems, the proposed approach provides more benefits. The blockchain system provides greater monitoring, increased connectivity, and higher data security when compared to traditional patient monitoring systems. Despite the abundance of medical facilities, fatal diseases such as heart disease, cancer, influenza, and pneumonia have increased significantly and claim many lives. A large number of doctors, therapists, nurses, and other personnel constantly monitor and observe patients' health. Patients with chronic diseases are regularly monitored and observed. In recent years, various healthcare monitoring systems have been introduced, and they are used to collect, process, and analyze data retrieved from sensing devices. These healthcare systems are also responsible for tracking and monitoring patients' vital signs. However, when connecting different departments of a hospital in order to effectively share medical data to provide better healthcare services to patients, the issue of legal interoperability arises. No such thing as a centralized system exists. A blockchain can address these problems using its decentralized architecture. Blockchain technology can be used to make his or her medical records unalterable and immutable. Any access or adjustment effort may be instantly labeled and identified across the blockchain. This is useful not just for patient integrity, but it also identifies any criminal activities, such as wholesale fraud or record adulteration. Furthermore, approved medicinal service record sharing and review will be greatly simplified. When a patient comes in, the majority of the patient's suppliers are usually notified immediately. Medication bugs, hypersensitivities, and drug solutions can be accommodated in overall blockchain records relatively quickly using appropriate patient-caring algorithms, removing the need for time-consuming pharmaceutical compromise forms. The use of blockchain technology will thus encourage improved access to care, medical record management, prompt clinical information confirmation, increased security, and more effective care planning for the effective delivery of healthcare services to patients through the management and sharing of medical data. Blockchain is transforming traditional healthcare practices into a more reliable means of effective diagnosis and treatment through safe and secure data sharing. In the future, blockchain could be a technology that can help with personalized, authentic, and secure healthcare by combining all of a patient's real-time clinical data and presenting it in an up-to-date secure healthcare setup. © 2023 River Publishers.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is recently seeing significant advances in teledermatology (TD), also thanks to the developments that have taken place during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the last two years, there was an important development of studies that focused on opportunities, perspectives, and problems in this field. The topic is very important because the telemedicine and AI applied to dermatology have the opportunity to improve both the quality of healthcare for citizens and the workflow of healthcare professionals. This study conducted an overview on the opportunities, the perspectives, and the problems related to the integration of TD with AI. The methodology of this review, following a standardized checklist, was based on: (I) a search of PubMed and Scopus and (II) an eligibility assessment, using parameters with five levels of score. The outcome highlighted that applications of this integration have been identified in various skin pathologies and in quality control, both in eHealth and mHealth. Many of these applications are based on Apps used by citizens in mHealth for self-care with new opportunities but also open questions. A generalized enthusiasm has been registered regarding the opportunities and general perspectives on improving the quality of care, optimizing the healthcare processes, minimizing costs, reducing the stress in the healthcare facilities, and in making citizens, now at the center, more satisfied. However, critical issues have emerged related to: (a) the need to improve the process of diffusion of the Apps in the hands of citizens, with better design, validation, standardization, and cybersecurity; (b) the need for better attention paid to medico-legal and ethical issues; and (c) the need for the stabilization of international and national regulations. Targeted agreement initiatives, such as position statements, guidelines, and/or consensus initiatives, are needed to ensure a better result for all, along with the design of both specific plans and shared workflows. © 2023 by the author.

AB  - Background: Telehealth can improve the treatment of chronic disorders, such as epilepsy. Telehealth prevalence and use increased during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, familiarity with and use of telehealth and health-related mobile applications (apps) by persons with epilepsy remain unknown. Methods: We investigated telehealth use, demographics, and clinical variables within the multicenter Epi2020 cross-sectional study. Between October and December 2020, adults with epilepsy completed a validated questionnaire, including individual questions regarding knowledge and use of apps and telehealth. Results: Of 476 included individuals (58.2% women; mean age 40.2 ± 15.4 years), 41.6% reported using health-related apps. Health apps were used more frequently (pedometer 32.1%, exercise app 17.6%) than medical apps (health insurance 15.1%, menstrual apps 12.2%) or apps designed for epilepsy (medication reminders 10.3%, seizure calendars 4.6%). Few used seizure detectors (i.e., apps as medical devices 1.9%) or mobile health devices (fitness bracelet 11.3%). A majority (60.9%) had heard the term telehealth, 78.6% of whom had a positive view. However, only 28.6% had a concrete idea of telehealth, and only 16.6% reported personal experience with telehealth. A majority (55%) would attend a teleconsultation follow-up, and 41.2% would in a medical emergency. Data privacy and availability were considered equally important by 50.8%, 21.8% considered data privacy more important, and 20.2% considered data availability more important. Current health-related app use was independently associated with younger age (p = 0.003), higher education (p < 0.001), and subjective COVID-19-related challenges (p = 0.002). Persistent seizure occurrence (vs. seizure freedom ≥12 months) did not affect willingness to use teleconsultations on multivariable logistic regression analysis. Conclusions: Despite positive telehealth views, few persons with epilepsy in Germany are familiar with specific apps or services. Socioeconomic factors influence telehealth use more than baseline epilepsy characteristics. Telehealth education and services should target socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals to reduce the digital care gap.

AB  - The exponential growth of produced data by healthcare monitoring devices poses a substantial challenge for conventional fog-based computing frameworks. Fog computing, a dispersed computing prototype that expands fog computing capabilities to the network's edge, emerges as a promising solution to address this challenge. This paper, proposes a technique for offloading computations for healthcare monitoring in fog computing, aiming to minimize task completion time, consumption of energy, execution time ratio and response time analysis. Enhancing Healthcare Monitoring with Optimal Computation Offloading in Fog Environment specifies that the research is focused on improving healthcare monitoring systems through the use of fog computing. In this approach, data processing is carried out closer to the source, such as medical devices or sensors, instead of depending only on centralized cloud servers. The "computation offloading" technique is moving computational workloads from less powerful devices to edge or fog nodes with more processing power. By using this method, the research seeks to improve real-time data processing, minimize latency, maximize resource use, and improve security in healthcare monitoring by retaining confidential data closer to its source. The goal of the study is to show how this strategy might result in healthcare monitoring systems that are more effective and efficient, especially when quick decisions and great data security are required. The proposed technique dynamically offloads computation tasks to fog nodes based on real-time network conditions, resource availability, and task characteristics. It emphasizes the achievement of superior performance metrics including the shortest job completion time, lowest energy consumption, and minimal cost compared to existing task offloading methods within healthcare contexts. The technique notably achieves a reduction of up to 31.1% in task completion time, 66.67% in energy consumption, and 20% in execution time ratio compared to existing task offloading methods in healthcare contexts. Additionally, it improves response time by 40%, demonstrating superior performance metrics. It conducts a thorough assessment of the proposed technique’s effectiveness through key performance indicators such as Task Completion Time, Energy Consumption, Execution Time Ratio, and Response Time Analysis. Finally, a detailed comparative analysis against established techniques enriches the discussion, providing valuable insights into the superiority of the proposed technique. ©EverScience Publications.

AB  - Long-term remote patients monitoring implies minimal discomfort and reliability throughout the study period. These requirements are fulfilled by portable (wearable) patient devices, with low consumption, which transmit data wirelessly, at a short distance, to a mobile communication device (GSM) and through it, to a remote end recipient - doctor, medical center or a hospital server. The data transfer technology requires the monitored person to perform a sequence of actions, such as: selecting the appropriate application on the mobile phone, establishing a connection between the patient module and the phone, recording the data in the phone's memory, starting the data transfer from the phone to the final receiver. Practice shows that often this sequence of activities is difficult for elderly people and especially for visually impaired people, which as a result compromises the remote monitoring process. In this paper are presented an approach and conceptual implementation of a system for remote monitoring of cardiac activity, using the most popular way of remote connectivity - voice (sound) communication. In addition to the ease of use, this type of communication does not require special data protection, due to the lack of RF interfaces for short-distance data transmission. The presented results of laboratory studies, as well as conducted tests under medical supervision of patients in a cardiology clinic, confirm the workability of the proposed approach for remote monitoring of patients by audio conversion of the ECG signal. © 2023 IOS Press.

AB  - The advancement of the medical equipment and its integration with the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has facilitated the remote monitoring of the health-related information of the patient and its analytics by the expert. IoMT network generates the large amount of medical data that are remotely accessed by the smart hospital, smart ambulance, and doctors for better observation and monitoring of the patient. In recent years, the smart connectivity of IoMT devices faces various known and unknown malware threats. To protect the IoMT system, there is a need to device an intelligent malware detection system for IoMT network. Thus, this paper proposes a hybrid Deep learning model by integrating the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Iterative Neighbourhood Component Analysis (INCA), for malware detection and identification task, named as (CNN-INCA-MD). The proposed model is evaluated on IoT malware dataset and achieved an accuracy of 96.98% with precision of 96.68%, recall of 96.67% and f1score of 96.66%. The proposed model is robust in detecting malware and outperforms from existing models. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

The healthcare and research fields have been substantially impacted by emerging technologies. On the other hand, there are legitimate worries regarding the security of data transfers and transaction recording upon using these technologies. Healthcare departments need easy data interchange for interoperability. Protecting data security and integrity is crucial when exchanging information with authorized parties. In many existing solutions, patients’ sensitive data is collected and stored in smart healthcare systems. Scalability, breach or unauthorized access to this data can compromise privacy. The adoption of blockchain technology is one way to safeguard patient privacy in healthcare. Also, by facilitating the safe and secure exchange of data, blockchain technology is revolutionizing the healthcare industry by making traditional methods of diagnosis and treatment more reliable. However, blockchain has serious problems with its highly limited scalability. This article suggests a new method “SHORTBLOCKS” depending on blockchain technology for the safe administration and analysis of data. To circumvent the security-scalability issue and achieve high throughput, this study employs the newly introduced protocol “SHORTBLOCKS”, which extends blockchain concept to a direct acyclic graph of blocks. The proposed system uses both a private and a public blockchain that are created on the new protocol. In order to analyze patient health data, a system using smart contracts and a private blockchain is built. The system logs the occurrence to the public blockchain in the case that the smart contract raises an alarm due to an unusual reading. This will fix the scalability issue with initial blockchain as well as the security and privacy issues involved in remote patient monitoring. Simulation results shows the performance of the proposed system by comparing with existing solutions, SPECTRE protocol and GHOSTDAG protocol. © 2024 SCPE.

AB  - Objective: In this study, we aimed to identify the reasons for and perceived challenges associated with the use of digital health technologies (DHT) in cardiology. Method: We distributed an online survey to Turkish Society of Cardiology member cardiologists (n = 2789) between January 10 and March 3, 2022. Results: A total of 308 subjects responded (27.6% females, 62.0% aged 30-44 years). Of these, 42.5% worked at university hospitals, and 44.8% at state hospitals. Smart devices were used by 44.2% (136/308) for personal health monitoring. Additionally, 40.3% (117/290) used social media to provide medical information to patients, while 64.6% (193/299) did so for communication with other physicians. The self-reported recommendation frequencies of wearables, cardiac implantable electronic device telemonitorization, mobile health applications, and teleconsultation/televisit technologies were lower than the proportion of respondents who found DHT beneficial for both patients and physicians. The most frequently mentioned barriers for physicians were increased work burden and responsibilities (78.8%, 193/245), lack of financial compensation (66.9%, 164/245), and lack of relevant training (66.5%, 163/245). For patients, low technological adaptability (81.6%, 200/245), low health literacy (80.4%, 197/245), and low affordability (79.6%, 195/245) were the most frequently mentioned barriers. Additionally, the cost of technologies (69.4%, 170/245), concerns regarding data privacy and security (57.6%, 141/245), and data storage challenges (48.2%, 118/245) were the most significant technical impediments. Conclusion: The findings suggest that although the majority of physicians believe DHT to be beneficial for both themselves and their patients, the frequency of recommendations to patients remains low. A large-scale joint effort is required to address these issues and facilitate the integration of DHT into clinical practice. © 2024 Turkish Society of Cardiology. All rights reserved.

AB  - Healthcare is an emerging sector with the integration of emerging technologies aiming to improve Quality of Life of an individual through various medical services. Most of the healthcare services work with sensitive information of patients either collected in real-time using body implanted sensors or through various IoT enabled medical devices during the diagnosis in a centrally controlled model. But, the traditional IoT based medical services suffer from several challenges such as data security, privacy, interoperability, single point of failure, scalability, and data integrity. However, by considering the advantages of Blockchain technology and the disadvantages of IoT systems, the amalgamation of a decentralised, distributed ledger technology with the IoT for various healthcare applications will strengthen the system by resolving the major challenges. Thus, this research article conducts a comprehensive survey on the integration of Blockchain and IoT (BCIoT) for Healthcare services, focusing mainly on existing approaches, possibilities, applications and challenges. First, we present a detailed overview of Blockchain, IoT and the motivation for BCIoT along with the survey on existing healthcare applications. Next we discuss the enabling platforms for BCIoT based healthcare services. For the better understanding, we review the role of BCIoT in Remote patient monitoring, electronic heath record management, Health asset tracing, Covid-19 infected patient contact tracking. Finally challenges and future directions are discussed to improve the Quality of Life of patients through Healthcare applications. © 2023

AB  - Arrhythmia disorders are the leading cause of death worldwide and are primarily recognized by the patient's irregular cardiac rhythms. Wearable Internet of Things (IoT) devices can reliably measure patients' heart rhythms by producing electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Due to their non-invasive nature, ECG signals have been frequently employed to detect arrhythmias. The manual procedure, however, takes a long time and is prone to error. Utilizing deep learning models for early automatic identification of cardiac arrhythmias is a preferable approach that will improve diagnosis and therapy. Though ECG analysis using cloud-based methods can perform satisfactorily, they still suffer from security issues. It is essential to provide secure data transmission and storage for IoT medical data because of its significant development in the healthcare system. So, this paper proposes a secure arrhythmia classification system with the help of effective encryption and a deep learning (DL) system. The proposed method mainly involved two phases: ECG signal transmission and arrhythmia disease classification. In the ECG signal transmission phase, the patient's ECG data collected through the IoT sensors is encrypted using the optimal key-based elgamal elliptic curve cryptography (OKEGECC) mechanism, and the encrypted data is securely transmitted to the cloud. After that, in the arrhythmia disease classification phase, the system collects the data from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology-Beth Israel Hospital (MIT-BIH) database to perform training. The collected data is preprocessed by applying the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to improve the quality of the ECG data. Next, the feature extraction is carried out by deformable attention-centered residual network 50 (DARNet-50), and finally, the classification is performed using butterfly-optimized Bi-directional long short-term memory (BOBLSTM). The experimental outcomes showed that the proposed system achieves 99.76% accuracy, which is better than the existing related schemes.  © 2024 - IOS Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Since the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a boost in the digital transformation of the human society, where wearable devices such as a smartwatch can already measure vital signs in a continuous and naturalistic way; however, the security and privacy of personal data is a challenge to expanding the use of these data by health professionals in clinical follow-up for decision-making. Similar to the European General Data Protection Regulation, in Brazil, the Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados established rules and guidelines for the processing of personal data, including those used for patient care, such as those captured by smartwatches. Thus, in any telemonitoring scenario, there is a need to comply with rules and regulations, making this issue a challenge to overcome. Objective: This study aimed to build a digital solution model for capturing data from wearable devices and making them available in a safe and agile manner for clinical and research use, following current laws. Methods: A functional model was built following the Brazilian Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados (2018), where data captured by smartwatches can be transmitted anonymously over the Internet of Things and be identified later within the hospital. A total of 80 volunteers were selected for a 24-week follow-up clinical trial divided into 2 groups, one group with a previous diagnosis of COVID-19 and a control group without a previous diagnosis of COVID-19, to measure the synchronization rate of the platform with the devices and the accuracy and precision of the smartwatch in out-of-hospital conditions to simulate remote monitoring at home. Results: In a 35-week clinical trial, >11.2 million records were collected with no system downtime; 66% of continuous beats per minute were synchronized within 24 hours (79% within 2 days and 91% within a week). In the limit of agreement analysis, the mean differences in oxygen saturation, diastolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure, and heart rate were -1.280% (SD 5.679%), -1.399 (SD 19.112) mm Hg, -1.536 (SD 24.244) mm Hg, and 0.566 (SD 3.114) beats per minute, respectively. Furthermore, there was no difference in the 2 study groups in terms of data analysis (neither using the smartwatch nor the gold-standard devices), but it is worth mentioning that all volunteers in the COVID-19 group were already cured of the infection and were highly functional in their daily work life. Conclusions: On the basis of the results obtained, considering the validation conditions of accuracy and precision and simulating an extrahospital use environment, the functional model built in this study is capable of capturing data from the smartwatch and anonymously providing it to health care services, where they can be treated according to the legislation and be used to support clinical decisions during remote monitoring. © JMIR Formative Research.All rights reserved.

AB  - In recent decades, telemedicine has revolutionized the healthcare landscape, offering innovative solutions to improve the accessibility and efficiency of medical care. In this context, the Internet of Things (IoT) has played a significant role, facilitating connectivity and data exchange between medical devices and healthcare providers. However, while traditional IoT primarily focuses on local connectivity, the evolution towards the Internet of Remote Medical Things (IoRMT) has opened new frontiers in telemedicine, enabling the monitoring and treatment of patients even in remote or hard-to-reach areas. IoRMT represents an integrated approach that leverages advanced communication and sensing technologies to enable the connection and interaction of remote medical devices with healthcare networks. This interconnected infrastructure allows healthcare professionals to monitor patients in real-time, diagnose medical conditions, and provide personalized care, regardless of their geographical location. Through the adoption of wearable sensors, remote monitoring devices, and teleassistance systems, IoRMT offers a wide range of applications in telemedicine. One of the key areas where IoRMT has demonstrated its potential is in the management of chronic diseases. Patients suffering from conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, or heart disease can benefit from regular monitoring and real-time feedback from their healthcare providers, enabling more effective and proactive management of their health conditions. Additionally, IoRMT facilitates the delivery of specialized care in remote areas where access to healthcare services is limited. However, the implementation of IoRMT in telemedicine presents significant challenges, including data security, patient privacy, and the quality of network connections in remote areas. It is crucial to address these challenges through the implementation of advanced security protocols, compliance with data privacy regulations, and optimization of communication infrastructures. In conclusion, the Internet of Remote Medical Things represents a significant evolution in telemedicine, offering innovative solutions to improve the accessibility, efficiency, and quality of remote medical care. Through the integration of advanced technologies and clinical practices, IoRMT has the potential to radically transform the way healthcare is delivered and received worldwide, contributing to the improvement of health and well-being in global communities. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - In many developing countries, the healthcare sector is facing several challenges, mainly due to the lack of personal, institutions, and medications in public health systems. Over the past decade, information and communication technology has proved its ability to improve medical quality, reduce costs, and promote data security. Developing countries can exploit these technologies to improve the healthcare process and ensure remote health monitoring, especially in rural areas. The Internet of Things and smart medical devices are widely used to provide remote patient monitoring. Current systems are based on centralized communication with cloud servers. However, this architecture increases several security and privacy risks. The adoption of a distributed architecture is required to overcome these issues. In this article, we describe a Blockchain-based system for securing Internet-of-Things (IoT) healthcare devices. In addition to data encryption, we propose to use Blockchain technology to enhance security and privacy in healthcare systems. The system is intended to allow remote patient monitoring, particularly for chronic diseases that necessitate regular monitoring. Three important characteristics were taken into account: security, scalability, and processing time. The security concerns are ensured by using the re-encryption proxy in conjunction with Blockchain to encrypt data and control access to it. To ensure Blockchain scalability, data are stored in an InterPlanetary file system (IPFS) off-chain database. We use an Ethereum Blockchain based on proof of authority (PoA) to speed up the data storage. In comparison to existing methods, the experimental system has shown a significant improvement in the security of healthcare systems. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - In this era of increased technological and medical advancements, remote monitoring of patients and elderly people has become more popular. Even in situations like the Covid'19 pandemic, the hospital and medical facilities are in demand. In such scenarios, elderly people who need medical care and patients who need round-the-clock medical attention can be made to stay in their homes and can be monitored remotely with the help of a remote patient monitoring system. Such a system can be built by incorporating Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN). WBAN encompasses various biological wearable sensors which monitor the patient’s health around the clock. The accumulated sensor data is then shared with hospitals and medical professionals through wireless sensor networks. This data includes personnel details, various vital parameters, medical images, etc. which are highly confidential. So providing security and confidentiality in such networks is mandatory. Several cryptographic mechanisms and algorithms are available for ensuring security in WBANs. In recent days several works have been proposed to incorporate the emerging Blockchain technology to improve the privacy, security, and confidentiality in WBANs. In this survey, we discuss various research that proposed blockchain-based solutions for ensuring security, integrity, and data privacy in WBAN. © 2024 IETE.

AB  - The patient health monitoring approach based on the Internet of Things (IoT) consists of smart electronic devices and protocol that communicate to the data via the internet. The medical field now has countless new avenues to explore because of this discovery. Health information and additional symptom information can be gathered by associated smart sensors. This allows the patient to reach the right healthcare specialist, thus facilitating distant care. However, there are concerns about hacking and confidentiality of medical data in IoT platforms. As a result, it is crucial to develop specific safety protocols for IoT-based patient health monitoring system. Researchers periodically propose a new strategy for protecting data collected by IoT-based healthcare devices. The data can be vulnerable to numerous forms of attacks. Thus, the researchers proposed the notion of enhancing the security of the IoT-based patient health monitoring system by incorporating blockchain technology. This research study suggests a Blockchain-based XOR Elliptic Curve Cryptography (XORECC) method for securing an IoT healthcare monitoring system against a wide range of possible attacks. The proposed method is evaluated against the traditional approaches like Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA). The experimental findings confirm that the suggested approach provides a very high level of security for data transmission over the IoT.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Remote patient monitoring aspect of Healthcare 4.0 has revolutionized the way we pursue medical treatment. Integration of Medical Internet of Things (MIoT), patient centric healthcare devices and remote robotic equipment has vanished the separative line between physical onsite monitoring and remote monitoring. Secure use of available network to handle this critical patient data is one of the major concern raised due to this methodology. To mitigate this paramount concern Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can be utilized to detect in malicious activity or manipulation occurred on incoming data. Though use of ML algorithms along with conventional feature extraction technique brings performance saturation challenge and creates a black-box in this highly complex communication environment. To overcome this drawback, we propose X-NET, an eXplainable Artificial Intelligent (X-AI) based network data security approach for Healthcare 4.0 applications. For comparison purpose we have used five different types of tradition feature extraction techniques along with Naive Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (LR) and Perception. Utilization of X-AI algorithms such as LIME and SHAP has significantly boosted the overall performance and reliability of X-NET. Performance evolution of our proposed approach has been done through various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, Receiver Operating Characteristic and Precision-Recall Trade-off. Thus, X-NET contributes in defining secured, reliable and robust remote patient monitoring scheme for Healthcare 4.0. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - IoT has seen remarkable growth, particularly in healthcare, leading to the rise of IoMT. IoMT integrates medical devices for real-time data analysis and transmission but faces challenges in data security and interoperability. This research identifies a significant gap in the existing literature regarding a comprehensive ontology for vulnerabilities in medical IoT devices. This paper proposes a fundamental domain ontology named MIoT (Medical Internet of Things) ontology, focusing on cybersecurity in IoMT (Internet of Medical Things), particularly in remote patient monitoring settings. This research will refer to similar-looking acronyms, IoMT and MIoT ontology. It is important to distinguish between the two. IoMT is a collection of various medical devices and their applications within the research domain. On the other hand, MIoT ontology refers to the proposed ontology that defines various concepts, roles, and individuals. MIoT ontology utilizes the knowledge engineering methodology outlined in Ontology Development 101, along with the structured life cycle, and establishes semantic interoperability among medical devices to secure IoMT assets from vulnerabilities and cyberattacks. By defining key concepts and relationships, it becomes easier to understand and analyze the complex network of information within the IoMT. The MIoT ontology captures essential key terms and security-related entities for future extensions. A conceptual model is derived from the MIoT ontology and validated through a case study. Furthermore, this paper outlines a roadmap for future research, highlighting potential impacts on security automation in healthcare applications. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Smart medical devices and the internet of things (IoT) have enhanced healthcare systems by allowing remote monitoring of patient's health. Because of the unexpected increase in the number of diabetes patients, it is critical to regularly evaluate patients' health conditions before any significant illness occurs. As a result of transmitting a large volume of sensitive medical data, dealing with IoT data security issues remains a difficult challenge. This paper presents a secure remote diabetes monitoring (SR-DM) model that uses hybrid encryption, combining the advanced encryption standard and elliptic curve cryptography (AES-ECC), to ensure the patients' sensitive data is protected in IoT platforms based on the cloud. The health statuses of patients are determined in this model by predicting critical situations using machine learning (ML) algorithms for analyzing medical data sensed by smart health IoT devices. The results reveal that the AES-ECC approach has a significant influence on cloud-based IoT systems and the random forest (RF) classification method outperforms with a high accuracy of 91.4%. As a consequence of the outcomes obtained, the proposed model effectively establishes a secure and efficient system for remote health monitoring. © 2024 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

AB  - The fusion of Internet of Things (IoT) technology into healthcare, known as the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), has significantly enhanced medical treatment and operational efficiency. Real-time patient monitoring (RPM) and remote diagnostics enabled by IoMT allow doctors to treat more patients effectively and save lives. However, healthcare devices' interconnected nature makes them vulnerable to cyber-attacks, threatening patient privacy and security. Ensuring the security and accuracy of patient health data is paramount, as any tampering could have life-threatening consequences, especially in emergency situations. To address these challenges, this research focuses on developing robust security models to secure patient data in IoMT networks while meeting the growing demand for efficient healthcare services. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have the potential to be employed as the methodology for intrusion detection. The goal of this research is threefold: firstly, the linear support vector machine (LinSVM) model; secondly, the convolutional support vector machine (ConvSVM) model; and finally, the categorical embedding (CatEmb) model, which have been proposed to overcome the issue of security in a network. This article offers the CatEmb model as the first effort to use a DL-based embedding approach to recognize intrusion in the IoMT environment, utilizing patient biometric and network traffic flow data. Our experimental results show the efficacy of the proposed DL models, with the LinSVM achieving a training accuracy of 99.78%, ConvSVM reaching 99.98%, and CatEmb achieving 99.84%. These models outperform existing methodologies by 2.61% in detecting network intrusions, as demonstrated through metrics such as detection rate and F1-score. Furthermore, the proposed approaches are thoroughly compared with the existing state-of-the-art studies. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - Importance: Just-in-time interventions (JITIs) are a type of digital therapeutic intervention that combines remote monitoring tools and algorithms to personalize the delivery of specific interventions at the right time. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory approval documents are often the only available source of information on the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions based on these devices. Objective: To systematically review the publicly available information from the FDA on all recently approved medical devices used in JITIs to (1) assess how they operate to deliver JITIs and (2) appraise the evidence supporting their performance and clinical effectiveness. Evidence Review: Two reviewers systematically searched the Premarket Notifications (510(k)), Premarket Approvals, De Novo, and Humanitarian Device Exemption databases from January 2019 to December 2021 for all entries associated with devices that monitored patients' data over time to personalize the delivery of interventions to treat, prevent, or mitigate health conditions or events. They assessed whether the product summaries (1) enabled an understanding of how the device operated to deliver a JITI (eg, the nature, type, and frequency of the monitoring, the nature of the decision algorithm, and the nature and intended receiver of the intervention); (2) informed about the performance and effectiveness of the JITI; and (3) included information on data security and ownership. Findings: In total, 38 devices were included in this review. These were mainly intended for cardiac conditions (12 [31.6%]), diabetes (10 [26.3%]), and neurological diseases (4 [10.5%]). Monitoring devices ranged from wearable (18 of 28 [64.4%]; eg, smartwatches) to implanted sensors (6 of 28 [21.4%]; eg, inserted electrocardiographic sensors). Only 10 of 38 product summaries (26.3%) allowed a full understanding of how the device operated to deliver a JITI. Similarly, only 12 of 28 (42.9%), 12 of 36 (33.3%), and 5 of 38 (13.2%) reported the assessment of the performance of the monitoring device, assessment of the decision algorithm, and results of clinical studies assessing the effectiveness of the JITI, respectively. Finally, 14 of 36 product summaries (38.9%) included some information on data security, but none included information on data ownership. Conclusion and Relevance: The results of this systematic review suggest that the information publicly available in the FDA databases on the performance and effectiveness of digital medical devices used in JITIs is heterogeneous.. © 2023 American Medical Association.

AB  - As the burgeoning field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to permeate the fabric of healthcare, particularly in the realms of patient surveillance and telemedicine, a transformative era beckons. This manuscript endeavors to unravel the intricacies of recent AI advancements and their profound implications for reconceptualizing the delivery of medical care. Through the introduction of innovative instruments such as virtual assistant chatbots, wearable monitoring devices, predictive analytic models, personalized treatment regimens, and automated appointment systems, AI is not only amplifying the quality of care but also empowering patients and fostering a more interactive dynamic between the patient and the healthcare provider. Yet, this progressive infiltration of AI into the healthcare sphere grapples with a plethora of challenges hitherto unseen. The exigent issues of data security and privacy, the specter of algorithmic bias, the requisite adaptability of regulatory frameworks, and the matter of patient acceptance and trust in AI solutions demand immediate and thoughtful resolution.The importance of establishing stringent and far-reaching policies, ensuring technological impartiality, and cultivating patient confidence is paramount to ensure that AI-driven enhancements in healthcare service provision remain both ethically sound and efficient. In conclusion, we advocate for an expansion of research efforts aimed at navigating the ethical complexities inherent to a technology-evolving landscape, catalyzing policy innovation, and devising AI applications that are not only clinically effective but also earn the trust of the patient populace. By melding expertise across disciplines, we stand at the threshold of an era wherein AI's role in healthcare is both ethically unimpeachable and conducive to elevating the global health quotient. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - The dynamic connectivity and functionality of sensors has revolutionized remote monitoring applications thanks to the combination of IoT and wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Wearable wireless medical sensor nodes allow continuous monitoring by amassing physiological data, which is very useful in healthcare applications. These text data are then sent to doctors via IoT devices so they can make an accurate diagnosis as soon as possible. However, the transmission of medical text data is extremely vulnerable to security and privacy assaults due to the open nature of the underlying communication medium. Therefore, a certificate-less aggregation-based signature system has been proposed as a solution to the issue by using elliptic curve public key cryptography (ECC) which allows for a highly effective technique. The cost of computing has been reduced by 93% due to the incorporation of aggregation technology. The communication cost is 400 bits which is a significant reduction when compared with its counterparts. The results of the security analysis show that the scheme is robust against forging, tampering, and man-in-the-middle attacks. The primary innovation is that the time required for signature verification can be reduced by using point addition and aggregation. In addition, it does away with the reliance on a centralized medical server in order to do verification. By taking a distributed approach, it is able to fully preserve user privacy, proving its superiority. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - In modern healthcare systems, medical devices are playing a major role which involves personalized medical devices which improve the patient's lifestyle as they can be remotely monitored and their data are transmissible. Due to these data transmissions, the number of connections to the existing computer networks is increased. Being interoperable and interconnected these personalized medical devices provide great benefits like improved sensing capabilities and actuating capabilities. But the problem with high connectivity computer networks is that it exposes medical device to high cybersecurity vulnerabilities. The main targets are the pacemakers and institutions like hospitals and clinics. Hackers can easily hack medical devices and change prescriptions. So a cybersecurity breach can leak a patient's sensitive and confidential data and risk the patient's life. To prevent these multifaceted problems from happening these problems must be viewed from a systematic perspective and requires governance, technical controls, regulation, and standards.

AB  - Categorizing Artificial Intelligence of Medical Things (AIoMT) devices within the realm of standard Internet of Things (IoT) and Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices, particularly at the server and computational layers, poses a formidable challenge. In this paper, we present a novel methodology for categorizing AIoMT devices through the application of decentralized processing, referred to as "Federated Learning" (FL). Our approach involves deploying a system on standard IoT devices and labeled IoMT devices for training purposes and attribute extraction. Through this process, we extract and map the interconnected attributes from a global federated cum aggression server. The aim of this terminology is to extract interdependent devices via federated learning, ensuring data privacy and adherence to operational policies. Consequently, a global training dataset repository is coordinated to establish a centralized indexing and synchronization knowledge repository. The categorization process employs generic labels for devices transmitting medical data through regular communication channels. We evaluate our proposed methodology across a variety of IoT, IoMT, and AIoMT devices, demonstrating effective classification and labeling. Our technique yields a reliable categorization index for facilitating efficient access and optimization of medical devices within global servers. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - The advancement in automation and medical care technologies in recent decade has changed the traditional medical treatment of patients. Although, these technologies have increased the treatment's precision but the growing number and the complexity of IoT healthcare devices are impacting accuracy along with several other challenges. Moreover, the use of different programming languages, operating platforms and data management methodologies are creating restrictions in safe exchange, integration and reuse of information across different applications. However, with the advent of the semantic web, the semantic technologies are growing in healthcare systems due to the capability of machine interpretation and processing by overcoming the restriction of languages and data heterogeneity. The most common shortcoming in the existing systems are the context-awareness and quality of services and the absence of rich patient ontology; leading towards low accuracy of results. To this aim, this paper provides a smart health framework, consisting on the collection and processing of IoT data (related to patient conditions and context). The framework is supported by the patient ontology along with SWRL rules for better decision making that consider different features (context-awareness and quality of services) differently that results in the improved accuracy. In the evaluation process the proposed work has achieved an accuracy of 89.81%. This work will help the practitioners to treat the patients in a better way.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has created a wide range of opportunities for knowledge exchange in numerous industries. The opportunities include patient empowerment, healthcare collaboration, medical education and training, remote monitoring and telemedicine, customized treatment plans, data sharing for innovation, continuous medical learning, supply chain management, public health initiatives, wearable health devices, and quality improvement initiatives. However, the adoption of IoMT faces numerous challenges regarding interoperability, data privacy, security, regulatory, and infrastructure costs. This paper aims to address the implications of data fusion in IoMT, as well as the associated security challenges and their potential solutions, which are lacking in the literature. Data collected from IoMT devices has a direct impact on the accuracy of predictions because of its quality, quantity, and relevance. With an accuracy of 99.53 % to 99.99 %, the Epilepsy seizure detector-based Naive Bayes (ESDNB) algorithm is found to be the most effective for detecting epileptic seizures in IoMT networks. However, the way data are stored must also undergo a major revolution, and all phases—collection, protection, and storage—need to be improved. The standardization of architecture and security measures may improve the detection of security threats and compromises. Methods to detect malware in cross platforms is also an avenue for future research that can effectively tackle the heterogeneity of the IoMT systems. Cryptography and blockchain technology have shown to be promising ways to increase the security of an IoMT-based system. The findings of this review will assist a wide variety of stakeholders in the healthcare ecosystem. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - The Internet of Things(IoT) can transfer data between the sensor node and the cloud server with the Internet's help for various automated tasks like remote monitoring and controlling. IoT has various applications in different sections, including healthcare, also called the Internet of Medical Things(IoMT). IoT used in healthcare applications can collect patient's biomedical data through medical sensors, which is sent to the cloud server with the help of the Internet. IoT/IoMT systems are having serious challenging concerns such as data security and IoT device's security. Hence, this paper proposes a Physically Unclonable Function(PUF) based lightweight mutual authentication and key agreement protocol for IoT/IoMT devices. A lightweight AEAD cipher, ASCON, and a PUF are used for mutual authentication and key agreement between the IoT/IoMT device and the server. The agreed key is used for encrypting the sensor node data using ASCON cipher. The protocol is implemented in Artix-7 FPGA, and the formal verification is performed using the automated tool Proverif. The proposed protocol takes 912 bits of communication cost, which is 13% less compared to the best existing protocol. Further, the protocol requires a node storage cost of 128 bits, which is only 66% of the best existing protocol.  © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) can be used to support the remote monitoring of patients using communication and sensing technologies. Security and privacy concerns in IoMT related to patient data are important issues for regulatory bodies, requiring the formulating and implementing laws that protect patients. The European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) provides a number of data protection rules that make it easier for citizens to know how their information is being used by external data processors. Citizens can raise complaints to the relevant legal authorities in case of a violation. GDPR Art. 5 imposes lawfulness, fairness, and transparency of data access as requirements that need to be met by a data processor. Medical data is sensitive and the existing healthcare ecosystem often lacks a secure architecture, that can lead to potential data breaches with consequences for both patients and healthcare providers. In this chapter, a multi-layered blockchain-based GDPR compliance verification technique is outlined as a solution for carrying out a privacy audit on how a patient's data has been handled. The multi-layer architecture includes medical sensors, gateways, edge devices, and cloud systems that need to work collectively to offer efficient and secure services to patients. To verify GDPR compliance, a blockchain-based provenance log is integrated with edge devices and cloud systems. A blockchain can be used to record various data activities at the different layers specified above and can be used to verify GDPR compliance. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2024.

This transition is underscored by user-centric interfaces and applications, enabling convenient remote monitoring. However, the escalating concern of patient data vulnerability to network breaches presents a substantial impediment. In response, we introduce the proposed scheme that harnesses Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques. The main objective of the proposed scheme is to meet the exacting requirements of healthcare systems, aiming to fortify data integrity and confidentiality. Within this context, the proposed scheme unveils a sophisticated DL-driven detection model, adeptly tailored for discerning and countering data manipulation endeavors through a nuanced multi-label classification paradigm. Notably, the emphasis lies on safeguarding patient data privacy and security, which is paramount in today's information-rich landscape.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) and cyber-physical systems demand proper real-time data processing and analysis to fulfill the essential characteristics of seamless computing services such as less processing time, dynamic network management, and location awareness. With the evolution of mobile edge computing, numerous security and privacy issues have been addressed including policy management, authentication, access control, and confidentiality. The technologies such as big-data, Internet of Things, and cloud have improved the development of modern healthcare systems to improve the quality of medical services. It is nowadays integrating the computing methods and communication technologies such as wireless sensor networks, radio frequency identification, smartphones, and location awareness to collect and analyze the physiological data of the patient. The e-Health entities such as medical device, client, and server rely on analytical models to carry out early diagnosis and remote monitoring. As it is based on e-Health applications, a real-time healthcare system is preferred to integrate with mobile cloud computing. Since the medical data are hugely exposed to vulnerabilities, a lightweight privacy-aware secure authentication (LPASA) scheme is presented. To achieve better secure efficiencies, this article is preferable to use lightweight cryptographic operations, namely, one-way hashing function and bitwise exclusive-OR. Moreover, the formal and informal security analysis shows that the proposed LPASA can withstand the possible active and passive attacks such as replay, man-in-the-middle, privileged-insider, online-guessing, and so forth. The experimental analysis demonstrates that the proposed LPASA scheme achieves a better quality of services in terms of packet delivery ratio, energy consumption per data delivery bit, and percentage of packets with low latency to adopt in resource-constrained environments. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Globally, cardiovascular disorders, including Atrial Fibrillation (AF), are a major health issue. Telemedicine and cloud-based neural networks are used to improve heart disease diagnosis and monitoring for AF patients in this research. Our technique uses remote patient monitoring and AI to improve AF diagnosis, treatment, and management. This paper develops a cloud-integrated neural network model to interpret real-time patient electrocardiogram (ECG) data. The neural network is trained on a broad dataset to detect modest AF start or progression patterns. Scalable, accessible, and effective data management is achieved using cloud computing. Telemedicine is crucial to this framework since it allows patients to be monitored remotely. Healthcare practitioners get notifications for abnormal ECG patterns, allowing quick intervention and individualized treatment. Patient data is safely saved in the cloud for long-term analysis and population-level AF research. The suggested telemedicine method improves AF event detection accuracy, according to preliminary data. Cloud-based neural networks improve diagnostics and enable healthcare research and information exchange. The system advances cardiac disease management, emphasizing AF, using integration and technology. This research may improve patient outcomes, lower healthcare costs, and increase population-level cardiovascular health knowledge. Teleconsultations maintain patient care while protecting sensitive health data. The system's flexibility and learning increase diagnostic accuracy.  © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - In healthcare, the use of digital twin (DT) technology has been recognised as essential for enhancing patient care through real-time remote monitoring. However, concerns regarding risk prediction, task offloading, and data security have been raised due to the integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) in remote healthcare. In this study, a new method was introduced, combines edge computing with sophisticated cybersecurity solutions. A vast amount of environmental and physiological data has been gathered, allowing for thorough understanding of patients. The system included hybrid encryption, threat prediction, Merkle Tree verification, certificate-based authentication, and secure communication. The feasibility of the proposal was evaluated by using an ESP32-Azure IoT Kit and Azure Cloud to evaluate the system's capacity to securely send patient data to healthcare institutions and stakeholders, while simultaneously upholding data confidentiality. The system demonstrated a notable improvement in encryption speed, with 27.18%, represented as the improved efficiency and achieved storage efficiency ratio 0.673. Furthermore, the evidence from the simulations showed that the system's performance was not affected by encryption since encryption times continuously remained within a narrow range. Moreover, proactive alert of probable security risks would be detected from the predictive analytics, hence strong data integrity assurance. The results suggest the proposed system provided a proactive, personalised care approach for cybersecurity-protected DT healthcare (DTH) high-level modelling and simulation, enabled via IoT and cloud computing under improved threat prediction. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - The usage of IoT in the medical field, often referred to as IoMT, plays a vital role in facilitating the exchange of sensitive data among medical devices. This capability significantly contributes to enhancing the quality of patient care. However, it comes with privacy issues that compromise the security of the data collected by medical sensors, making them vulnerable to potential cyber threats such as data modification, replay attacks, etc. These attacks can lead to significant data loss or unauthorized alterations. Machine learning, particularly in cyber-attack detection systems, is crucial for identifying and classifying such attacks. Yet, the main challenge lies in adapting to the dynamic and unpredictable nature of malicious attacks and creating scalable solutions to combat them. The objective of this paper is to detect cybersecurity threats, with a particular focus on man-in-the-middle attacks that occur within the IoMT communication network. The study utilizes principal component analysis (PCA) for feature reduction and employs multi-layer perceptron to classify unforeseen cyber-attack IoT-based healthcare devices. The study evaluates the effectiveness of this proposed strategy using real-time data from the St. Louis Enhanced Healthcare Monitoring System (WUSTL-EHMS). The findings indicate that the multi-layer perceptron outperforms other tested classifiers, achieving an accuracy score of 96.39%, while also improving the performance by reducing the time complexity. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Chronic diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and cancer pose significant global health challenges, contributing to a substantial portion of worldwide mortality. Diagnosing heart disease, with its diverse signs and symptoms, remains a complex task. The growing market for connected wearable devices presents opportunities for leveraging Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in healthcare. However, diagnosing and managing heart disease effectively remains a critical concern due to its high fatality rates. Integrating IoT into the traditional healthcare system holds promise for enhancing patient outcomes, particularly for those with heart disease. Methods: A Healthcare Monitoring-based IoT framework (HM-IoT) has been developed to enable continuous monitoring of heart disease patients, eliminating the need for manual feature extraction. This framework facilitates real-time monitoring of heart failure patients through IoT-enabled devices. Data encryption using the Enhanced Encryption Standard algorithm ensures the security of patient information within the cloud platform. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model is employed to classify encrypted data, promptly alerting healthcare professionals to abnormal physiological conditions. Results: Evaluation in Matlab revealed impressive processing capabilities, with decryption and encryption rates of 1085 milliseconds and 1075 milliseconds, respectively. Data protection level reached 91%, while the Security Rate level attained 99%. Performance metrics, including Accuracy (98%), Sensitivity (96%), Specificity (98%), and Precision (99.4%), demonstrated the reliability of the system in detecting potential instances of heart disease. Conclusion: The Healthcare Monitoring-based IoT framework represents a significant advancement in smart healthcare solutions for heart disease management. By integrating IoT technologies with healthcare infrastructure, the framework enables real-time monitoring, enhancing prognostic capabilities and facilitating timely interventions. © 2019 ANGIOTHERAPY, a publication of Eman Research Ltd, Australia.

AB  - The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), which integrates medical sensors with the Internet of Things, is helpful for providing remote diagnosis and real-time decision making. Massive data collected by medical and healthcare monitoring sensors in the IoMT involves sensitive patient information. It brings some security challenges to validate the legitimacy of participating entities and protect patient data privacy. A certificateless signcryption (CLSC) scheme combines encryption and signature that can offer authenticity, confidentiality, and unforgeability, providing a viable solution to the data privacy issue of the IoMT. However, existing CLSC schemes fail to meet confidentiality or unforgeability, or require expensive computation overhead to perform pairing operations. This article first presents a new CLSC scheme for secure data transmission and better smart services in IoMT, which replaces the signature part with the Schnorr signature. We then give a thorough security proof under the random oracle model. Besides, we elaborately evaluate the performance and security of some existing solutions with our solution. Finally, the experiment results indicate that our solution can achieve a better balance between security and performance than some existing schemes. Therefore, in terms of feasibility, our scheme is more suitable for the IoMT scenario.  © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Recent advances in smartphones and remote monitoring based on the Internet of Things (IoT) have enabled improved multidimensional intelligent services. The advent of IoT-based wearable and multimedia sensors has prevented millions of mishaps through seamless and systematic monitoring. An IoT-based monitoring system is composed of several sensor devices to measure vital signs, fall detection, energy consumption, and visual recognition. As the data collected by the sensors are transmitted to cloud storage through the Internet, data security is a major concern when transmitting data from remote locations. To improve data security and prediction accuracy, in this study, we proposed a smart and secure multimedia IoT monitoring system for smart homes backed up by smart grid supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA). The proposed system employs state-of-the-art IoT microcontrollers and hardware devices and integrates them in a manner that significantly affects the accuracy and speed of the entire system. Furthermore, the information gathered from IoT is securely transferred through private channels and stored on the cloud, which can be accessed authentically and reliably using an information system built into an IoT application. The output was extensively compared in terms of power consumption and delivery ratio, which were based on the values collected with sequence numbers.

AB  - The current healthcare ecosystem often faces challenges such as data breaches, unauthorized access, data silos, and difficulties in tracking and verifying medical device supply chains. These issues pose a threat to patient confidentiality, trust in healthcare data, and the efficiency of healthcare operations. To address these challenges, a proposed model introduces a unique approach to bolstering the security and efficiency of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in healthcare through the use of advanced cryptographic techniques. Specifically, the model utilizes a heavy computation algorithm known as Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) for packet verification in IoT devices. In addition to ECC, the model incorporates Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) for verification, providing a lighter alternative to ECC. ZKP works by signing the input messages and subsequently verifying the data, offering a robust security measure. The implementation strategy involves simulating IoT sensors, each equipped with ECC and Zero Knowledge proof capabilities for enhanced security.  © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Introduction: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an increasingly prevalent chronic, autoimmune, and inflammatory central nervous system illness, whose common symptoms undermine the quality of life of patients and their families. Recent technical breakthroughs potentially offer continuous, reliable, sensitive, and objective remote monitoring solutions for healthcare. Wearables can be useful for evaluating falls, fatigue, sedentary behavior, exercise, and sleep quality in people with MS (PwMS). Objective: This scoping review of relevant literature explores studies investigating the perceptions of patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs) about the use of wearable technologies in the management of MS. Methods: The Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for scoping reviews was used. The search strategy was applied to the databases, MEDLINE via Ovid, Embase, APA PsycInfo, and CINAHL. Further searches were performed in IEEE, Scopus, and Web of Science. The review considered studies reporting quantitative or qualitative data on perceptions and experiences of PwMS and HCPs concerning wearables’ usability, satisfaction, barriers, and facilitators. Results: 10 studies were included in this review. Wearables’ usefulness and accessibility, ease of use, awareness, and motivational tool potential were patient-perceived facilitators of use. Barriers related to anxiety and frustration, complexity, and the design of wearables. Perceived usefulness and system requirements are identified as facilitators of using wearables by HCPs, while data security concerns and fears of increased workload and limited effectiveness in the care plan are identified as barriers to use wearables. Conclusions: This review contributes to our understanding of the benefits of wearable technologies in MS by exploring perceptions of both PwMS and HCPs. The scoping review provided a broad overview of facilitators and barriers to wearable use in MS. There is a need for further studies underlined with sound theoretical frameworks to provide a robust evidence-base for the optimal use of wearables to empower healthcare users and providers. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - The confluence of the Internet of Things (IoT) within the healthcare sector, called Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), has ushered in a transformative approach to real-time patient monitoring. Traditional methods that typically involve the direct transmission of medical sensor data to the cloud, falter under the constraints of medical IoT devices. In response, Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC), as defined by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), brings forth an innovative solution by relocating computing resources closer to the origin of data. However, MEC alone does not fully address the exigencies of constrained medical IoTs in the realm of real-time monitoring. Our architecture advances the computing continuum by seamlessly integrating local edge computing for direct data capture, MEC for nuanced data processing, and cloud computing for the comprehensive synthesis and presentation of data. This synergy is further enhanced by the introduction of a robust message queue mechanism, assuring data resilience and uninterrupted data streaming during network disruptions. With a steadfast commitment to security, our system employs stringent measures to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive patient data during transmission. This architecture represents a significant leap in healthcare technology, emphasizing the criticality of patient safety, data security, and meticulous data management. The implications of this study are profound, indicating a trajectory for future exploration into the integration of sophisticated data types and AI-driven models to further refine patient monitoring and healthcare outcomes. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - In order to conserve energy in the Internet of Things (IoT) network and also effectively handle the integrity and security issues in medical information, a framework for transmitting data that is both secure and energy efficient was proposed. It was used Enhanced Mayfly Clustering-based Q Learner Routing (EMCQLR) and Exponential Key-based Elliptical Curve Cryptography (EKECC) techniques. In EMCQLR, Enhanced Mayfly optimization Algorithm (EMOA) was used to select the Cluster Head (CH) for data collection from the nodes and form clusters of IoT medical sensors. This paper proposes a new approach called EMOA with Active Elite Approach (EMOA-AEA) to deal with the issues of slow convergence speed and the tendency of EMOA to fall into local optimum. The EMOA-AEA algorithm establishes a definite area around the most optimal mayfly in the present population, which is used to identify the top-performing CH. This region's search radius is then adjusted as needed. Elite mayflies are subsequently produced within this designated zone, and if their fitness level surpasses that of the most exceptional mayfly, the finest cluster head from these new elite mayflies is selected to replace the current population's top mayfly. After the selection of cluster head, Path-Weighted Q Reinforcement Learning (PWQRL) is used for data routing. At last, EKECC algorithm encrypts the medical records to provide data security. The experimental outcomes prove that the EMOA-AEA method surpasses the existing method in terms of network lifetime, average energy consumption, and throughput. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - This article presents a novel hardware-assisted distributed ledger-based solution for simultaneous device and data security in smart healthcare. This article presents a novel architecture that integrates PUF, blockchain, and Tangle for Security-by-Design (SbD) of healthcare cyber–physical systems (H-CPSs). Healthcare systems around the world have undergone massive technological transformation and have seen growing adoption with the advancement of Internet-of-Medical Things (IoMT). The technological transformation of healthcare systems to telemedicine, e-health, connected health, and remote health is being made possible with the sophisticated integration of IoMT with machine learning, big data, artificial intelligence (AI), and other technologies. As healthcare systems are becoming more accessible and advanced, security and privacy have become pivotal for the smooth integration and functioning of various systems in H-CPSs. In this work, we present a novel approach that integrates PUF with IOTA Tangle and blockchain and works by storing the PUF keys of a patient’s Body Area Network (BAN) inside blockchain to access, store, and share globally. Each patient has a network of smart wearables and a gateway to obtain the physiological sensor data securely. To facilitate communication among various stakeholders in healthcare systems, IOTA Tangle’s Masked Authentication Messaging (MAM) communication protocol has been used, which securely enables patients to communicate, share, and store data on Tangle. The MAM channel works in the restricted mode in the proposed architecture, which can be accessed using the patient’s gateway PUF key. Furthermore, the successful verification of PUF enables patients to securely send and share physiological sensor data from various wearable and implantable medical devices embedded with PUF. Finally, healthcare system entities like physicians, hospital admin networks, and remote monitoring systems can securely establish communication with patients using MAM and retrieve the patient’s BAN PUF keys from the blockchain securely. Our experimental analysis shows that the proposed approach successfully integrates three security primitives, PUF, blockchain, and Tangle, providing decentralized access control and security in H-CPS with minimal energy requirements, data storage, and response time. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Introduction Common, consumer-grade biosensors mounted on fitness trackers and smartwatches can measure an array of biometrics that have potential utility in post-discharge medical monitoring, especially in remote/rural communities. The feasibility characteristics for wrist-worn biosensors are poorly described for post-COVID conditions and rural populations. Methods We prospectively recruited patients in rural communities who were enrolled in an at-home rehabilitation program for post-COVID conditions. They were asked to wear a FitBit Charge 2 device and biosensor parameters were analyzed [e.g. heart rate, sleep, and activity]. Electronic patient reported outcome measures [E-PROMS] for mental [bi-weekly] and physical [daily] symptoms were collected using SMS text or email [per patient preference]. Exit surveys and interviews evaluated the patient experience. Results Ten patients were observed for an average of 58 days and half [N = 5] were monitored for 8 weeks or more. Five patients [50%] had been hospitalized with COVID [mean stay = 41 days] and 4 [36%] had required mechanical ventilation. As baseline, patients had moderate to severe levels of anxiety, depression, and stress; fatigue and shortness of breath were the most prevalent physical symptoms. Four patients [40%] already owned a smartwatch. In total, 575 patient days of patient monitoring occurred across 10 patients. Biosensor data was usable for 91.3% of study hours and surveys were completed 82.1% and 78.7% of the time for physical and mental symptoms, respectively. Positive correlations were observed between stress and resting heart rate [r = 0.360, p<0.01], stress and daily steps [r = 0.335, p<0.01], and anxiety and daily steps [r = 0.289, p<0.01]. There was a trend toward negative correlation between sleep time and physical symptom burden [r = -0.211, p = 0.05]. Patients reported an overall positive experience and identified the potential for wearable devices to improve medical safety and access to care. Concerns around data privacy/security were infrequent. Conclusions We report excellent feasibility characteristics for wrist-worn biosensors and e-PROMS as a possible substrate for multi-modal disease tracking in post-COVID conditions. Adapting consumer-grade wearables for medical use and scalable remote patient monitoring holds great potential. © 2024 Wiebe et al.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) for medical purposes offers a number of benefits, including the aptitude to follow the individual's physical state over a range of time intervals and transmitting data in real time. Using gadgets like glucose meters, heart monitoring implants, Electrocardiogram (ECG), blood pressure monitors, Electroencephalography (EEG) and Electromyography (EMG) wearable strategies, medical personnel can gather local patient wellness data and make choices based on it. The IoT devices' weak authentication and encryption procedures make them readily hackable and may expose users to a number of risks, some of which could be fatal. The Quality of Service (QoS) needs for healthcare IoT devices, such as dependability, authorization, identity and security, cannot be met by current algorithms using machine learning or blockchain approaches operating in the cloud computing environment. Henceforth the proposed work develops an advanced Fog computing (FC) to oppose advance cloud computing at an edge of networks together with Block chain topology. Fog computing has been emphasized as promising method for low-cost remote monitoring, limiting down on latency, and boosting efficiency, while blockchain has been touted for guaranteeing the security of private data, building a decentralized database, and improving data interoperability. The problem of healthcare IoT device recognition, permission and confirmation for scalability often broadcast of data in a distributed setting can be handled by merging FC with block chain. So, leveraging FC and blockchain, a creative solution to the aforementioned issue. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - While COVID-19 is still ongoing and associated with more than 5 million deaths, the scope and speed of advances over the past year in terms of scientific discovery, data dissemination, and technology have been staggering. It is not a matter of “if” but “when” we will face the next pandemic, and how we leverage technology and data management effectively to create flexible ecosystems that facilitate collaboration, equitable care, and innovation will determine its severity and scale. The aim of this review is to address emerging challenges that came to light during the pandemic in health care and innovations that enabled us to adapt and continue to care for patients. The pandemic highlighted the need for seismic shifts in care paradigms and technology with considerations related to the digital divide and health literacy for digital health interventions to reach full potential and improve health outcomes. We discuss advances in telemedicine, remote patient monitoring, and emerging wearable technologies. Despite the promise of digital health, we emphasise the importance of addressing its limitations, including interpretation challenges, accuracy of findings, and artificial intelligence–driven algorithms. We summarise the most recent recommendation of the Virtual Care Task Force to scaling virtual medical services in Canada. Finally, we propose a model for optimal implementation of health digital innovations with 5 tenets including data management, data security, digital biomarkers, useful artificial intelligence, and clinical integration. © 2021 Canadian Cardiovascular Society

AB  - Telemedicine is becoming increasingly important in recent years, especially in chronic diseases treatment. Thanks to these platforms, it is possible to assist patients remotely, being continuously monitored according to personalized care plans as if they were at the hospital. The characteristics of telemedicine platforms resulted extremely useful when Covid-19 pandemic broke out. Intense monitoring of patients at home, social distancing, and resource rationalization provided great help to medical personnel and healthcare systems. This novel disease, however, has posed new challenges, given by the quicker evolution of a patient's clinical status with respect to chronic diseases. In particular, the updates of the care plan performed remotely by doctors need to be immediately delivered to monitoring kits located at the patient's home, in order to adjust the monitoring plan of the target patient. Since this update is a critical operation, acknowledgment strategies are required to guarantee feedbacks upon delivery. Immediate updates can be achieved via a push notification system. In this paper, we present a push notification system based on HiveMQ Community Edition message broker, that provides end-to-end positive (ACK) and negative (NACK) acknowledgments, strict authentication, and authorization of users and messages, security, data consistency, and privacy. The realized system has been integrated and tested in the E@syCare telemedicine platform certified as a medical device, but it can be easily adopted by any other telemedicine solutions, as long as they can perform web service requests to the authentication server and integrate HiveMQ client library in their software components.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - This paper describes a security protocol and proof-of-concept implementation for wearable medical sensor devices that are deployed in hospitals. The sensor device measures the patient’s vital sign parameters and sends them to the hospital server, such that the data can be processed and stored in the EMR (Electronic Medical Record) of the patient. The proposed security protocol is based on symmetric-key cryptography and addresses the challenges of anonymity, unlinkability, mutual authentication and perfect forward secrecy. Moreover, it relies on decentralised authentication, avoiding an authentication server to be the single point of attack. Besides offering strong security features, the proposed protocol and implementation take into account that sensor devices are typically constrained with respect to communication bandwidth and computation power. Therefore, these parameters are evaluated in addition to the security analysis of the presented protocol. Our solution gives stronger security guarantees than related work, while featuring a comparable computation overhead and the lowest communication overhead. © 2021, IUPESM and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The health care system is overwhelming with COVID-19 patients since the end of 2019. Many countries have postponed their public screening programs and are fighting to maintain balance between essential health care and COVID-19 pandemic. At this point of time, IoT along with artificial intelligence (AI) provides a solution for a remote IoT based healthcare system. IoT based wearable devices collect data and send them to the cloud via IoT Gateway. Further, the data are analyzed by AI to raise alerts at times of emergencies like a sudden drop-in pulse rate etc. AI needs a large database for training and processing. This threatens the patient’s data security and privacy. To overcome this threat, an encryption algorithm can be used. When it comes to remote healthcare, monitoring of cardio vascular muscles is the most important of all. This can be done by an electrocardiogram (ECG). These ECG signals are transmitted in case of emergency and are stored in remote servers. The ECG signals are unique in nature and they can be used in biometric devices which attract hackers. To avoid the intruders, the data is encrypted and transmitted. In this paper, we provide a lightweight cellular automaton (CA) based encryption algorithm to suit limited power and low memory devices. For ECG based evaluation, the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database is considered. © 2021 Totem Publisher, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - E-textiles have received tremendous attention in recent years due to the capability of integrating sensors into a garment, enabling high-precision sensing of the human body. Besides sensing, a number of solutions for e-textile garments have also integrated wireless interfaces, allowing sensing data to be transmitted, and also inbuilt capacitive touch sensors, allowing users to provide instructions. While this has provided a new level of sensing that can result in unprecedented applications, there has been little attention placed around on-body edge computing for e-textiles. This study focuses on the need for a noninvasive and remote health-monitoring solution with inbuilt on-body edge computing, and how enabling such sensing and computing capabilities in a fabric environment can act as a new method for healthcare monitoring through the use of embedded computing intelligence in smart garments. Facilitating computing in e-textiles can result in a new form of on-body edge computing, where sensor information is processed very close to the body before being transmitted to an external device or wireless access point. This form of computing can provide new security and data privacy capabilities and, at the same time, provide opportunities for new energy-harvesting mechanisms to process the data through the garment. This study proposes this concept through embroidered programmable logic arrays (PLAs) integrated into e-textiles. In the same way that PLAs have programmable logic circuits by interconnecting different AND, NOT, and OR gates, we propose e-textile–based gates that are sewn into a garment and connected through conductive thread stitching. Two designs are proposed, and this includes single- and multi-layered PLAs. Experimental validations have been conducted at the individual gates and the entire PLA circuits to determine the voltage utilization and logic computing reliability. The multilayered PLA garment superseded the single-layered garment with higher levels of accuracy in the yielded results due to the enhanced design layout, which reduces the potential for short circuits and errors occurring. Our proposed approach can usher in a new form of on-body edge computing for e-textile garments for future wearable technologies, and, in particular, with the current pandemic that requires noninvasive remote health-monitoring applications.

AB  - Patient-focused healthcare, driven by COVID-19 experiences, has become a hallmark for providing healthcare services to patients across all modalities of care and in the home. The ability to capture real-time patient data, no matter the location, via remote patient monitoring, and to transmit that data to providers and organizations approved by the consumer/patient, will become a critical capability for all healthcare providers. Of all the remote patient monitoring product designs, wearable medical devices are emerging as the best positioned to support the evolving patient-focused healthcare environment. This book is for those who are evaluating, selecting, implementing, managing, or designing wearable devices to monitor the health of patients and consumers. This book will provide the knowledge to understand the issues that mitigate the risk of wearable technologies so people can deliver successful projects using these technologies. It will discuss their use in remote patient monitoring, the advantages and disadvantages of different types of physiological sensors, different wireless communication protocols, and different power sources. It will describe issues and solutions in cybersecurity and HIPAA compliance, as well as setting them up to be used in healthcare systems and by patients. © 2023 Michael W. Davis, Michael J.

AB  - Over the past decade, focus on the security and privacy aspects of implantable medical devices (IMDs) has intensified, driven by the multitude of cybersecurity vulnerabilities found in various existing devices. However, due to their strict computational, energy and physical constraints, conventional security protocols are not directly applicable to IMDs. Custom-tailored schemes have been proposed instead which, however, fail to cover the full spectrum of security features that modern IMDs and their ecosystems so critically require. In this paper we propose IMDfence, a security protocol for IMD ecosystems that provides a comprehensive yet practical security portfolio, which includes availability, non-repudiation, access control, entity authentication, remote monitoring and system scalability. The protocol also allows emergency access that results in the graceful degradation of offered services without compromising security and patient safety. The performance of the security protocol as well as its feasibility and impact on modern IMDs are extensively analyzed and evaluated. We find that IMDfence achieves the above security requirements at a mere less than 7% increase in total IMD energy consumption, and less than 14 ms and 9 kB increase in system delay and memory footprint, respectively. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The new era of information technologies made smart healthcare by including edge, Internet of Things (loT), Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), cloud computing etc. This adaptation has partially replaced the old medical system, making healthcare more efficient, easy, and customized. Wireless medical sensors are used in the smart healthcare sector to capture the patient's health data and transmit it to the remote server for treatment or diagnostic purposes. Every time a cloud-based solution is adopted to collect and preserve the sensitive and personal health information. This collected patient data is shared between the different stakeholders across the network. Due to this, healthcare systems are vulnerable to confidentiality, integrity and privacy threats. Secure data access is a big challenge in such systems. In this paper, a lightweight authentication technique with the privacy-preserving schema using fully homomorphic encryption is proposed. This approach can be used for a secure access of patient data through online mode, and also the data can be shared in an encrypted format for desired purposes of stakeholders. The proposed authentication scheme is for Internet of Medical Things that can resist all network attacks and is easy to implement. The performance analysis of the proposed work shows that overall execution time (80.03%), communication cost (15.62%) and energy consumption (79.19%) is reduced in comparison with existing work. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Adolescents and young adults (AYAs; age 15-39 years) with cancer are under-represented in cancer clinical trials because of patient, provider, and institutional barriers. Health care technology is increasingly available to and highly used among AYAs and has the potential to improve cancer care delivery. The COVID-19 pandemic forced institutions to rapidly adopt novel approaches for enrollment and monitoring of patients on cancer clinical trials, many of which have the potential for improving AYA trial participation overall. This consensus statement from the Children's Oncology Group AYA Oncology Discipline Committee reviews opportunities to use technology to optimize AYA trial enrollment and study conduct, as well as considerations for widespread implementation of these practices. The use of remote patient eligibility screening, electronic informed consent, virtual tumor boards, remote study visits, and remote patient monitoring are recommended to increase AYA access to trials and decrease the burden of participation. Widespread adoption of these strategies will require new policies focusing on reimbursement for telehealth, license portability, facile communication between electronic health record systems and advanced safeguards to maintain patient privacy and security. Studies are needed to determine optimal approaches to further incorporate technology at every stage of the clinical trial process, from enrollment through study completion.

AB  - Widespread proliferation of interconnected healthcare equipment, accompanying software, operating systems, and networks in the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) raises the risk of security compromise as the bulk of IoMT devices are not built to withstand internet attacks. In this work, we have developed a cyber-attack and anomaly detection model based on recursive feature elimination (RFE) and multilayer perceptron (MLP). The RFE approach selected optimal features using logistic regression (LR) and extreme gradient boosting regression (XGBRegressor) kernel functions. MLP parameters were adjusted by using a hyperparameter optimization and 10-fold cross-validation approach was performed for performance evaluations. The developed model was performed on various IoMT cybersecurity datasets, and attained the best accuracy rates of 99.99%, 99.94%, 98.12%, and 96.2%, using Edith Cowan University- Internet of Health Things (ECU-IoHT), Intensive Care Unit (ICU Dataset), Telemetry data, Operating systems’ data, and Network data from the testbed IoT/IIoT network (TON-IoT), and Washington University in St. Louis enhanced healthcare monitoring system (WUSTL-EHMS) datasets, respectively. The proposed method has the ability to counter cyber attacks in healthcare applications. © 2022 Nalecz Institute of Biocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering of the Polish Academy of Sciences

AB  - Introduction: To capture the patient’s attitude toward remote monitoring of motor neuron disease (MND) in care and clinical trials, and their concerns and preferences regarding the use of digital technology. Methods: We performed an international multi-centre survey study in three MND clinics in The Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Australia. The survey was co-developed by investigators and patients with MND, and sent to patients by e-mail or postal-mail. The main topics included: patients’ attitude towards remote care, participating in decentralized clinical trials, and preferences for and concerns with digital technology use. Results: In total, 332 patients with MND participated. A majority of patients indicated they would be happy to self-monitor their health from home (69%), be remotely monitored by a multidisciplinary care team (75%), and would be willing to participate in clinical trials from home (65%). Patients considered respiratory function and muscle strength most valuable for home-monitoring. The majority of patients considered the use of at least three devices/apps (75%) once a week (61%) to be acceptable for home-monitoring. Fifteen percent of patients indicated they would not wish to perform home-measurements; reporting concerns about the burden and distress of home-monitoring, privacy and data security. Conclusion: Most patients with MND exhibited a positive attitude toward the use of digital technology in both care and clinical trial settings. A subgroup of patients reported concerns with home-monitoring, which should be addressed in order to improve widespread adoption of remote digital technology in clinical MND care. © 2022, The Author(s).

Healthcare monitoring sensor cloud is one of the application that allows storing the patients’ health data generated by their wearable sensors at cloud and facilitates the authorized doctors to monitor and advise them remotely. Patients’ data at cloud must be secure. Existing security schemes (e.g., key policy attribute-based encryption [KP-ABE] and ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption [CP-ABE]) have higher computational overheads. In this paper, a security mechanism called attribute-based elliptical curve cryptography (ABECC) is proposed that guarantees data integrity, data confidentiality, and fine-grained access control. It also reduces the computational overheads. ABECC is implemented in .NET framework. Use of elliptical curve cryptography (ECC) in ABECC reduces the key length, thereby improving the encryption, decryption, and key generation time. It is observed that ABECC is 1.7 and 1.4 times faster than the existing approaches of KP-ABE and CP-ABE, respectively. Copyright © 2021, IGI Global.

AB  - Heart rate at rest and exercise may predict cardiovascular risk. Heart rate variability is a measure of variation in time between each heartbeat, representing the balance between the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system and may predict adverse cardiovascular events. With advances in technology and increasing commercial interest, the scope of remote monitoring health systems has expanded. In this review, we discuss the concepts behind cardiac signal generation and recording, wearable devices, pros and cons focusing on accuracy, ease of application of commercial and medical grade diagnostic devices, which showed promising results in terms of reliability and value. Incorporation of artificial intelligence and cloud based remote monitoring have been evolving to facilitate timely data processing, improve patient convenience and ensure data security. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has revolutionized the healthcare domain, with the introduction of remote real-time monitoring. This emerging technology has not only relieved the burden of hospital resources, but also paved the way for efficient monitoring and management of patients. According to World Health Organization (WHO), in Pakistan, cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are leading cause of deaths that amount to nearly 200,000 deaths annually. This results in high mortality rates all over Pakistan. To uplift the current architecture of healthcare in Pakistan, it is vital to develop a sustainable solution for continuous health monitoring and arrest anomalous physiological behavior before they become life-threatening. In the same pretext, this study proposes a working paper which aims to disseminate interim results of smart cardiac health monitoring using an amalgam of IoMT and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The primary objective of the proposed research is to integrate state-of-the-art ML classification algorithms to detect, in near real-time, abnormal human vitals like electrocardiogram(ECG), heart-rate(HR), blood pressure(BP), etc. As network latency is critical to this application, therefore, to improve overall Quality of Service (QoS) of the system, we propose to fuse Edge Intelligence interfaced with multiple IoMT enabled bio-sensors. These sensors will form a body area sensor network(BSN) that records cardiac-related human vitals. In our preliminary research, that is presented in this paper, we trained several machine learning algorithms on the MIMIC-III clinical data-set and reviewed their performance. Among the 7 tested supervised classification algorithms, Random-Forest achieved the highest accuracy of 95% on the test set. Finally, to offer a remote patient management and monitoring panel, we developed an authenticated web-portal to inculcate data privacy and security in the proposed system.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Nowadays, healthcare is growing rapidly due to the large development of new technologies such as IoT and wearable devices. These devices are widely used to ensure remote patient monitoring. The current implementation is based on a client/server architecture. This raises several challenges regarding security and privacy that make healthcare systems more susceptible to several attacks. Therefore, health data are subject to strict regulatory and security requirements. To overcome these challenges and comply with security regulations, the adoption of a distributed architecture is a necessity. Due to its distributed nature and its security promises, Blockchain has a large interest as a sophisticated technology to solve the security challenges in IoT-based systems. Motivated by these factors, this work proposes BlockMedCare, a secure healthcare system that integrates IoT with Blockchain. The system is designed to support remote patient monitoring, especially when it comes to chronic diseases that require regular monitoring. We took into consideration three main parameters: security, scalability, and processing time. The security is ensured by using the re-encryption proxy combined with Blockchain to store hash data. Smart contracts are used for access control. To ensure Blockchain scalability, an off-chain database based on IPFS is used to store data. To speed up the data storage process, we use an Ethereum Blockchain-based proof of authority. As a use case, we applied the system to diabetes management and showed the execution results based on the system interfaces. The experimental system has demonstrated a good improvement of healthcare systems in terms of security face to the existing methods. © 2022

AB  - At present, the novel coronavirus is posing a bigger threat to the whole human race. However, adopting emerging technologies like the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, blockchain technology, and machine learning helps in a greater deal to handle the pandemic effectively. The virus has cost many human lives, and one primary reason could be neglecting the symptoms. The earlier identification of the disease will help in providing immediate medical support. Wearable devices are effective in identifying the coronavirus disease, i.e., COVID-19 cases than the traditional methods. They help in improved tracking and management of the disease. This paper intends to present a framework where the wearable devices associated with the Internet of Things (IoT) collect information from individuals and store it either in a cloud server or to a local fog computing node. Furthermore, the implementation of a decentralized storage system to collect, analyze, and preserve the gathered data among the healthcare professionals is also included in the system. The system takes advantage of blockchain systems to automate smart contracts. The goal of this research is to see how wearable gadgets might help combat COVID-19’s effects by providing efficient methods for identification, monitoring, and collaboration in remote patient monitoring. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - The rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) stimulates the innovation for the health-related devices such as remote patient monitoring, connected inhalers and ingestible sensors. Simultaneously, with the aid of numerous equipments, a great number of collected data can be used for disease prediction or diagnosis model establishment. However, the potential patient data leak will also bring privacy and security issues in the interaction period. To deal with these existing issues, we propose a decentralized, efficient, and privacy-enhanced federated edge learning system called DEEP-FEL, which enables medical devices in different institutions to collaboratively train a global model without raw data mutual exchange. Firstly, we design a hierarchical ring topology to alleviate centralization of the conventional training framework, and formulate the ring construction as an optimization problem, which can be solved by an efficient heuristic algorithm. Subsequently, we design an efficient parameter aggregation algorithm for distributed medical institutions to generate a new global model, and the total amount of data transmitted by N nodes is only 2/N times that of traditional algorithm. In addition, data security among different medical institutions is enhanced by adding artificial noise to the edge model. Finally, experimental results on three medical datasets demonstrate the superiority of our system.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The aging population and the growing requirement of healthcare services in clinics encourage the arrival of remote elderly patient monitoring. Development in the physiologic sensory systems and the advancement of stable wireless network low energy mechanics have allowed remote health monitoring systems to be developed. Smart homes, which have wearable sensors and medical actuators, as well as up-to-date communication and information technology, have the ability to monitor remotely the elderly health and well-being in a simple fashion with low cost. Therefore, the elderly will stay in their comfortable homes rather than going to hospitals where sometimes they face expensive and limited facilities. In a real-time, medical staff can also keep track of the overall health conditions of the elderly people and provide proper feedback and support at a distance. In this paper, we introduce a summary of elderly people monitoring applications using IoT frameworks. In addition, the paper discusses the patient data security and integrity. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - The past decade has seen substantial growth in the prevalence and capabilities of wearable devices. For instance, recent human activity recognition (HAR) research has explored using wearable devices in applications such as remote monitoring of patients, detection of gait abnormalities, and cognitive disease identification. However, data collection poses a major challenge in developing HAR systems, especially because of the need to store data at a central location. This raises privacy concerns and makes continuous data collection difficult and expensive due to the high cost of transferring data from a user's wearable device to a central repository. Considering this, we explore the adoption of federated learning (FL) as a potential solution to address the privacy and cost issues associated with data collection in HAR. More specifically, we investigate the performance and behavioral differences between FL and deep learning (DL) HAR models, under various conditions relevant to real-world deployments. Namely, we explore the differences between the two types of models when (i) using data from different sensor placements, (ii) having access to users with data from heterogeneous sensor placements, (iii) considering bandwidth efficiency, and (iv) dealing with data with incorrect labels. Our results show that FL models suffer from a consistent performance deficit in comparison to their DL counterparts, but achieve these results with much better bandwidth efficiency. Furthermore, we observe that FL models exhibit very similar responses to those of DL models when exposed to data from heterogeneous sensor placements. Finally, we show that the FL models are more robust to data with incorrect labels than their centralized DL counterparts.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The increasing popularity of wearable consumer products can play a significant role in the healthcare sector. The recognition of human activities from IoT is an important building block in this context. While the analysis of the generated datastream can have many benefits from a health point of view, it can also lead to privacy threats by exposing highly sensitive information. In this article, we propose a framework that relies on machine learning to efficiently recognise the user activity, useful for personal healthcare monitoring, while limiting the risk of users re-identification from biometric patterns characterizing each individual. To achieve that, we show that features in temporal domain are useful to discriminate user activity while features in frequency domain lead to distinguish the user identity. We then design a novel protection mechanism processing the raw signal on the user's smartphone to select relevant features for activity recognition and normalise features sensitive to re-identification. These unlinkable features are then transferred to the application server. We extensively evaluate our framework with reference datasets: Results show an accurate activity recognition (87%) while limiting the re-identification rate (33%). This represents a slight decrease of utility (9%) against a large privacy improvement (53%) compared to state-of-the-art baselines. © 2020 ACM.

AB  - The Internet of Health Things (IoHT) is an extended version of the Internet of Things that is acting a starring role in data sharing remotely. These remote data sources consist of physiological processes, such as treatment progress, patient monitoring, and consultation. The main purpose of IoHT platform is to intervene independently from geographically remote areas by providing low-cost preventive or active healthcare services. Several low-power biomedical sensors with limited computing capabilities provide IoHT's communication, integration, computation, and interoperability. However, IoHT transfers IoT data via IP-centric Internet, which has implications for security and privacy. To address this issue, in this paper, we suggest using named data networking (NDN), a future Internet model that is well suited for mobile patients and caregivers. As the IoHT contains a lot of personal information about a user's physical condition, which can be detrimental to users' finances and health if leaked, therefore, data protection is important in the IoHT. Experts and scholars have researched this area, but the reconstruction of existing schemes could be further improved. Also, doing computing-intensive tasks leads to slower response times, which further worsens the performance of IoHT. We are trying to resolve such an error, so a new NDN-based certificateless signcryption scheme is proposed for IoHT using the security hardness of the hyperelliptic curve cryptosystem. Security analysis and comparisons with existing schemes show the viability of the designed scheme. The final results confirm that the designed scheme provides better security with minimal computational and communicational resources. Finally, we validate the security of the designed scheme against man-in-the-middle attacks and replay attacks using the AVISPA tool.  © 2021 Aroosa et al.

AB  - Healthcare has become one of the most important aspects of people's lives, resulting in a surge in medical big data. Healthcare providers are increasingly using Internet of Things (IoT)-based wearable technologies to speed up diagnosis and treatment. In recent years, Through the Internet, billions of sensors, gadgets, and vehicles have been connected. One such example is for the treatment and care of patients, technology - remote patient monitoring - is already commonplace. However, these technologies also offer serious privacy and data security problems. Data transactions are transferred and logged. These medical data security and privacy issues might ensue from a pause in therapy, putting the patient's life in jeopardy. We planned a framework to manage and analyse healthcare large data in a safe manner based on blockchain. Our model's enhanced privacy and security characteristics are based on data sanitization and restoration techniques. The framework shown here make data and transactions more secure.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Digitization of healthcare will be a major innovation driver in the coming decade. Also, enabled by technological advancements and electronics miniaturization, wearable health device (WHD) applications are expected to grow exponentially. This, in turn, may make 4P medicine (predictive, precise, preventive and personalized) a more attainable goal within dialysis patient care. This article discusses different use cases where WHD could be of relevance for dialysis patient care, i.e. measurement of heart rate, arrhythmia detection, blood pressure, hyperkalaemia, fluid overload and physical activity. After adequate validation of the different WHD in this specific population, data obtained from WHD could form part of a body area network (BAN), which could serve different purposes such as feedback on actionable parameters like physical inactivity, fluid overload, danger signalling or event prediction. For a BAN to become clinical reality, not only must technical issues, cybersecurity and data privacy be addressed, but also adequate models based on artificial intelligence and mathematical analysis need to be developed for signal optimization, data representation, data reliability labelling and interpretation. Moreover, the potential of WHD and BAN can only be fulfilled if they are part of a transformative healthcare system with a shared responsibility between patients, healthcare providers and the payors, using a step-up approach that may include digital assistants and dedicated 'digital clinics'. The coming decade will be critical in observing how these developments will impact and transform dialysis patient care and will undoubtedly ask for an increased 'digital literacy' for all those implicated in their care. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - The term «Internet of Medical Things» (IoMT) refers to a set of devices and technologies for remote monitoring of patients’ health using wearable devices. One primary problem with patient’s data is ensuring privacy when it is transmitted over open communication channels and stored in cloud systems. A whole range of different approaches to these issues are available. However, when it comes to millions of IoT devices, technologies that have already become classic for Internet resources are not suitable in many aspects at once. The aim of this work is to develop methods and protocols for secure interaction between portable diagnostic devices and cloud services for the analysis and processing of medical data in the Internet of Medical Things networks. The work considered existing technologies and solutions for ensuring security in IoMT networks and personalized medicine systems; also, it focused on secure machine learning methods. Previous studies have emphasized attribute-based encryption (ABE) as a prospective method for data privacy and security. These algorithms solve many problems for IoMT applications: patient’s data confidentiality, flexible key management, fine-grained access control mechanisms, and user control over data. We have proposed a framework for processing patient data from portable diagnostic devices using ABE methods. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Background: Functional decline in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is typically measured using single-time point subjective rating scales, which rely on direct observation or (caregiver) recall. Remote monitoring technologies (RMTs), such as smartphone applications, wearables, and home-based sensors, can change these periodic subjective assessments to more frequent, or even continuous, objective monitoring. The aim of the RADAR-AD study is to assess the accuracy and validity of RMTs in measuring functional decline in a real-world environment across preclinical-to-moderate stages of AD compared to standard clinical rating scales. Methods: This study includes three tiers. For the main study, we will include participants (n = 220) with preclinical AD, prodromal AD, mild-to-moderate AD, and healthy controls, classified by MMSE and CDR score, from clinical sites equally distributed over 13 European countries. Participants will undergo extensive neuropsychological testing and physical examination. The RMT assessments, performed over an 8-week period, include walk tests, financial management tasks, an augmented reality game, two activity trackers, and two smartphone applications installed on the participants’ phone. In the first sub-study, fixed sensors will be installed in the homes of a representative sub-sample of 40 participants. In the second sub-study, 10 participants will stay in a smart home for 1 week. The primary outcome of this study is the difference in functional domain profiles assessed using RMTs between the four study groups. The four participant groups will be compared for each RMT outcome measure separately. Each RMT outcome will be compared to a standard clinical test which measures the same functional or cognitive domain. Finally, multivariate prediction models will be developed. Data collection and privacy are important aspects of the project, which will be managed using the RADAR-base data platform running on specifically designed biomedical research computing infrastructure. Results: First results are expected to be disseminated in 2022. Conclusion: Our study is well placed to evaluate the clinical utility of RMT assessments. Leveraging modern-day technology may deliver new and improved methods for accurately monitoring functional decline in all stages of AD. It is greatly anticipated that these methods could lead to objective and real-life functional endpoints with increased sensitivity to pharmacological agent signal detection. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Fragmentation of healthcare systems through limited cross-speciality communication and intermittent, intervention-based care, without insight into follow-up and compliance, results in poor patient experiences and potentially contributes to suboptimal outcomes. Data-driven tools and novel technologies have the capability to address these shortcomings, but insights from all stakeholders in the care continuum remain lacking. A structured online questionnaire was given to respondents (n = 1432) in nine global geographies to investigate attitudes to the use of data and novel technologies in the management of vascular disease. Patients with coronary or peripheral artery disease (n = 961), physicians responsible for their care (n = 345), and administrators/healthcare leaders with responsibility for commissioning/procuring cardiovascular services (n = 126) were included. Narrative themes arising from the survey included patients’ desire for more personalized healthcare, shared decision-making, and improved communication. Patients, administrators, and physicians perceived and experienced deficiencies in continuity of care, and all acknowledged the potential for data-driven techniques and novel technologies to address some of these shortcomings. Further, physicians and administrators saw the ‘upstream’ segment of the care journey—before diagnosis, at point of diagnosis, and when determining treatment—as key to enabling tangible improvements in patient experience and outcomes. Finally, despite acceptance that data sharing is critical to the success of such interventions, there remains persistent issues related to trust and transparency. The current fragmented care continuum could be improved and streamlined through the adoption of advanced data analytics and novel technologies, including diagnostic and monitoring techniques. Such an approach could enable the refocusing of healthcare from intermittent contacts and intervention-only focus to a more holistic patient view. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Background and Objectives: The healthcare industry is fast accepting the benefits of Internet of Medical Things (IoMTs) and incorporating the services in day-to-day activity. The objective of this review was to comprehensively review the IoMTs, briefly revisit the functioning architecture, classify, list the challenges and possible solutions, and suggest the future trends among IoMTs usage and implementation. Materials and Methods: During April 2021, an extensive search for articles for Internet of Medical Things (IoMTs), medical devices, Internet of Things (IoTs) with biosensors either in title or in keywords was done using PubMed, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, and Web of Science databases. Studies were categorized into two types: those evaluating the clinical outcomes of IoMTs and those evaluating the technological basis of IoMTs. Results: IoMT architecture was reviewed under four headings: sensors, IoT gateway/framework, machine learning, and reporting tools. IoMT classification based on place of usage (body centric IoMTs, hospital IoMTs with point of care kiosks, and ubiquitous IoMTs), based on the system-wise application (cardiovascular, renal, pulmonary, endocrine, medication) and based on outcomes (fitness-alone IoMTs, clinical grading and monitoring IoMTs, and remote patient monitoring IoMTs) is proposed. Conclusion: IoMTs can be classified based on the place of usage into body centric, hospital-based, and ubiquitous systems. Classification based on the body systems and sensors aids in first-hand information about the existing IoMTs. Challenges for effective implementation of IoMTs are interoperability, data privacy, security, regulatory, and infrastructural costs. The future is promising for IoMTs with robust technological improvement and effective implementation.  © 2022 Medical Journal of Babylon | Published by Wolters Kluwer-Medknow.

AB  - Purpose of Review: This review discusses how wearable devices—sensors externally applied to the body to measure a physiological signal—can be used in heart failure (HF) care. Recent Findings: Most wearables are marketed to consumers and can measure movement, heart rate, and blood pressure; detect and monitor arrhythmia; and support exercise training and rehabilitation. Wearable devices targeted at healthcare professionals include ECG patch recorders and vests, patches, and textiles with in-built sensors for improved prognostication and the early detection of acute decompensation. Integrating data from wearables into clinical decision-making has been slow due to clinical inertia and concerns regarding data security and validity, lack of evidence of meaningful impact, interoperability, regulatory and reimbursement issues, and legal liability. Summary: Although few studies have assessed how best to integrate wearable technologies into clinical practice, their use is rapidly expanding and may support improved decision-making by patients and healthcare professionals along the whole patient pathway. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine Learning (ML) based Smart Healthcare Surveillance System (SHSS) enhances the monitoring service quality of the present healthcare sectors. Efficient SHSS for specially heart disease is a challenging task. It involves collecting data of vital parameters of the body from different sensors (wearable sensors, implanted sensors), then filtering that to remove less important data, and finally data analyzing for taking the decision to provide proper treatment. Diseases can be caused by changing lifestyle or changing in lifestyle may be the symptom of a disease. IoT can provide services not only for detecting heart disease for future but also it can serve in emergency situations. The primary goal of this surveillance system is to monitor changes in a patient’s health in order to predict heart disease and deliver appropriate medicine via an automated procedure in the real-time environment. The SHSS uses edge layer to provide real-time services and the cloud layer for further latency tolerable analysis. Security and privacy are inevitable part of SHSS as it works with sensitive data of the patients. So, data security and user access mechanism should be involved. In this paper we have proposed an architecture of SHSS for heart disease, and discussed and analyzed the efficiency of different ML algorithms for making prediction of heart disease. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Remote healthcare technologies provide a platform for efficient communication and effective long-term monitoring of patients. Studies have shown improved outcomes when remote monitoring tools were used for chronic illness management. While patients and physicians are the immediate users, they are not the only stakeholders influential in the design, use, and implementation of these systems. Other important stakeholders include insurance companies that pay for these technologies, an array of healthcare providers that aid physicians in patient care, and family members whose lives can be affected by changes in their loved ones' care. Incorporating the needs of all stakeholders into system design presents a significant challenge. Patients generally need systems that are affordable and that are covered by their insurance. Regulatory agencies, on the other hand, require strict data security measures that could increase manufacturing costs and, in turn, costs to the patient. Based on a review of literature, this paper evaluates the enablers and barriers to the adoption of remote healthcare technologies and identifies and analyses the needs of the major stakeholder groups involved in integration of these technologies into the overall healthcare system. This analysis is then used to outline a systematic framework for the definition of system requirements. © 2016 Proceedings of the 2016 Industrial and Systems Engineering Research Conference, ISERC 2016.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is essential in innovative applications such as smart cities, smart homes, education, healthcare, transportation, and defense operations. IoT applications are particularly beneficial for providing healthcare because they enable secure and real-time remote patient monitoring to improve the quality of people’s lives. This review paper explores the latest trends in healthcare-monitoring systems by implementing the role of the IoT. The work discusses the benefits of IoT-based healthcare systems with regard to their significance, and the benefits of IoT healthcare. We provide a systematic review on recent studies of IoT-based healthcare-monitoring systems through literature review. The literature review compares various systems’ effectiveness, efficiency, data protection, privacy, security, and monitoring. The paper also explores wireless- and wearable-sensor-based IoT monitoring systems and provides a classification of healthcare-monitoring sensors. We also elaborate, in detail, on the challenges and open issues regarding healthcare security and privacy, and QoS. Finally, suggestions and recommendations for IoT healthcare applications are laid down at the end of the study along with future directions related to various recent technology trends. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Social isolation is likely to be recommended for older adults due to COVID-19, with ongoing reduced clinical contact suggested for this population. This has increased the need for remote memory clinics, we therefore review the literature, current practices and guidelines on organizing such remote memory clinics, focusing on assessment of cognition, function and other relevant measurements, proposing a novel pathway based on three levels of complexity: simple telephone or video-based interviews and testing using available tests (Level 1), digitized and validated methods based on standard pen-and-paper tests and scales (Level 2), and finally fully digitized cognitive batteries and remote measurement technologies (RMTs, Level 3). Pros and cons of these strategies are discussed. Remotely collected data negates the need for frail patients or carers to commute to clinic and offers valuable insights into progression over time, as well as treatment responses to therapeutic interventions, providing a more realistic and contextualized environment for data-collection. Notwithstanding several challenges related to internet access, computer skills, limited evidence base and regulatory and data protection issues, digital biomarkers collected remotely have significant potential for diagnosis and symptom management in older adults and we propose a framework and pathway for how technologies can be implemented to support remote memory clinics. These platforms are also well-placed for administration of digital cognitive training and other interventions. The individual, societal and public/private costs of COVID-19 are high and will continue to rise for some time but the challenges the pandemic has placed on memory services also provides an opportunity to embrace novel approaches. Remote memory clinics’ financial, logistical, clinical and practical benefits have been highlighted by COVID-19, supporting their use to not only be maintained when social distancing legislation is lifted but to be devoted extra resources and attention to fully potentiate this valuable arm of clinical assessment and care. © Copyright © 2020 Owens, Ballard, Beigi, Kalafatis, Brooker, Lavelle, Brønnick, Sauer, Boddington, Velayudhan and Aarsland.

AB  - Modernizing inhaled medications through digital technology can help address persistent problems of non-adherence and poor inhaler technique in patients with obstructive lung diseases. With a growing body of supportive clinical studies, advances in digital inhaler sensors and platforms, greater support from payers and healthcare organizations, significant growth with these technologies is expected. While all digital (smart) inhalers record adherence, these are distinguished by their compatibility with commercial inhalers, capabilities to guide inhaler technique, use of patient-reported outcomes, and user-friendliness for both the healthcare professional (HCP) and patient. Due to the complexity and novelty of employing digital inhalers, collaboration with multiple entities within health systems is necessary and a well-planned integration is needed. For HCPs and patients, cybersecurity and privacy are critical, it will require review by each healthcare organization. In the US, some payers reimburse for remote monitoring using digital inhalers, but reimbursement is currently unavailable in other countries. There are several models for remote patient care, as employing an active, ongoing digital interface between the HCP and patient or they may choose to only review data at clinical encounters. Personalization of therapies and feedback are key to success. While digital inhaler malfunction uncommonly occurs, patient attrition over a year is significant. Some patients will be challenged to use digital platforms or have the necessary technology. Additional research is needed to address cost-effectiveness, in vivo accuracy of inspiratory measurement capable devices, ability to teach inhaler technique, their application for monitoring lung function, and lastly real-world adoption and implementation in routine clinical practice. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Policy Points Millions of life-sustaining implantable devices collect and relay massive amounts of digital health data, increasingly by using user-downloaded smartphone applications to facilitate data relay to clinicians via manufacturer servers. Our analysis of health privacy laws indicates that most US patients may have little access to their own digital health data in the United States under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Privacy Rule, whereas the EU General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act grant greater access to device-collected data. Our normative analysis argues for consistently granting patients access to the raw data collected by their implantable devices. Context: Millions of life-sustaining implantable devices collect and relay massive amounts of digital health data, increasingly by using user-downloaded smartphone applications to facilitate data relay to clinicians via manufacturer servers. Whether patients have either legal or normative claims to data collected by these devices, particularly in the raw, granular format beyond that summarized in their medical records, remains incompletely explored. Methods: Using pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) as a clinical model, we outline the clinical ecosystem of data collection, relay, retrieval, and documentation. We consider the legal implications of US and European privacy regulations for patient access to either summary or raw device data. Lastly, we evaluate ethical arguments for or against providing patients access to data beyond the summaries presented in medical records. Findings: Our analysis of applicable health privacy laws indicates that US patients may have little access to their raw data collected and held by device manufacturers in the United States under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Privacy Rule, whereas the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) grants greater access to device-collected data when the processing of personal data falls under the GDPR's territorial scope. The California Consumer Privacy Act, the “little sister” of the GDPR, also grants greater rights to California residents. By contrast, our normative analysis argues for consistently granting patients access to the raw data collected by their implantable devices. Smartphone applications are increasingly involved in the collection, relay, retrieval, and documentation of these data. Therefore, we argue that smartphone user agreements are an emerging but potentially underutilized opportunity for clarifying both legal and ethical claims for device-derived data. Conclusions: Current health privacy legislation incompletely supports patients’ normative claims for access to digital health data. © 2020 Milbank Memorial Fund

AB  - This chapter presents several aspects regarding IoT (Internet of Things) and communication technology synergies for remote services in healthcare for patients with higher risks that justify remote monitoring. According to STATISTICA studies, today there are around 26.66 billion IoT connected devices, and by 2025, the installed base of the IoT devices is forecasted to grow to almost 75.44 billion worldwide, while 25% of cyberattacks will be targeting IoT devices. In the new context of personalized medicine, a series of scenarios for the use of communications services based on 5G and IoT are emerging, taking into account the risks for data security that appears in the case of these applications. Between security and high-power computing, there is a robust direct correlation, which means that low-power computing could generate inherent cybersecurity risks. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

AB  - This chapter presents several aspects regarding sensitive data privacy and cloud security for patients diagnosed with the chronic condition using homecare remote monitoring services. The wearable biosensors used by patients for remote monitoring (blood pressure, glucose level, pulse, ECG, or EEG) are based on the IoT platform hosted in the cloud. Sensitive data privacy can be achieved by anonymization in order to avoid the security risks, because remote monitoring are requested for the recordings of vital signs and sensitive personal information, such as name, address, telephone, date of birth, social insurance number, health status data, diagnosis results, and treatment schemas. The values of vital signs are useful in statistics for predictive modeling in order to understand and anticipate the behaviors of diseases. In addition, IoT security solutions to remote monitoring should involve setting the privacy levels for cloud types (private and public). The proposed approach is to split the privacy by levels of access that will ensure the security and privacy by using a different level of protection for different accounts (doctors and patients). © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

AB  - Background: Over recent years, interest in the development of smart health technologies aimed at supporting independent living for older populations has increased. The integration of innovative technologies, such as the Internet of Things, wearable technologies, artificial intelligence, and ambient-assisted living applications, represents a valuable solution for this scope. Designing such an integrated system requires addressing several aspects (eg, equipment selection, data management, analytics, costs, and users'needs) and involving different areas of expertise (eg, medical science, service design, biomedical and computer engineering). Objective: The objective of this study is 2-fold; we aimed to design the functionalities of a smart health platform addressing 5 chronic conditions prevalent in the older population (ie, hearing loss, cardiovascular diseases, cognitive impairments, mental health problems, and balance disorders) by considering both older adults'and clinicians' perspectives and to evaluate the identified smart health platform functionalities with a small group of older adults. Methods: Overall, 24 older adults (aged >65 years) and 118 clinicians were interviewed through focus group activities and web-based questionnaires to elicit the smart health platform requirements. Considering the elicited requirements, the main functionalities of smart health platform were designed. Then, a focus group involving 6 older adults was conducted to evaluate the proposed solution in terms of usefulness, credibility, desirability, and learnability. Results: Eight main functionalities were identified and assessed-cognitive training and hearing training (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 6/6, 100%; learnability: 6/6, 100%), monitoring of physiological parameters (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 6/6, 100%; learnability: 5/6, 83%), physical training (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 5/6, 83%; learnability: 2/6, 33%), psychoeducational intervention (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 4/6, 67%; learnability: 2/6, 33%), mood monitoring (usefulness: 4/6, 67%; credibility: 4/6, 67%; desirability: 3/6, 50%; learnability: 5/6, 50%), diet plan (usefulness: 5/6, 83%; credibility: 4/6, 67%; desirability: 1/6, 17%; learnability: 2/6, 33%), and environment monitoring and adjustment (usefulness: 1/6, 17%; credibility: 1/6, 17%; desirability: 0/6, 0%; learnability: 0/6, 0%). Most of them were highly appreciated by older participants, with the only exception being environment monitoring and adjustment. The results showed that the proposed functionalities met the needs and expectations of users (eg, improved self-management of patients' disease and enhanced patient safety). However, some aspects need to be addressed (eg, technical and privacy issues). Conclusions: The presented smart health platform functionalities seem to be able to meet older adults' needs and desires to enhance their self-awareness and self-management of their medical condition, encourage healthy and independent living, and provide evidence-based support for clinicians' decision-making. Further research with a larger and more heterogeneous pool of stakeholders in terms of demographics and clinical conditions is needed to assess system acceptability and overall user experience in free-living conditions. © 2022 JMIR Publications Inc..

AB  - Remote health monitoring systems are used to audit implantable medical devices or patients’ health in a non-clinical setting. These systems are prone to cyberattacks exploiting their critical vulnerabilities. Thus, threatening patients’ health and confidentiality. In this paper, a pacemaker automatic remote monitoring system (PARMS) is modeled using architecture analysis and design language (AADL), formally characterized, and checked using the JKind model checker tool. The generated attack graph is visualized using the Graphviz tool, and classifies security breaches through the violation of the security features of significance. The developed attack graph showed the essentiality of setting up appropriate security measures in PARMS. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Blockchain technology provides a way to store information that makes it difficult to alter and hack. In today’s health scenario, tracking of medical devices, drugs, claims, payments, data sharing, and exchanging and using information is a cumbersome job. Blockchain technology overcomes this and provides safe and secure healthcare data management for various activities. The Ethereum framework is used for generating blockchain-based healthcare smart contracts that help us to maintain patient records while managing claim payment, security, and privacy. Further, this gives secure and proficient admittance to clinical information while protecting the patient’s personal data. In this work, we discuss how blockchain technology can achieve the security of electronic medical records.

AB  - Modern technologies have been integrated into medical systems to assist healthcare systems in the areas of real-time disease analysis, remote monitoring, and real-time drug prescriptions, among other things. These technologies have substantially aided in the storage of patients’ personal information and symptoms, as well as the quality of healthcare personnel’s services. However, the security and privacy of patients have attracted great attention in the healthcare system. Another serious concern in implementing security for patients’ medical information is data privacy over the IoMT-based system. Therefore, a steganography model is proposed in this paper to secure IoMT-based medical data and information. Steganography is utilised to conceal private information, to provide security and privacy of medical information. The paper results show high resistance to data loss, and reveal remarkable protection in terms of privacy and security of IoMT-based system. The performance metrics show a better result concerning PSNR (66.45), RMES (0.98245), and MSE (0.8364) respectively. Copyright © 2022 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - The current public health crisis has highlighted the need to accelerate healthcare innovation. Despite unwavering levels of cooperation among academia, industry, and policy makers, it can still take years to bring a life-saving product to market. There are some obvious limitations, including lack of blinding or masking and small sample size, which render the results less applicable to the real world. Traditional randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are lengthy, expensive, and have a low success rate. There is a growing acknowledgement that the current process no longer fully meets the growing healthcare needs. Advances in technology coupled with proliferation of telehealth modalities, sensors, wearable and connected devices have paved the way for a new paradigm. Virtual randomized controlled trials (vRCTs) have the potential to drastically shorten the clinical trial cycle while maximizing patient-centricity, compliance, and recruitment. This new approach can inform clinical trials in real time and with a holistic view of a patient’s health. This paper provides an overview of virtual clinical trials, addressing critical issues, including regulatory compliance, data security, privacy, and ownership. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - With the advances in wireless communication and Internet of things, wireless body area networks (WBANs) have attracted more and more attention because of the potential in improving the quality of health care services. With the help of WBANs, the user can access the patient's life-critical data generated by miniaturised medical sensors, and remote health care monitoring services are provided. Since the open nature of wireless channel and sensitivity of transmitted information, the security and privacy of such personal data are becoming important issues that must be dealt with. In the past few years, a large number of authentication schemes had been proposed to solve these issues. However, most of the existing schemes are not secure enough. As a step toward this direction, in this study, the authors present a privacy-preserving authentication scheme with adaptive resilience of desynchronisation attacks for WBANs, in which lightweight crypto-modules are adopted to pursue the best efficiency. The proposed scheme adopts the pseudonym identity technique to provide user anonymity, and one-way hash chain technique and serial number method are employed to ensure forward secrecy and resist desynchronisation attack, respectively. Analysis and comparison results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves a delicate balance between security and efficiency. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2020

AB  - The widespread use of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) leaves a path for numerous cybercriminal activities to target patients and hospitals using these networked medical devices and also raises numerous security and privacy concerns for healthcare professionals dealing with sensitive and life-saving medical information. In this paper, we propose a logistic regression model-based feature selection approach to form a minimum set of significant features where intrusion detection is then conducted based on the selected features. The approach is evaluated with a public dataset collected in real-time from a medical network, and the experimental evaluation results show that the proposed feature selection approach achieves an accuracy of 81.96% on the testing dataset, where 1168 attacks are detected out of 1931 attack instances, that outperforms the traditional PCA-based approach, where only 354 attacks are detected when evaluated with the same benchmark dataset. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The healthcare system that depends on the Internet of Things (IoT) assists individuals and aids their vital everyday life activities. The affordability and user-friendliness of the usage of IoT start revolutionizing healthcare services. The IoT and its related technologies have emerged as the most preferred use cases in the healthcare system. Hence, the security and privacy issues associated with smart healthcare systems and their participated entities make its general acceptance still a dream. Also, as a remote patient monitoring system using IoT-based devices are the increase in privacy, popularity, accessibility, security concerns of logging and the transfer of medical data continue arising. Therefore, this chapter proposes IoT-based blockchain-protected medical data utilizing a smart contract for secure analysis and management of wearable sensors based on the Ethereum protocol. The integration of blockchain will counter the security and privacy issues that may arise using IoT-based wearable devices in the healthcare monitoring system, thus facilitating safe and secure storage of patients’ information in the utilization of IoT devices in the healthcare system. IoT-based healthcare can be employed to enhance the well-being of patients, make the healthcare system more effective, and help respond quickly to emergencies. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Background: Mobile health (mHealth) technologies, such as wearable sensors, smart health devices, and mobile apps, that are capable of supporting pregnancy care are emerging. Although mHealth could be used to facilitate the tracking of health changes during pregnancy, challenges remain in data collection compliance and technology engagement among pregnant women. Understanding the interests, preferences, and requirements of pregnant women and those of clinicians is needed when designing and introducing mHealth solutions for supporting pregnant women’s monitoring of health and risk factors throughout their pregnancy journey. Objective: This study aims to understand clinicians’ and pregnant women’s perceptions on the potential use of mHealth, including factors that may influence their engagement with mHealth technologies and the implications for technology design and implementation. Methods: A qualitative study using semistructured interviews was conducted with 4 pregnant women, 4 postnatal women, and 13 clinicians working in perinatal care. Results: Clinicians perceived the potential benefit of mHealth in supporting different levels of health and well-being monitoring, risk assessment, and care provision in pregnancy care. Most pregnant and postnatal female participants were open to the use of wearables and health monitoring devices and were more likely to use these technologies if they knew that clinicians were monitoring their data. Although it was acknowledged that some pregnancy-related medical conditions are suitable for an mHealth model of remote monitoring, the clinical and technical challenges in the introduction of mHealth for pregnancy care were also identified. Incorporating appropriate health and well-being measures, intelligently detecting any abnormalities, and providing tailored information for pregnant women were the critical aspects, whereas usability and data privacy were among the main concerns of the participants. Moreover, this study highlighted the challenges of engaging pregnant women in longitudinal mHealth monitoring, the additional work required for clinicians to monitor the data, and the need for an evidence-based technical solution. Conclusions: Clinical, technical, and practical factors associated with the use of mHealth to monitor health and well-being in pregnant women need to be considered during the design and feasibility evaluation stages. Technical solutions and appropriate strategies for motivating pregnant women are critical to supporting their long-term data collection compliance and engagement with mHealth technology during pregnancy. ©Jane Li, David Silvera-Tawil, Marlien Varnfield, M Sazzad Hussain, Vanitha Math.

AB  - With the proliferation of intelligent services and applications authorized by artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things has penetrated into many aspects of our daily lives, and the medical field is no exception. The medical Internet of Things (MIoT) can be applied to wearable devices, remote diagnosis, mobile medical treatment, and remote monitoring. There is a large amount of medical information in the databases of various medical institutions. Nevertheless, due to the particularity of medical data, it is extremely related to personal privacy, and the data cannot be shared, resulting in data islands. Federated learning (FL), as a distributed collaborative artificial intelligence method, provides a solution. However, FL also involves multiple security and privacy issues. This paper proposes an adaptive Differential Privacy Federated Learning Medical IoT (DPFL-MIoT) model. Specifically, when the user updates the model locally, we propose a differential privacy federated learning deep neural network with adaptive gradient descent (DPFLAGD-DNN) algorithm, which can adaptively add noise to the model parameters according to the characteristics and gradient of the training data. Since privacy leaks often occur in downlink, we present differential privacy federated learning (DP-FL) algorithm where adaptive noise is added to the parameters when the server distributes the parameters. Our method effectively reduces the addition of unnecessary noise, and at the same time, the model has a good effect. Experimental results on real-world data show that our proposed algorithm can effectively protect data privacy.  © 2021 Lina Ni et al.

AB  - As a result of modern progress, the usage of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in the medical field has gotten considerable interest. WSNs are implemented to gather and transmit patient physiological data in healthcare management systems. Therefore, authentication and patient data privacy are two major challenges in the healthcare system. Thus, some cryptographic mechanisms are applied to secure the transmission of physiological data collected by the wearable sensors using bilinear pairing. However, the bilinear pairing is considered high computational. This paper provides a practical and efficient certificateless signcryption scheme with free pairing to secure communication between the sensors and the remote control system. Also, signcryption is employed to meet the main security requirements such as confidentiality, non-repudiation, integrity, and authentication. Besides, under the Computational Diffie-hellman assumption and the Discrete logarithm problem in the random oracle model, this protocol is shown to meet unforgeability and confidentiality. Finally, as shown in the security analysis, our protocol is secure and practical.  © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - With innovation in persistent technologies, such as wearable sensor gadgets, sensor devices, and wireless ad-hoc communication networks connect everyday life things to the Internet, normally referred to as Internet of Things (IoT). IoT is observed as an active entity for design and development of smart and context awareness services and applications in the area of business, science and engineering discipline. These applications and services could vigorously respond to the surroundings transformation and users’ preference. Developing a scalable system for data analysis, processing and mining of enormous real world based datasets has turned into one of the demanding problems that faces both system research scholars and data management research scholars. Employing big data analytics with IoT technologies is one of the ways for handling the timely analyzing information (i.e., data, events) streams. In this paper, we propose an integrated approach that coalesce IoT systems with big data tools into a holistic platform for real-time and continuous data monitoring and processing. We propose Fog assisted IoT based Smart and real time healthcare information processing (SRHIP) system in which large amounts of data generated by IoT sensor devices are offloaded at Fog cloud form data analytics and processing with minimum delay. The processed data is then transferred to a centralized cloud system for further analysis and storage. In this work, we introduce a Fog-assisted model with big data environment for data analytic of real time data with remote monitoring and discuss our plan for evaluating its efficacy in terms of several performance metrics such as transmission cost, storage cost, accuracy, specificity, sensitivity and F-measure. The proposed SRHIP system needs less transmission cost of 40.10% in comparison to SPPDA, 100% fewer bytes are compromised in comparison to GCEDA. Our proposed system data size reduction of 60% reduction due to proposed compression scheme in comparison to other benchmark strategies that offer 40% of reduction. © 2020

AB  - Machine Learning (ML) and especially Deep Learning (DL) models have been already proven successful in automated or assisted decision-making support in multiple domains. This is particularly evident in the data-intensive domains, such as the clinical practice. In this paper, we provide a systematic view of using ML/DL approaches in orthopedic rehabilitation (predicting success, wearable sensors), remote monitoring and rehabilitation follow-up (including the assessment). Furthermore, in the effort to provide sensible and complete guidelines for using the ML/DL in the field in the future, we identify the characteristic features of data (used for training and testing algorithms) and algorithms themselves. Finally, we identify data privacy, data integration and liability as the current challenges for increasing the pace of implementing the use of ML/DL methods in remote monitoring and assistance in orthopedic rehabilitation. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.

AB  - Background: The use of wearable sensor technology to collect patient health data, such as gait and physical activity, offers the potential to transform healthcare research. To maximise the use of wearable devices in practice, it is important that they are usable by, and offer value to, all stakeholders. Although previous research has explored participants’ opinions of devices, to date, limited studies have explored the experiences and opinions of the researchers who use and implement them. Researchers offer a unique insight into wearable devices as they may have access to multiple devices and cohorts, and thus gain a thorough understanding as to how and where this area needs to progress. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the experiences and opinions of researchers from academic, industry and clinical contexts, in the use of wearable devices to measure gait and physical activity. Methods: Twenty professionals with experience using wearable devices in research were recruited from academic, industry and clinical backgrounds. Independent, semi-structured interviews were conducted, audio-recorded and transcribed. Transcribed texts were analysed using inductive thematic analysis. Results: Five themes were identified: (1) The positives and negatives of using wearable devices in research, (2) The routine implementation of wearable devices into research and clinical practice, (3) The importance of compromise in protocols, (4) Securing good quality data, and (5) A paradigm shift. Researchers overwhelmingly supported the use of wearable sensor technology due to the insights that they may provide. Though barriers remain, researchers were pragmatic towards these, believing that there is a paradigm shift happening in this area of research that ultimately requires mistakes and significant volumes of further research to allow it to progress. Conclusions: Multiple barriers to the use of wearable devices in research and clinical practice remain, including data management and clear clinical utility. However, researchers strongly believe that the potential benefit of these devices to support and create new clinical insights for patient care, is greater than any current barrier. Multi-disciplinary research integrating the expertise of both academia, industry and clinicians is a fundamental necessity to further develop wearable devices and protocols that match the varied needs of all stakeholders. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Mobile applications provide the healthcare industry with a means of connecting with patients in their own home utilizing their own personal mobile devices such as tablets and phones. This allows therapists to monitor the progress of people under their care from a remote location and all with the added benefit that patients are familiar with their own mobile devices; thereby reducing the time required to train patients with the new technology. There is also the added benefit to the health service that there is no additional cost required to purchase devices for use. The Facial Remote Activity Monitoring Eyewear (FRAME) mobile application and web service framework has been designed to work on the IOS and android platforms, the two most commonly used today. Results: The system utilizes secure cloud based data storage to collect, analyse and store data, this allows for near real time, secure access remotely by therapists to monitor their patients and intervene when required. The underlying framework has been designed to be secure, anonymous and flexible to ensure compliance with the data protection act and the latest General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR); this new standard came into effect in April 2018 and replaces the Data Protection Act in the UK and Europe. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Innovative ways of healthcare delivery like m-Health, the practice of medicine by mobile devices and wearable devices are the promising new technique that may lead to improvement in quality of care at lower costs. While fully acknowledging the importance of m-Health development, there are challenges on privacy legislation. We address the legal framework, especially the General Data Protection Regulation, applied to m-Health and its implications for m-Health developments in Europe. We discuss how these rules are applied using a representative example of an m-Health programme with remote monitoring in the Netherlands. We consider informing patients about the data processing and obtaining their explicit consent as main responsibilities of healthcare providers introducing m-Health in their practice.  © 2020 Author(s) (or their employer(s)).

AB  - Purpose of review Telemedicine has quickly become an essential part of modern healthcare, particularly in the management of chronic conditions like inflammatory bowel disease. The purpose of this review is to describe the current use of telehealth, mobile applications and wearable devices in inflammatory bowel disease and potential future applications. Recent findings Telemedicine was increasingly used during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic. Virtual consultations allowed clinical care to continue despite pandemic-related restrictions without compromising the quality of care for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It also benefits patients who would not have access to care due to financial or geographical barriers. Mobile applications allow patients with IBD to record disease activity among other metrics, allowing for earlier healthcare provider intervention. Wearable devices are increasingly being explored to monitor physiological indicators of disease activity and flare. Summary Telehealth and remote patient monitoring has been successfully integrated into the care of IBD patients. The advantages of these modalities include better access to specialist care and remote noninvasive disease monitoring. Careful consideration must be given to patient privacy, data protection and equitable access. These modalities have enormous potential to improve patient care through accurate consistent data collection and even the prediction of disease activity. Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - Secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD), the leading cause of morbidity and mortality, is critical to improving health outcomes and quality of life in our aging population. As mobile health (mHealth) technology gains universal leverage and popularity, it is becoming more user-friendly for older adults and an adjunct to manage CVD risk and improve overall cardiovascular health. With the rapid advances in mHealth technology and increasing technological engagement of older adults, a comprehensive understanding of the current literature and knowledge of gaps and barriers surrounding the impact of mHealth on secondary CVD prevention is essential. After a systematic review of the literature, 26 studies that used mHealth for secondary CVD prevention focusing on lifestyle behavior change and medication adherence in cohorts with a mean age of ≥60 years were identified. Improvements in health behaviors and medication adherence were observed, particularly when there was a short message service (ie, texting) component involved. Although mobile technologies are becoming more mainstream and are starting to blend more seamlessly with standard health care, there are still distinct barriers that limit implementation particularly in older adults, including affordability, usability, privacy, and security issues. Furthermore, studies on the type of mHealth that is the most effective for older adults with longer study duration are essential as the field continues to grow. As our population ages, identifying and implementing effective, widely accepted, cost-effective, and time-efficient mHealth interventions to improve CVD health in a vulnerable demographic group should be a top health priority. © 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

AB  - Objective: Digital devices have demonstrated benefits to patients with chronic and neurodegenerative diseases. But when patients use medical devices in their homes, the technologies have to fit into their lives. We investigated the technology acceptance of seven digital devices for home use. Methods: We conducted 60 semi-structured interviews with participants of a larger device study on their views on the acceptability of seven devices. Transcriptions were analysed using qualitative content analysis. Results: Based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology, we evaluated effort, facilitating conditions, performance expectancy and social influence of each device. In the effort category, five themes emerged: (a) the hassle to use the device; (b) its usability; (c) comfort; (d) disturbance to daily life; and (e) problems during usage. Facilitating conditions consisted of five themes: (a) expectations regarding a device; (b) quality of the instructions; (c) insecurities with usage; (d) possibilities of optimization; and (e) possibilities to use the device longer. Regarding performance expectancy, we identified three themes: (a) insecurities with the performance of a device; (b) feedback; and (c) motivation for using a device. In the social influence category, three themes emerged: (a) reactions of peers; (b) concerns with the visibility of a device; and (c) concerns regarding data privacy. Conclusions: We identify key factors that determine the acceptability of medical devices for home use from the participants’ perspective. These include low effort of use, minor disruptions to their daily lives and good support from the study team. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - New emerging technologies in today’s world play a vital role in each and every sector. In health sector, also a lot of research work is going on to transform the traditional health sector into a digital health sector with the help of these new technologies. And the biggest step toward this transformation in health care is remote patient monitoring (RPM). Remote patient monitoring (RPM) is the most powerful tool to observe the patients effectively at any time. RPM allows the healthcare providers to get the real-time monitoring of the patients with the help of sensors, wearable devices, smart phones, etc. Data is a new fuel of twenty-first century, with the implementation of different new technologies in various fields the legitimate concern of data security and privacy of the users is also arise which has to be resolved for maintain the trust of the users. And this research acknowledges this concern seriously and efficiently. The objective of this research is to enhance the security of the data of patients with the help of RSA by preventing the malicious data infusion in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) used in remote patient monitoring architecture, to maintain the integrity and authenticity of data by en-route filtering using RSA and to enhance the efficiency of overall system by minimum use of energy with the help of AODV protocol. The proposed enhance security mechanism is simulated using NS2 simulator. This research work provides a path to move a step further in transforming the health sector when dealing with the legitimate concern of data protection simultaneously. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2023.

AB  - Consumer sleep technology (CST) is at the core of the ongoing Internet of Things digital health revolution, with about one-third of the US population reporting regular use of CST wearables to track sleep, physical activity, and other health-related indicators. Wearables provides a low-cost and technologically advanced approach to measure sleep over time in free-living conditions, with miniaturized sensors, wireless data transfer protocols, mobile- and cloud-based platform for data management and visualization, and easy integration with other services. The unprecedented amount of data generated by CST has the potential to improve our understanding of sleep and its disorders in natural settings, providing insight into the relationship between sleep, behavior, and health. In parallel with the growing utilization of telemedicine, remote patient monitoring is becoming increasingly relevant in medicine and therefore, the use of CST will likely augment the diagnosis and management of sleep disorders. The ownership of CST by the patient, as opposed to the health system, allows for sleep tracking to take place prior to and between patient-provider interactions, which could transform the current framework of sleep medicine care delivery. Additionally, the use of CST alongside the recording of other health-metrics with digital tools (e.g., blood pressure cuffs, scales, glucometers, mobile apps for symptoms tracking) may ultimately reveal the interactions between sleep and patient comorbidities (e.g., hypertension, diabetes) in ambulatory settings. Despite this potential, CST is largely unregulated and has yet-unsolved intrinsic limitations inherent to a consumer-oriented product. For example, CST lacks major requirements of traditional clinical/research tools, including transparency in the algorithms used, control of, and access to raw data. The scientific community has been actively examining the performance of CST, considering these limitations, and continues to provide guidance on how to move forward with CST in basic and clinical sleep research. Here, we discuss performance, rationale, theoretical and practical guidelines for testing and using wearable CST. © 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved

AB  - In recent times, networking, information, and communication technologies are widely employed and getting spread in the area of medical applications. In a short period, real-time applications for healthcare monitoring produce a huge amount of data. Data is to be bursting in the case of critical applications; hence there is a greater need to enable reliable communication methods that ensure energy efficiency. A large amount of data results in high data transmission, network congestion, and latency, which in turn cause a hop increment between the IoT and cloud servers, and thus data might be unprocessed and insufficient for end-users. Since Fog computing is a distributed intermediate layer between the edge network and the cloud environment, latency can be reduced to a remarkable level, and the reliable communication can be achieved with the help of fog computing on IoT assisted wearable sensor platform. This research proposes a dynamic model for analysis and the Heuristic Hybrid Time Slot Fuzzy-Allocation Algorithm (HHTSF-AA), which improves health monitoring by indulging IoT assisted wearable sensor platform. Fog computing assisted wearable sensor platform is the most suitable and reliable platform for robust life-critical applications that are likely not to be delayed in communication. Besides, routing data packets are equipped with a low-cost energy minimum selection algorithm incorporated to improve the overall network performance. Dynamic slot assignment reduces time in a network and allows high levels of network capacity channel utilization. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The use of remote monitoring technology for cardiovascular electronic implantable devices has grown significantly in recent decades, yet several key questions remain about its integration into clinical care. We performed semi-structured interviews of patients, clinicians, and device clinic technicians involved in clinical remote monitoring of cardiovascular implantable devices at our institution. Twenty-eight interviews comprised of 15 patients and 13 clinicians were conducted from October 2019 through February 2020. Interview transcripts were analyzed using a mixed inductive and deductive approach. Perspectives among clinicians and patients varied regarding familiarity, educational experiences, and preferences regarding how remote monitoring data are handled. Three key domains emerged including knowledge and understanding, managing alerts, and cost transparency. Within these domains, key findings includedvery limited understanding of how remote monitoring functions and how alerts in particular are handled. These knowledge deficits (both patients and providers) appeared to arise in part from different equipment and platforms among manufacturers, the complexity of the technology, and lack of formalized education in remote monitoring. However, interviewees expressed generally high levels of trust in the technology and care systems supporting remote monitoring. Few respondents described concerns around cybersecurity, but patients in particular did raise concerns about cost transparency and frequent billing. In conclusion, conflicting perceptions around remote monitoring persist and indicate important knowledge gaps despite high trust in the care pathway. This qualitative analysis offers insight into patient and clinician understanding of and attitudes toward remote monitoring, and may guide future efforts to improve education and patient-centeredness of remote monitoring. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The wide use of wearable devices rises a lot of concerns about the privacy and security of personal data that are collected and stored by such services. This concern is even higher when such data is produced by healthcare monitoring wearable devices and thus the impact of any data leakage is more significant. In this work a classification of the wearable devices used for healthcare monitoring is conducted, and the most prominent relevant privacy and security issues and concerns are presented. Furthermore, a brief review of alternative approaches that can eliminate most of such issues, including federated learning, homomorphic encryption, and tinyML, is presented. The aim of this work is to present the privacy and security concerns in healthcare monitoring wearable devices, as well as some solutions in hot topics about these issues. © 2022, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.

AB  - During the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, different technologies, including telehealth, are maximised to mitigate the risks and consequences of the disease. Telehealth has been widely utilised because of its usability and safety in providing healthcare services during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, a systematic literature review which provides extensive evidence on the impact of COVID-19 through telehealth and which covers multiple directions in a large-scale research remains lacking. This study aims to review telehealth literature comprehensively since the pandemic started. It also aims to map the research landscape into a coherent taxonomy and characterise this emerging field in terms of motivations, open challenges and recommendations. Articles related to telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic were systematically searched in the WOS, IEEE, Science Direct, Springer and Scopus databases. The final set included (n = 86) articles discussing telehealth applications with respect to (i) control (n = 25), (ii) technology (n = 14) and (iii) medical procedure (n = 47). Since the beginning of the pandemic, telehealth has been presented in diverse cases. However, it still warrants further attention. Regardless of category, the articles focused on the challenges which hinder the maximisation of telehealth in such times and how to address them. With the rapid increase in the utilization of telehealth in different specialised hospitals and clinics, a potential framework which reflects the authors’ implications of the future application and opportunities of telehealth has been established. This article improves our understanding and reveals the full potential of telehealth during these difficult times and beyond. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - IoMT sensors such as wearables, moodables, ingestible sensors and trackers have the potential to provide a proactive approach to healthcare. But grouping, traversing and selectively tapping the IoMT data traffic and its immediacy makes data management & decision analysis a pressing issue. Evidently, the selection process for real-world, time-constrained health problems involves looking at multivariate time-series data generated simultaneously from various wearables resulting in data overload and accuracy issues. Computational intelligence of edge analytics can extend predictive capability by quickly turning digital biomarker data into actions for remote monitoring and trigger alarm during emergency incidents without relying on backend servers. But the pervasive generation of data streams from IoMT levies significant issues in data visualization and exploratory data analysis. This paper presents a genetically optimized Fuzzy C-means data clustering technique for affective state recognition on the edge. Clustering segregates the biomarker data in chunks and generates a summarized data for each subject which is then genetically optimized to avoid stagnation in local optima. A multi-level convolution neural network is finally used to classify the affective states into the baseline, stress and amusement categories. The model is evaluated on the publicly available WESAD dataset and compares favorably to state-of-the-art with less time complexity. It demonstrates the use of data clustering technique for numerosity reduction of real-time data streams in intelligent edge analytics which facilitates fast analysis of affective state of the user. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is a new paradigm in the IoT-based healthcare and medical applications which has brought many advantages to this. Increasing in the number of smart medical devices has led to security challenges within IoMT environments. Cryptography and other cuttingedge approaches have been widely used to mitigate the challenges and prevent sensitive data leakage. One of such approaches is the attribute-based encryption (ABE), which enables a fine-grained and flexible access control. However, the ABE does not provide a dynamic encryption mechanism when patients' conditions change over the period of remote monitoring. To address this, we present a novel security architecture for IoMT that relies on ciphertext policy attributebased encryption (CP-ABE). The architecture applies a dynamic access structure for the encryption in accordance with the status of the medical data collected by IoMT devices. We define some new components mainly hosted on the IoMT gateways in order to encrypt and decrypt the medical data in the architecture. An IoMT use case is presented to show how our proposed architecture supports dynamic encryption in ehealthcare systems.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Over the past several years, many healthcare applications have been developed to enhance the healthcare industry. Recent advancements in information technology and blockchain technology have revolutionized electronic healthcare research and industry. The innovation of miniaturized healthcare sensors for monitoring patient vital signs has improved and secured the human healthcare system. The increase in portable health devices has enhanced the quality of health-monitoring status both at an activity/fitness level for self-health tracking and at a medical level, providing more data to clinicians with potential for earlier diagnosis and guidance of treatment. When sharing personal medical information, data security and comfort are essential requirements for interaction with and collection of electronic medical records. However, it is hard for current systems to meet these requirements because they have inconsistent security policies and access control structures. The new solutions should be directed towards improving data access, and should be managed by the government in terms of privacy and security requirements to ensure the reliability of data for medical purposes. Blockchain paves the way for a revolution in the traditional pharmaceutical industry and benefits from unique features such as privacy and transparency of data. In this paper, we propose a novel platform for monitoring patient vital signs using smart contracts based on blockchain. The proposed system is designed and developed using hyperledger fabric, which is an enterprise-distributed ledger framework for developing blockchain-based applications. This approach provides several benefits to the patients, such as an extensive, immutable history log, and global access to medical information from anywhere at any time. The Libelium e-Health toolkit is used to acquire physiological data. The performance of the designed and developed system is evaluated in terms of transaction per second, transaction latency, and resource utilization using a standard benchmark tool known as Hyperledger Caliper. It is found that the proposed system outperforms the traditional health care system for monitoring patient data. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - mHealth apps developed for teleconsultation and telemonitoring include software that collect, store and exchange information on the health status of individuals to allow a remote medical examination and a remote monitoring of a patient suffering from a chronic disease. In recent years the phenomenon of mHealth apps has deeply been studied, but uncertainty remains. In the absence of a specific regime for telemedicine, this paper will reconstruct the applicable rules in the European Union and Italian legal systems and investigate whether such a mHealth app should be considered a medical device and what are the requirements deriving from the data protection framework. © 2021

AB  - Telediabetes may improve patient access to clinicians who specialize in the management of pediatric diabetes. Due to the diversity of telehealth modes, many different service models for pediatric telediabetes have been developed. This review describes pediatric telediabetes service models identified in the literature, investigates the reported changes in HbA1c of these interventions, and describes enablers and barriers to implementing a telediabetes service. Evaluation of current literature may inform the development and sustainability of telehealth services for pediatric diabetes management. Twenty-nine studies met inclusion criteria and were reviewed. This review has demonstrated that pediatric telediabetes can be delivered by remote monitoring and real-time videoconference modes. Overall, pediatric telediabetes increased interactions between patients and clinicians, improved access to specialized care, and facilitated increased diabetes monitoring. In some contexts, telediabetes also improved short-term glycemic control. Key enablers reported for telediabetes services were integration with existing workflows, dedicated staff, clinician and patient training, appropriate data security, technology with good usability, and the availability of technical support. Barriers included increases in patient responsibilities and clinician workload, and technical issues with equipment and software.  © Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2020.

AB  - Background: Cancer is likely to remain the most prevalent noncommunicable disease in high-income countries with an older population. Interestingly, no review of attitudes toward telemedicine among older adults has been performed. This is likely to be the group most affected by both cancer and the increasing use of technology in health care. Objective: We aimed to map research on the acceptance of telemedicine among older adults who are cancer patients. Methods: We conducted a scoping review. PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were systematically searched from inception to September 2020. Articles were included if the study population had a mean or median age ≥65 years, with cancer diagnoses and if the study assessed patients’ acceptance of a telemedicine intervention. Quantitative, qualitative, and mixed method studies were included. Results: Out of a total of 887 articles that were identified, 19 were included in the review. Interventions were delivered via telephone, videoconference, web portal, mobile app, wearable technology, and text messaging and included teleconsultation, monitoring and follow-up, psychosocial support and nursing care, and prompts. The most often cited facilitating factor was convenience. Other facilitators included an increase in telemedicine care accessibility, previous positive experiences of telemedicine, appropriate technical knowledge and support, decreased cost, physician recommendations, and privacy conferred by the telemedicine intervention. Barriers include a preference for conventional care along with negative perceptions of telemedicine, concerns about technical difficulties, and confidentiality concerns in the adoption of telemedicine. Conclusions: None of the studies explored the ability of tailored interventions to address facilitators and barriers of the acceptance of telemedicine in order to increase its adoption by older adults. Facilitators and barriers will likely differ across different cultural contexts and by type of telemedicine; however, this is a gap in current knowledge. In-depth studies are necessary to determine if interventions could potentially address the barriers identified in this review, to increase acceptability. © 2022 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

AB  - Sudden spurting of Corona virus disease (COVID-19) has put the whole healthcare system on high alert. Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has eased the situation to a great extent, also COVID-19 has motivated scientists to make new ‘Smart’ healthcare system focusing towards early diagnosis, prevention of spread, education and treatment and facilitate living in the new normal. This review aims to identify the role of IoMT applications in improving healthcare system and to analyze the status of research demonstrating effectiveness of IoMT benefits to the patient and healthcare system along with a brief insight into technologies supplementing IoMT and challenges faced in developing a smart healthcare system. An internet-based search in PUBMED, Google Scholar and IEEE Library for english language publications using relevant terms resulted in 987 articles. After screening title, abstract, and content related to IoMT in healthcare and excluding duplicate articles, 135 articles published in journal with impact factor ≥1 were eligible for inclusion. Also relevant articles from the references of the selected articles were considered. The habituation of IoMT and related technology has resolved several difficulties using remote monitoring, telemedicine, robotics, sensors etc. However mass adoption seems challenging due to factors like privacy and security of data, management of large amount of data, scalability and upgradation etc. Although ample knowledge has been compiled and exchanged, this structured systematic review will help the healthcare practitioners, policymakers/decision makers, scientists and researchers to gauge the applicability of IoMT in healthcare more efficiently. © 2021 Craniofacial Research Foundation

AB  - A new method for acquiring device information using optical character recognition (OCR) for remote monitoring of the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) device was developed in this study. The ECMO device used was the SP-200 (Terumo Corp.) because initially its information could not be directly acquired for remote monitoring. In addition, the data management system (DMS) is a software that runs on a tablet PC and can collectively manage and display device information. Therefore, we used the screen output of a tablet PC running DMS to acquire the device information of SP-200 with OCR.A Raspberry Pi 4 Model B was used to capture the laptop PC display output that displayed a DMS image and read the device information with OCR. The captured image was then processed with Raspberry Pi into an image suitable for OCR. By reading with OCR, it was possible to acquire device information from a device from which it was initially not possible to directly do so.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is becoming ubiquitous with a proliferation of smart medical devices and applications used in smart hospitals, smart-home based care, and nursing homes. It utilizes smart medical devices and cloud computing services along with core Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to sense patients' vital body parameters, monitor health conditions and generate multivariate data to support just-in-time health services. Mostly, this large amount of data is analyzed in centralized servers. Anomaly Detection (AD) in a centralized healthcare ecosystem is often plagued by significant delays in response time with high performance overhead. Moreover, there are inherent privacy issues associated with sending patients' personal health data to a centralized server, which may also introduce several security threats to the AD model, such as possibility of data poisoning. To overcome these issues with centralized AD models, here we propose a Federated Learning (FL) based AD model which utilizes edge cloudlets to run AD models locally without sharing patients' data. Since existing FL approaches perform aggregation on a single server which restricts the scope of FL, in this paper, we introduce a hierarchical FL that allows aggregation at different levels enabling multi-party collaboration. We introduce a novel disease-based grouping mechanism where different AD models are grouped based on specific types of diseases. Furthermore, we develop a new Federated Time Distributed (FEDTIMEDIS) Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) approach to train the AD model. We present a Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) use case to demonstrate our model, and illustrate a proof-of-concept implementation using Digital Twin (DT) and edge cloudlets.  © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - The recent pandemic with SARS-CoV-2 raises questions worldwide regarding telemedicine for housebound patients, including those with cardiovascular conditions. The need for further investigation, monitoring and therapeutic management are advancing practical issues which had not been identified for consideration prior to the pandemic. Using the marketing assessment, we identified the needs of the patients and evaluated the future steps necessary in the short term to meet them. The research found progress made via telemedicine in monitoring and conducting minor decisions (like up-titrating the doses of different medication regimens) in patients with several cardiovascular diseases (heart failure, atrial fibrillation, high blood pressure), as there is a worldwide trend to develop new telemonitoring biosensors and devices based on implantable delivered transcatheter. The worldwide telemedicine trend encourages a switch from small and hesitating steps to a more consistent assessment of the patients, based on high technology and Interventional Cardiology. Cardiovascular telemedicine, although made a sustainable effort in managing patients' health, has many obstacles to overcome before meeting all their needs. Data security, confidentiality and reimbursement are the top priorities in developing remote Cardiology. The regulatory institutions need to play an integrative role in leading the way for defining the framework of future telemedicine activities. The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak with all its tragedy served to reinforce the message that telemedicine services can be life-saving for cardiovascular patients. Once the Covid-19 era will fade away, telemedicine is likely to remain a complementary service of standard care. There is still room to improve the remote identification and investigation of heart disease, provide an accurate diagnosis and therapeutic regimen, and update regulations and guidelines to the new realities of technological progress in the field.

AB  - Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, health services around the globe are struggling. An effective system for monitoring patients can improve healthcare delivery by avoiding in-person contacts, enabling early-detection of severe cases, and remotely assessing patients’ status. Internet of Things (IoT) technologies have been used for monitoring patients’ health with wireless wearable sensors in different scenarios and medical conditions, such as noncommunicable and infectious diseases. Combining IoT-related technologies with early-warning scores (EWS) commonly utilized in infirmaries has the potential to enhance health services delivery significantly. Specifically, the NEWS-2 has been showing remarkable results in detecting the health deterioration of COVID-19 patients. Although the literature presents several approaches for remote monitoring, none of these studies proposes a customized, complete, and integrated architecture that uses an effective early-detection mechanism for COVID-19 and that is flexible enough to be used in hospital wards and at home. Therefore, this article's objective is to present a comprehensive IoT-based conceptual architecture that addresses the key requirements of scalability, interoperability, network dynamics, context discovery, reliability, and privacy in the context of remote health monitoring of COVID-19 patients in hospitals and at home. Since remote monitoring of patients at home (essential during a pandemic) can engender trust issues regarding secure and ethical data collection, a consent management module was incorporated into our architecture to provide transparency and ensure data privacy. Further, the article details mechanisms for supporting a configurable and adaptable scoring system embedded in wearable devices to increase usefulness and flexibility for health care professions working with EWS. © 2021
