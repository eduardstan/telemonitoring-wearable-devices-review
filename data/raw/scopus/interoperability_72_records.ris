AB  - In the age of intelligent gadgets and interconnected communities, the widespread surveillance and provision of healthcare to patients are made feasible through the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). The number of implanted electronic devices that can be monitored remotely is increasing, leading to a rise in the amount and intricacy of biological data. The collected data can offer valuable diagnostic information that can be used to intervene and maintain implanted devices promptly, therefore enhancing the quality of treatment provided. Current remote monitoring processes are not fully using device diagnostics because of the lack of compatibility and data integration between exclusive applications and Digital Health Record (DHR) platforms. Establishing a technology framework that establishes information and enhances interoperability has the potential to strengthen remote monitoring. This article introduces the Medical Data Integration and Interoperability via Remote Monitoring of Healthcare Devices (MDII-RMHD) framework, which facilitates the collaboration of healthcare devices. MDII-RMHD enhances a cloud-based IoMT system using conversion resources at the network's boundary. This is achieved through the use of inquiring and conversion agents. The investigating devices keep track of a list of MDII-RMHD devices on the regional network and allow one device to seek information conversion from another gadget when the requesting device cannot do the task independently. The converting agent transforms the data into the necessary format and returns it to the original entity. These agents enable IoMT devices to utilize their surplus computational capabilities for data translations, reducing the need for cloud access. Conventional devices are compatible with fog resource managers that have MDII-RMHD support. We assess the MDII-RMHD framework by rigorous experimentation under different scenarios. The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed framework decreases the amount of uplink traffic and enhances the response time. This improvement in response time is significant for real-time healthcare applications. © 2024, Innovative Information Science and Technology Research Group. All rights reserved.

AB  - In modern healthcare systems, medical devices are playing a major role which involves personalized medical devices which improve the patient's lifestyle as they can be remotely monitored and their data are transmissible. Due to these data transmissions, the number of connections to the existing computer networks is increased. Being interoperable and interconnected these personalized medical devices provide great benefits like improved sensing capabilities and actuating capabilities. But the problem with high connectivity computer networks is that it exposes medical device to high cybersecurity vulnerabilities. The main targets are the pacemakers and institutions like hospitals and clinics. Hackers can easily hack medical devices and change prescriptions. So a cybersecurity breach can leak a patient's sensitive and confidential data and risk the patient's life. To prevent these multifaceted problems from happening these problems must be viewed from a systematic perspective and requires governance, technical controls, regulation, and standards.

AB  - IoT sensors offer a wide range of sensing capabilities, many of which have potential health applications. Existing solutions for IoT in healthcare have notable limitations, such as closed-source, limited I/O protocols, limited cloud platform support, and missing specific functionality for health use cases. Developing an open-source internet of things (IoT) gateway solution that addresses these limitations and provides reliability, broad applicability, and utility is highly desirable. Combining a wide range of sensor data streams from IoT devices with ambulatory mHealth data would open up the potential to provide a detailed 360-degree view of the relationship between patient physiology, behavior, and environment. We have developed RADAR-IoT as an open-source IoT gateway framework, to harness this potential. It aims to connect multiple IoT devices at the edge, perform limited on-device data processing and analysis, and integrate with cloud-based mobile health platforms, such as RADAR-base, enabling real-time data processing. We also present a proof-of-concept data collection from this framework, using prototype hardware in two locations. The RADAR-IoT framework, combined with the RADAR-base mHealth platform, provides a comprehensive view of a user’s health and environment by integrating static IoT sensors and wearable devices. Despite its current limitations, it offers a promising open-source solution for health research, with potential applications in managing infection control, monitoring chronic pulmonary disorders, and assisting patients with impaired motor control or cognitive ability. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - In this work, we propose and develop healthcare device interoperability (HeDI) - a system to enable device interoperability in IoT-enabled in-home healthcare monitoring platforms. The system consists of multiple sensors, each connected wirelessly to an edge device, acting as a wireless communication gateway to a remote server. The system initiates information handshaking between the sensor adapters and edge device at the beginning of the operation, which is later used to detect the sensor settings to process the data received from the sensor. The system is scalable and dynamically accommodates multiple sensors without any predefined ontologies at the edge device. The implementation of our system avoids dependencies on a system's physical ports. The low form factor and wireless connectivity of the adapter make the system portable and convenient for in-home health monitoring. Additionally, the system allows multiple homogeneous sensors to operate at the same time in the same system. We implement and evaluate our system with a 3-lead ECG, pulse, and temperature sensors against two different network configurations - star and mesh. We use the data set generated from our implemented system for performance analysis. The network-level analysis of our system shows an average packet delivery ratio of 0.92 for star network configuration and 0.98 for mesh network configuration, ensuring the reliability of performance and its suitability for healthcare monitoring systems.  © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Hypertension is a noncommunicable disease (NCD) that causes global concern, high costs and a high number of deaths. Internet of Things, Ubiquitous Computing, and Cloud Computing enable the development of systems for remote and real-time monitoring of patients affected with NCDs like hypertension. This paper reports on a system for monitoring hypertension patients that was built by employing these techniques. This system allows the vital signs of a patient (blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature) to be captured via sensors built in a wearable device similar to a wristwatch. These signals are transmitted to the patient's mobile device for processing, and the generated clinical data are sent to the cloud to be properly presented and analysed by the health professionals responsible for the patient. To deal with semantic interoperability issues that arise when multiple different devices and system components must interoperate, a semantic model was conceived for this system in terms of ontologies for diseases and devices. This paper also presents the semantic module that we developed and implemented in the cloud to perform reasoning based on this model, demonstrating the potential benefits of incorporating semantic technologies in our system.

AB  - The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has emerged as a paradigm shift in healthcare, integrating the Internet of Things (IoT) with medical devices, sensors, and healthcare systems. From peripheral devices that monitor vital signs to remote patient monitoring systems and smart hospitals, IoMT provides a vast array of applications that empower healthcare professionals. However, the integration of IoMT presents numerous obstacles, such as data security, privacy concerns, interoperability, scalability, and ethical considerations. For the successful integration and deployment of IoMT, addressing these obstacles is essential. Federated Learning (FL) permits collaborative model training while maintaining data privacy in distributed environments like IoMT. By incorporating Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, the resulting models become more interpretable and transparent, enabling healthcare professionals to comprehend the underlying decision-making processes. This integration not only improves the credibility of Artificial Intelligence models but also facilitates the detection of biases, errors, and peculiar patterns in the data. The combination of FL and XAI contributes to the development of more privacy-preserving, trustworthy, and explainable AI systems, which are essential for the development of dependable and ethically sound IoMT applications. Hence, the aim of this paper is to conduct a literature review on the amalgamation of FL and XAI for IoMT. © 2024 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has created a wide range of opportunities for knowledge exchange in numerous industries. The opportunities include patient empowerment, healthcare collaboration, medical education and training, remote monitoring and telemedicine, customized treatment plans, data sharing for innovation, continuous medical learning, supply chain management, public health initiatives, wearable health devices, and quality improvement initiatives. However, the adoption of IoMT faces numerous challenges regarding interoperability, data privacy, security, regulatory, and infrastructure costs. This paper aims to address the implications of data fusion in IoMT, as well as the associated security challenges and their potential solutions, which are lacking in the literature. Data collected from IoMT devices has a direct impact on the accuracy of predictions because of its quality, quantity, and relevance. With an accuracy of 99.53 % to 99.99 %, the Epilepsy seizure detector-based Naive Bayes (ESDNB) algorithm is found to be the most effective for detecting epileptic seizures in IoMT networks. However, the way data are stored must also undergo a major revolution, and all phases—collection, protection, and storage—need to be improved. The standardization of architecture and security measures may improve the detection of security threats and compromises. Methods to detect malware in cross platforms is also an avenue for future research that can effectively tackle the heterogeneity of the IoMT systems. Cryptography and blockchain technology have shown to be promising ways to increase the security of an IoMT-based system. The findings of this review will assist a wide variety of stakeholders in the healthcare ecosystem. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - Purpose: The aim of the study is to assess the experiences, barriers, and expectations regarding current patient monitoring systems among intensive care unit nurses at one university hospital. Methods: A qualitative exploratory study approach was adopted to test the research questions. Results: Intensive care unit personnel placed a high value on practical criteria such as user friendliness and visualization while assessing the present monitoring system. Poor alarm handling was recognized as possible patient safety hazards. The necessity of high accessibility was highlighted once again for a prospective system; wireless, noninvasive, and interoperability of monitoring devices were requested; and smart phones for distant patient monitoring and alert management improvement were required. Conclusion: Core comments from ICU personnel are included in this qualitative research on patient monitoring. All national healthcare involved parties must focus more on user-derived insights to ensure a speedy and effective introduction of digital health technologies in the ICU. The findings from the alarm control or mobile device studies might be utilized to train ICU personnel to use new technology, minimize alarm fatigue, increase medical device accessibility, and develop interoperability standards in critical care practice. 2024 Rayan, Al-Ghabeesh, Fawaz, Behar and Toumi.

AB  - Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) consists of connected devices used to collect patient health information in a real-time environment. The IoMT device effectively handles medical issues by using health wearable and medical-grade wearables. Although IoMT can process the collected data, it has few pitfalls, such as interoperability of data, standardization issues, and computation complexity while detecting disease. By considering these issues, in this work, IoMT is utilized in the field of the remote patient monitoring system. Initially, the IoMT devices are placed on the human body and collect their health information continuously. The gathered details are processed using a salp swarm optimized fuzzy deep neural network (SS-FD). This system supports the patient health monitoring process with minimum low-cost consumption. The SS-FD classifier processes the obtained data; primary and emergency data is classified according to the fuzzy rule. This process improves the remote patient health data analysis and reduces the difficulties involved in the patient health analysis. Then the efficiency of the system is evaluated using experimental results. © 2021. The Author. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - In recent times, the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has emerged as one of humanity’s most helpful technological gifts. With incredible development in data sciences, big data technologies, and embedded systems, today, it is possible to collect a huge amount of healthcare-related sensitive and personal data and store and compile it through cloud or edge computing scenarios. Sensor-based devices connected with the patient can capture body vitals like heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen levels, thus providing broader scope for remote patient monitoring of chronic or long-term conditions, tracking patient medication orders, and even tracking the mobility pattern and location of patients. Further, healthcare-related wearable devices can be configured to send emergency information to caregivers. When these IoMT-based devices are connected and configured with the patient healthcare monitoring system or hospital system, they are expected to provide effective assistance towards the decision-making process required for the treatment. This book chapter intends to discuss the basic concepts associated with IoMT and review the current state of the Internet of Things applied to healthcare and medical technologies and focus on an application based on IoMT. Recently, this field has seen exponential growth in terms of products and research at different levels, such as sensors, networks, and repositories. This chapter further focuses on application based on location tracking of movable healthcare base sensor devices, data acquisition from those devices, and efficient processing for decision-making. Lastly, the authors are also interested to include a case study based on the mentioned application. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Background: Population growth and aging have highlighted the need for more effective home and prehospital care. Interconnected medical devices and applications, which comprise an infrastructure referred to as the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), have enabled remote patient monitoring and can be important tools to cope with these demographic changes. However, developing IoMT platforms requires profound knowledge of clinical needs and challenges related to interoperability and how these can be managed with suitable technologies. Objective: The purpose of this scoping review is to summarize the best practices and technologies to overcome interoperability concerns in IoMT platform development for medical emergencies in home and prehospital care. Methods: This scoping review will be conducted in accordance with Arksey and O'Malley's 5-stage framework and adhere to the PRISMA-P (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses Protocols) guidelines. Only peer-reviewed articles published in English will be considered. The databases/web search engines that will be used are IEEE Xplore, PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, National Center for Biotechnology Information, SAGE Journals, and ScienceDirect. The search process for relevant literature will be divided into 4 different steps. This will ensure that a suitable approach is followed in terms of search terms, limitations, and eligibility criteria. Relevant articles that meet the inclusion criteria will be screened in 2 stages: abstract and title screening and full-text screening. To reduce selection bias, the screening process will be performed by 2 reviewers. Results: The results of the preliminary search indicate that there is sufficient literature to form a good foundation for the scoping review. The search was performed in April 2022, and a total of 4579 articles were found. The main clinical focus is the prevention and management of falls, but other medical emergencies, such as heart disease and stroke, are also considered. Preliminary results show that little attention has been given to real-time IoMT platforms that can be deployed in real-world care settings. The final results are expected to be presented in a scoping review in 2023 and will be disseminated through scientific conference presentations, oral presentations, and publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Conclusions: This scoping review will provide insights and recommendations regarding how interoperable real-time IoMT platforms can be developed to handle medical emergencies in home and prehospital care. The findings of this research could be used by researchers, clinicians, and implementation teams to facilitate future development and interdisciplinary discussions. © JMIR Publications Inc..

AB  - eHealth is the use of modern information and communication technology (ICT) for trans-institutional healthcare purposes. Important subtopics of eHealth are health data sharing and telemedicine. Most of the clinical documentation to be shared is collected in patient records to support patient care. More sophisticated approaches to electronic patient records are trans-institutional or (inter-)national. Other aims for clinical documentation are quality management, reimbursement, legal issues, and medical research. Basic prerequisite for eHealth is interoperability, which can be divided into technical, semantic and process interoperability. There is a variety of international standards to support interoperability. Telemedicine is a subtopic of eHealth, which bridges spatial distance by using ICT for medical (inter-)actions. We distinguish telemedicine among healthcare professionals and telemedicine between health care professionals and patients. Both have a great potential to face the challenges of aging societies, the increasing number of chronically ill patients, multimorbidity and low number of physicians in remote areas. With ongoing digitalization more and more data are available digitally. Clinical documentation is an important source for big data analysis and artificial intelligence. The patient has an important role: Telemonitoring, wearable technologies, and smart home devices provide digital health data from daily life. These are high-quality data which can be used for medical decisions. © 2020 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - The fourth industrial revolution (4IR or Industry 4.0), its communication and information enabling technologies are revolutionizing the production and services applications. In the healthcare domain, electronic health (eHealth) is evolving towards healthcare 4.0 through the Internet of things, big data analytics, Cloud and Fog computing technologies. There is need for early cancer detection, which can be achieved by new imaging technologies for example Terahertz imaging and Infrared thermography. The integration of such new imaging modalities and wearable sensor networks with computer aided diagnosis systems (CAD) and IoT systems with interconnectivity and interoperability could enable continuous, remote observation of cancer diagnosed patients by experts to monitor the success of treatment procedures, side effects of drugs, statistical analysis and making predictions of cancer based on age and demographics etc. for timely intervention and personalized care. In the healthcare 4.0 paradigm, there is need not only for smart diagnosis but also care through remote patient monitoring. The vital signs associated with cancer and clinical information can be integrated to make the system culminate into a smart system with health records. This work proposes an IoT enabled deep learning framework for classification of breast images; we propose the development of both custom CNN model and fine-tuned, pretrained CNN models capable of multimodal image classification. IoT simulation and cloud processing is performed in the ThingSpeak cloud platform with email alert capability. The performance of the CNN models has been evaluated using the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity metrics which achieved 98.44%, 98.44% and 98.45% respectively for the custom CNN model together with the receiver operating characteristics curves and confusion matrices. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The pandemic necessitated the rapid design, development and implementation of technologies to allow remote monitoring of COVID-19 patients at home. This study aimed to explore the environmental barriers and facilitators to the successful development and implementation of virtual care technologies in this fast-paced context. We interviewed eight staff at a virtual hospital in Australia. We found key facilitators to be a learning organizational culture and strong leadership support. Barriers included interoperability issues, legislative constraints and unrealistic clinician expectations. Also, we found that a combination of hot-desking and the lack of single sign on in the virtual care environment, was reported to create additional work for staff. Overall, despite this unique context, our findings are consistent with prior work examining design and implementation of healthcare technologies. The fast pace and high-pressure environment appeared to magnify previously reported barriers, but also cultivate and foster a learning culture.  © 2024 International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) and IOS Press.

Then, real-time artificial intelligence systems may analyze the data for quicker diagnosis, better treatment, and better results. AI-enhanced predictive analytics may help doctors identify patterns and trends in patient data for early diagnosis, risk assessment, and prevention. Machine learning algorithms can predict disease development, adjust medication dosages, and identify potential adverse events to enhance patient safety and treatment efficacy. However, healthcare AI and IoT use raises concerns that must be addressed. The massive volumes of patient data collected and transferred pose data security and privacy concerns. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and patient privacy must be observed. Data integration, standardization, and compatibility are some of the technical challenges of IoT device and AI system integration. Healthcare firms need robust infrastructure and data management to network, share data, and collaborate across devices and systems. Finally, AI and IoT technologies may enhance patient care and monitoring in the healthcare business. AI algorithms fordata analysis and IoT devices for real-time data collection may help doctors diagnose, treat, and monitor patients remotely. Data security, privacy, and interoperability must be addressed to deploy AI and IoT in health care. AI and IoT might transform healthcare and enhance patient outcomes despite these challenges.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Patients with chronic illnesses account for three-quarters of health care costs in the United States. For many patients, chronic conditions such as diabetes, coronary heart disease, and neurological disorders significantly affect their health-related quality of life (HQoL). Recent advances in wearable and ambient sensors and mobile health (mHealth) technologies have enabled remote monitoring of patient health and their symptoms thereby enhancing effective self-management of chronic conditions and improvement in patient HQoL. This paper presents a comprehensive review of recent trends and challenges in designing smart and pervasive health systems for monitoring patients with chronic illnesses. Recent work in developing wearable sensors and mHealth technologies for managing a variety of chronic diseases such as coronary heart disease, hypertension, and Parkinson’s disease is described in detail. The article addresses various research gaps in security, energy optimization, scalability, and interoperability. The paper concludes with future research directions and recommendations in user centric design, closed loop systems, value based treatment, signal processing, and device level research for efficient design and adoption of smart and pervasive health systems. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

AB  - Modern Smart Health Systems (SHS) involve the concept of connected personal medical devices. These devices significantly improve the patient's lifestyle as they permit remote monitoring and transmission of health data (i.e., telemedicine), lowering the treatment costs for both the patient and the healthcare providers. Although specific SHS communication standards (i.e., ISO/IEEE 11073) enable real-time plug-and-play interoperability and communication between different personal medical devices, they do not specify any features for secure communications. In this paper, we demonstrate how personal medical device communication is indeed vulnerable to different cyber attacks. Specifically, we show how an external attacker can hook into the personal medical device's communication and eavesdrop the sensitive health data traffic, and implement manin-the-middle, replay, false data injection, and denial-of-service attacks. Furthermore, we also propose an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), HEKA, to monitor personal medical device traffic and detect attacks on them. HEKA passively hooks into the personal medical traffic generated by medical devices to learn the contiguous sequence of packets information from the captured traffic and detects irregular traffic-flow patterns using an n-grambased approach and different machine learning techniques. We implemented HEKA in a testbed consisting of eight off-the-shelf personal medical devices and evaluated its performance against four different attacks. Our extensive evaluation shows that HEKA can effectively detect different attacks on personal medical devices with an accuracy of 98.4% and Fl-score of 98%. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - The healthcare industry has undergone revolutionary changes as technology has advanced in recent years. The Internet of Things, Cloud Computing, Blockchain technology, lab-on-a-chip, non-invasive and minimally invasive operations, and other advancements have made it easier to treat a variety of debilitating ailments These new technologies have had a significant impact on both research and the healthcare business. Miniaturized healthcare sensors powered by IoT can be used for clinical tests and self-health tracking. They aid professionals in remote regions in making early diagnoses and treatment recommendations without having direct contact with users. Access control mechanisms and uneven security rules have made it difficult to meet the data's security standards. The patient's vital signs can be monitored using blockchain-based smart contracts and an enterprise-distributed ledger infrastructure. This offers global access to patient medical information at any moment, as well as an immutable and thorough history log. When compared to existing patient monitoring systems, the proposed approach provides more benefits. The blockchain system provides greater monitoring, increased connectivity, and higher data security when compared to traditional patient monitoring systems. Despite the abundance of medical facilities, fatal diseases such as heart disease, cancer, influenza, and pneumonia have increased significantly and claim many lives. A large number of doctors, therapists, nurses, and other personnel constantly monitor and observe patients' health. Patients with chronic diseases are regularly monitored and observed. In recent years, various healthcare monitoring systems have been introduced, and they are used to collect, process, and analyze data retrieved from sensing devices. These healthcare systems are also responsible for tracking and monitoring patients' vital signs. However, when connecting different departments of a hospital in order to effectively share medical data to provide better healthcare services to patients, the issue of legal interoperability arises. No such thing as a centralized system exists. A blockchain can address these problems using its decentralized architecture. Blockchain technology can be used to make his or her medical records unalterable and immutable. Any access or adjustment effort may be instantly labeled and identified across the blockchain. This is useful not just for patient integrity, but it also identifies any criminal activities, such as wholesale fraud or record adulteration. Furthermore, approved medicinal service record sharing and review will be greatly simplified. When a patient comes in, the majority of the patient's suppliers are usually notified immediately. Medication bugs, hypersensitivities, and drug solutions can be accommodated in overall blockchain records relatively quickly using appropriate patient-caring algorithms, removing the need for time-consuming pharmaceutical compromise forms. The use of blockchain technology will thus encourage improved access to care, medical record management, prompt clinical information confirmation, increased security, and more effective care planning for the effective delivery of healthcare services to patients through the management and sharing of medical data. Blockchain is transforming traditional healthcare practices into a more reliable means of effective diagnosis and treatment through safe and secure data sharing. In the future, blockchain could be a technology that can help with personalized, authentic, and secure healthcare by combining all of a patient's real-time clinical data and presenting it in an up-to-date secure healthcare setup. © 2023 River Publishers.

AB  - In this work, we propose SemBox - Semantic interoperability in a Box, to enable wireless on-the-go communication between heterogeneous wearable health monitoring devices. It can connect wirelessly to the health monitoring devices and receive their data packets. It uses a Mamdani-based fuzzy inference system with data pre-processing to classify the received data packet into one of the classes of the vital parameters. It enables semantic interoperability by labelling and annotating the data packets based on the extracted packet information. We implement SemBox using three different health monitoring wearables, with different keywords used for each vital parameter representation in the data packet. SemBox shows a maximum classification accuracy of 85.71%, with a maximum PDR of 1 at the SemBox with varying device parameters. Overall, SemBox is a potential plug-and-play solution to achieve semantic interoperability and collaboration between heterogeneous health monitoring wearable devices, irrespective of their commercial and proprietary specifications. It is customizable for applications that use multiple heterogeneous devices for collaborative monitoring and decision support. SemBox enables interoperability among health monitoring devices, introduces flexibility and ease the inter-device dynamics in the domain of biomedical research.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Biometric monitoring technologies (BioMeTs) have attracted the attention of the health care community because of their user-friendly form factor and multi-sensor data-collection capabilities. The potential benefits of remote monitoring for collecting comprehensive, longitudinal, and contextual datasets span therapeutic areas, and both chronic and acute disease settings. Importantly, multimodal BioMeTs unlock the ability to generate rich contextual data to augment digital measures. Currently, the availability of devices is no longer the main factor limiting adoption but rather the ability to integrate fit-for-purpose BioMeTs reliably and safely into clinical care. We provide a critical review of the state of art for multimodal BioMeTs in clinical care and identify three unmet clinical needs: 1) expand the abilities of existing ambulatory unimodal BioMeTs; 2) adapt standardized clinical test protocols ("spot checks'') for use under free living conditions; and 3) develop novel applications to manage rehabilitation and chronic diseases. As the field is still in an early and quickly evolving state, we make practical recommendations: 1) to select appropriate BioMeTs; 2) to develop composite digital measures; and 3) to design interoperable software to ingest, process, delegate, and visualize the data when deploying novel clinical applications. Multimodal BioMeTs will drive the evolution from in-clinic assessments to at-home data collection with a focus on prevention, personalization, and long-term outcomes by empowering health care providers with knowledge, delivering convenience, and an improved standard of care to patients. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Internet of Health Things (IoHT) is an extended version of the Internet of Things that is acting a starring role in data sharing remotely. These remote data sources consist of physiological processes, such as treatment progress, patient monitoring, and consultation. The main purpose of IoHT platform is to intervene independently from geographically remote areas by providing low-cost preventive or active healthcare services. Several low-power biomedical sensors with limited computing capabilities provide IoHT's communication, integration, computation, and interoperability. However, IoHT transfers IoT data via IP-centric Internet, which has implications for security and privacy. To address this issue, in this paper, we suggest using named data networking (NDN), a future Internet model that is well suited for mobile patients and caregivers. As the IoHT contains a lot of personal information about a user's physical condition, which can be detrimental to users' finances and health if leaked, therefore, data protection is important in the IoHT. Experts and scholars have researched this area, but the reconstruction of existing schemes could be further improved. Also, doing computing-intensive tasks leads to slower response times, which further worsens the performance of IoHT. We are trying to resolve such an error, so a new NDN-based certificateless signcryption scheme is proposed for IoHT using the security hardness of the hyperelliptic curve cryptosystem. Security analysis and comparisons with existing schemes show the viability of the designed scheme. The final results confirm that the designed scheme provides better security with minimal computational and communicational resources. Finally, we validate the security of the designed scheme against man-in-the-middle attacks and replay attacks using the AVISPA tool.  © 2021 Aroosa et al.

AB  - Recently, smart medical devices have become preva-lent in remote monitoring of patients and the delivery of medication. The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic situation has boosted the upward trend of the popularity of smart medical devices in the healthcare system. Simultaneously, different device manufacturers and technologies compete for a share in a smart medical device's market, which forces the integration of diverse smart medical de-vices into a common healthcare ecosystem. Hence, modern unified healthcare communication systems (UHCSs) combine ISO/IEEE 11073 and Health Level Seven (HL7) communication standards to support smart medical devices' interoperability and their communication with healthcare providers. Despite their advantages in supporting various smart medical devices and communication technologies, these standards do not provide any security and suffer from vulnerabilities. Existing studies provide stand-alone security solutions to components of UHCSs and do not cover UHCSs holistically. In this paper, we perform a systematic threat analysis of UHCSs that relies on attack-defense tree (ADTree) formalisms. Considering the attack landscape and defense ecosys-tem, we build an ADTree for UHCSs and convert the ADTree to stochastic timed automata (STA) to perform quantitative analysis. Our analysis using UPPAAL SMC shows that the Man-in-the-Middle and unauthorized remote access attacks are the most probable attacks that a malicious entity could pursue, causing mistreatment to patients. We also extract valuable information about the top threats, the likelihood of performing different individual and simultaneous attacks, and the expected cost for attackers. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - The semantic web of things (SWT) is useful for the remote-based automatic assessment of smart healthcare devices connected via the internet at each level. The SWT's interoperability across many platforms and systems based on the Internet of Things (IoT) represents a significant and highly complex challenge. However, various healthcare applications can result in tremendous benefits. Current SWT usage trends in IoT healthcare applications are remote patient monitoring, drug delivery traceability, and patient diagnosis. However, the current technology does not address reusability and interoperability in SWT in IoT applications. To overcome the limitations of an existing system, an ontology-based modeling framework and an IoT-based semantic M2M platform are proposed. This framework employs ontologies used in the IoT healthcare domain to design knowledge frameworks, automated sequencing, and processing and offer semantic descriptions of various concepts and their relationships. The SWRL rule addresses the issue of insufficient ontology expressivity in property association and operation to facilitate spatial connection reasoning. Using Protege and its plug-ins, a system based on ontologies and rules was constructed. The proposed IoT-based SWT framework facilitates hospital device interoperability and semantic annotation. This chapter focuses on a collaborative approach to developing a unique framework for semantic interoperability in healthcare applications employing IoT. © 2023 River Publishers. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background and Objectives: The healthcare industry is fast accepting the benefits of Internet of Medical Things (IoMTs) and incorporating the services in day-to-day activity. The objective of this review was to comprehensively review the IoMTs, briefly revisit the functioning architecture, classify, list the challenges and possible solutions, and suggest the future trends among IoMTs usage and implementation. Materials and Methods: During April 2021, an extensive search for articles for Internet of Medical Things (IoMTs), medical devices, Internet of Things (IoTs) with biosensors either in title or in keywords was done using PubMed, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, and Web of Science databases. Studies were categorized into two types: those evaluating the clinical outcomes of IoMTs and those evaluating the technological basis of IoMTs. Results: IoMT architecture was reviewed under four headings: sensors, IoT gateway/framework, machine learning, and reporting tools. IoMT classification based on place of usage (body centric IoMTs, hospital IoMTs with point of care kiosks, and ubiquitous IoMTs), based on the system-wise application (cardiovascular, renal, pulmonary, endocrine, medication) and based on outcomes (fitness-alone IoMTs, clinical grading and monitoring IoMTs, and remote patient monitoring IoMTs) is proposed. Conclusion: IoMTs can be classified based on the place of usage into body centric, hospital-based, and ubiquitous systems. Classification based on the body systems and sensors aids in first-hand information about the existing IoMTs. Challenges for effective implementation of IoMTs are interoperability, data privacy, security, regulatory, and infrastructural costs. The future is promising for IoMTs with robust technological improvement and effective implementation.  © 2022 Medical Journal of Babylon | Published by Wolters Kluwer-Medknow.

AB  - Purpose of Review: This review discusses how wearable devices—sensors externally applied to the body to measure a physiological signal—can be used in heart failure (HF) care. Recent Findings: Most wearables are marketed to consumers and can measure movement, heart rate, and blood pressure; detect and monitor arrhythmia; and support exercise training and rehabilitation. Wearable devices targeted at healthcare professionals include ECG patch recorders and vests, patches, and textiles with in-built sensors for improved prognostication and the early detection of acute decompensation. Integrating data from wearables into clinical decision-making has been slow due to clinical inertia and concerns regarding data security and validity, lack of evidence of meaningful impact, interoperability, regulatory and reimbursement issues, and legal liability. Summary: Although few studies have assessed how best to integrate wearable technologies into clinical practice, their use is rapidly expanding and may support improved decision-making by patients and healthcare professionals along the whole patient pathway. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Current m-Health scenarios in the smart living era, as the interpretation of the smart city at each person’s level, present several challenges associated with interoperability between different clinical devices and applications. The Continua Health Alliance establishes design guidelines to standardize application communication to guarantee interoperability among medical devices. In this paper, we describe the implementation of two IEEE agents for oxygen saturation level (SpO2) measurements and electrocardiogram (ECG) data acquisition, respectively, and a smartphone IEEE manager for validation. We developed both IEEE agents over the Bluetooth Health Device Profile following the Continua guidelines and they are part of a telemonitoring system. This system was evaluated in a sample composed of 10 volunteers (mean age 29.8 ± 7.1 y/o; 5 females) under supervision of an expert cardiologist. The evaluation consisted of measuring the SpO2 and ECG signal sitting and at rest, before and after exercising for 15 min. Physiological measurements were assessed and compared against commercial devices, and our expert physician did not find any relevant differences in the ECG signal. Additionally, the system was assessed when acquiring and processing different heart rate data to prove that warnings were generated when the heart rate was under/above the thresholds for bradycardia and tachycardia, respectively. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The wearable tech revolution and the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) gadgets have created exciting new opportunities for remote patient monitoring. Healthcare providers are increasingly utilizing wearable technologies to expedite the process of diagnosis and treatment. The healthcare and research fields have been substantially impacted by emerging technologies. On the other hand, there are legitimate worries regarding the security of data transfers and transaction recording upon using these technologies. Healthcare departments need easy data interchange for interoperability. Protecting data security and integrity is crucial when exchanging information with authorized parties. In many existing solutions, patients’ sensitive data is collected and stored in smart healthcare systems. Scalability, breach or unauthorized access to this data can compromise privacy. The adoption of blockchain technology is one way to safeguard patient privacy in healthcare. Also, by facilitating the safe and secure exchange of data, blockchain technology is revolutionizing the healthcare industry by making traditional methods of diagnosis and treatment more reliable. However, blockchain has serious problems with its highly limited scalability. This article suggests a new method “SHORTBLOCKS” depending on blockchain technology for the safe administration and analysis of data. To circumvent the security-scalability issue and achieve high throughput, this study employs the newly introduced protocol “SHORTBLOCKS”, which extends blockchain concept to a direct acyclic graph of blocks. The proposed system uses both a private and a public blockchain that are created on the new protocol. In order to analyze patient health data, a system using smart contracts and a private blockchain is built. The system logs the occurrence to the public blockchain in the case that the smart contract raises an alarm due to an unusual reading. This will fix the scalability issue with initial blockchain as well as the security and privacy issues involved in remote patient monitoring. Simulation results shows the performance of the proposed system by comparing with existing solutions, SPECTRE protocol and GHOSTDAG protocol. © 2024 SCPE.

AB  - The emergence of the internet of things (IoT) has provided a dynamic change of healthcare system that enables interoperability and secure data transmission for a more effective healthcare delivery. This paper extends the implementation of IoT in combining medical devices and sensors with an IoT platform. Among various fundamental vital signs, respiratory rate is one of the most sensitive indicators of physiological conditions. Although it is deemed as a prognostic parameter that can predict miscellaneous diseases, respiratory rate monitoring remains frequently omitted and considered as time-consuming using manual counting methods. To address this problem, this paper presents a prototype of a respiratory rate monitoring device based on IoT and real-time systems. The device is equipped with an accelerometer sensor to measure abdominal movement generated by the inhale-exhale process. Butterworth filter and peak detection algorithm are applied to the signal to detect respiratory cycles. The proposed system uses the message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) protocol that implements publish-subscribe systems. Respiratory rate results are featured on the Node-RED dashboard with motion and peak signals plotted during the test. Monitoring was carried out on five participants and the results were analyzed using paired t-test. Good performance was demonstrated by having no significant difference in respiratory rate using the proposed method compared to the actual values (p>0.05). Hence, this work provides a convenient technique for respiratory rate estimation and may further allow for the improvement of the effectiveness of remote patient monitoring.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - The emergence of biomedical sensor devices, wireless communication, and innovation in other technologies for healthcare applications result in the evolution of a new area of research that is termed as Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs). WBAN originates from Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), which are used for implementing many healthcare systems integrated with networks and wireless devices to ensure remote healthcare monitoring. WBAN is a network of wearable devices implanted in or on the human body. The main aim of WBAN is to collect the human vital signs/physiological data (like ECG, body temperature, EMG, glucose level, etc.) round-the-clock from patients that demand secure, optimal and efficient routing techniques. The efficient, secure, and reliable designing of routing protocol is a difficult task in WBAN due to its diverse characteristic and restraints, such as energy consumption and temperature-rise of implanted sensors. The two significant constraints, overheating of nodes and energy efficiency must be taken into account while designing a reliable blockchain-enabled WBAN routing protocol. The purpose of this study is to achieve stability and efficiency in the routing of WBAN through managing temperature and energy limitations. Moreover, the blockchain provides security, transparency, and lightweight solution for the interoperability of physiological data with other medical personnel in the healthcare ecosystem. In this research work, the blockchain-based Adaptive Thermal-/Energy-Aware Routing (ATEAR) protocol for WBAN is proposed. Temperature rise, energy consumption, and throughput are the evaluation metrics considered to analyze the performance of ATEAR for data transmission. In contrast, transaction throughput, latency, and resource utilization are used to investigate the outcome of the blockchain system. Hyperledger Caliper, a benchmarking tool, is used to evaluate the performance of the blockchain system in terms of CPU utilization, memory, and memory utilization. The results show that by preserving residual energy and avoiding overheated nodes as forwarders, high throughput is achieved with the ultimate increase of the network lifetime. Castalia, a simulation tool, is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed protocol, and its comparison is made with Multipath Ring Routing Protocol (MRRP), thermal-aware routing algorithm (TARA), and Shortest-Hop (SHR). Evaluation results illustrate that the proposed protocol performs significantly better in balancing of temperature (to avoid damaging heat effect on the body tissues) and energy consumption (to prevent the replacement of battery and to increase the embedded sensor node life) with efficient data transmission achieving a high throughput value. © MDPI AG.

AB  - Background: Due to demographic change and, more recently, coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the importance of modern intensive care units (ICU) is becoming apparent. One of the key components of an ICU is the continuous monitoring of patients' vital parameters. However, existing advances in informatics, signal processing, or engineering that could alleviate the burden on ICUs have not yet been applied. This could be due to the lack of user involvement in research and development. Objective: This study focused on the satisfaction of ICU staff with current patient monitoring and their suggestions for future improvements. We aimed to identify aspects of monitoring that interrupt patient care, display devices for remote monitoring, use cases for artificial intelligence (AI), and whether ICU staff members are willing to improve their digital literacy or contribute to the improvement of patient monitoring. We further aimed to identify differences in the responses of different professional groups. Methods: This survey study was performed with ICU staff from 4 ICUs of a German university hospital between November 2019 and January 2020. We developed a web-based 36-item survey questionnaire, by analyzing a preceding qualitative interview study with ICU staff, about the clinical requirements of future patient monitoring. Statistical analyses of questionnaire results included median values with their bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals, and chi-square tests to compare the distributions of item responses of the professional groups. Results: In total, 86 of the 270 ICU physicians and nurses completed the survey questionnaire. The majority stated they felt confident using the patient monitoring equipment, but that high rates of false-positive alarms and the many sensor cables interrupted patient care. Regarding future improvements, respondents asked for wireless sensors, a reduction in the number of false-positive alarms, and hospital standard operating procedures for alarm management. Responses to the display devices proposed for remote patient monitoring were divided. Most respondents indicated it would be useful for earlier alerting or when they were responsible for multiple wards. AI for ICUs would be useful for early detection of complications and an increased risk of mortality; in addition, the AI could propose guidelines for therapy and diagnostics. Transparency, interoperability, usability, and staff training were essential to promote the use of AI. The majority wanted to learn more about new technologies for the ICU and required more time for learning. Physicians had fewer reservations than nurses about AI-based intelligent alarm management and using mobile phones for remote monitoring. Conclusions: This survey study of ICU staff revealed key improvements for patient monitoring in intensive care medicine. Hospital providers and medical device manufacturers should focus on reducing false alarms, implementing hospital alarm standard operating procedures, introducing wireless sensors, preparing for the use of AI, and enhancing the digital literacy of ICU staff. Our results may contribute to the user-centered transfer of digital technologies into practice to alleviate challenges in intensive care medicine. © 2020 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

AB  - Decentralized clinical trials (DCTs) are gaining momentum in clinical research as these studies can be executed remotely through telemedicine and mobile/local health-care providers. The COVID-19 pandemic has further accelerated advances and adoption in this area. In the past few years, there has been significant development and growth in the use of remote data that are electronically transmitted from a clinical trial (CT) participant, from outside the clinical setting, to a data repository. Such data may include laboratory data, safety data, or outcome measures reported by the participant, the clinician or the observer. Similarly, wearable health monitoring devices are being increasingly used in health-care and CT settings. Digital biomarkers, which can support continuous measurement of physiologic parameters outside the physical confines of the clinical environment, are also creating new and improved opportunities for patient care and biomedical research, enabling remote monitoring and DCTs. There are several benefits to using remote data capture, wearables, and digital biomarkers in clinical health-care research; however, several questions and challenges still need to be addressed. In an effort to understand the adoption of these technologies in DCTs, and the challenges therein, the authors of this workstream conducted an online survey of clinical research stakeholders across India and reviewed 80 responses. The review article summarizes the key findings from this online survey. © 2024 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications. All rights reserved.

AB  - As described throughout this book, there are several different factors impacting the performance and strategy for healthcare organizations. Certainly, the industry will see changes tomorrow that we have not even imagined. Today, the industry is grappling with how to improve medical technology to get closer to patients, through artificial intelligence and digital transformation that will help organizations be more consumer centric. Population health management, telehealth, and remote patient monitoring are also becoming more advanced, as healthcare delivery moves outside of hospital walls. Interoperability will also become more important, with the ability to seamlessly share data between apps, providers, and multiple partners within the healthcare value chain. Re-examining how health is reimbursed, through value-based payments and bundled care, will force a higher focus on cost-effectiveness. Rapid deployment of new vaccines to deal with future pandemics also need to be part of the agenda. Public health in general will undergo significant transformations going forward as well. © 2024 James Langabeer.All rights reserved.

AB  - In the modern era, the role of antennas has grown dramatically high, especially in biological applications. Because of its size, compactness, non-invasive nature, safety, and cheaper cost, wearable antennas are utilized in numerous industries, including healthcare and Internet of Things (IoT). Additionally, wireless technology and wearable remote monitoring systems are essential methods for healthcare without sacrificing the life. In this paper, a low-profile antenna with Coplanar Waveguide (CPW) feeding technique is designed to operate at three frequencies 2.2GHz/4.2GHz/6GHz in wireless local area networks (WLAN), Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX), and Bluetooth for remote monitoring. Three resonant frequencies are produced using split-ring resonators with a circular shape antenna. To make a wearable antenna for patient monitoring, the proposed antenna is fabricated with a PREPERM paper substrate. This substrate, which is from PREMIX group, has a dielectric constant of 3.55 and a loss tangent of 0.005. The proposed antenna is studied based on parameters such as voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR), radiation patterns, return loss (S11) and gain. For antenna design, simulation and analysis, High-Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS) software has been used. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Healthcare is an emerging sector with the integration of emerging technologies aiming to improve Quality of Life of an individual through various medical services. Most of the healthcare services work with sensitive information of patients either collected in real-time using body implanted sensors or through various IoT enabled medical devices during the diagnosis in a centrally controlled model. But, the traditional IoT based medical services suffer from several challenges such as data security, privacy, interoperability, single point of failure, scalability, and data integrity. However, by considering the advantages of Blockchain technology and the disadvantages of IoT systems, the amalgamation of a decentralised, distributed ledger technology with the IoT for various healthcare applications will strengthen the system by resolving the major challenges. Thus, this research article conducts a comprehensive survey on the integration of Blockchain and IoT (BCIoT) for Healthcare services, focusing mainly on existing approaches, possibilities, applications and challenges. First, we present a detailed overview of Blockchain, IoT and the motivation for BCIoT along with the survey on existing healthcare applications. Next we discuss the enabling platforms for BCIoT based healthcare services. For the better understanding, we review the role of BCIoT in Remote patient monitoring, electronic heath record management, Health asset tracing, Covid-19 infected patient contact tracking. Finally challenges and future directions are discussed to improve the Quality of Life of patients through Healthcare applications. © 2023

AB  - The COVID-19 emergency has given a great acceleration to the transformation processes of remote health pathways (telemedicine), which Apulia had already begun to pursue with the POR Puglia 2014-2020 from which CORēHealth, established at AReSS, derives directly. CORēHealth is characterized by: Web-cloud platform with HL7-FHIR interoperability; Televisit, Teleconsultation, Telemonitoring, Telecooperation and Teleconferencing; Device traceability system; Clinical repository; Patient Synoptic; Central Alarms; Mobile App for the Citizens (Android and IoS); Integration with the Regional Health Information System, Electronic health record, etc. The APP promotes the patient's involvement in the care process: keeping in touch with his/her specialist doctor and caregiver (video calls and chat); consult the agenda of the televised programs with patient's care team; view his/her treatment plan; enter the vital parameters that are communicated to the doctor in real time; manage their clinical diary and possibly share it with the care team; facilitate the measurement of compliance with the treatment path (drug intake, lifestyle). Each patient is assigned a treatment plan based on the specific Integrated Care Pathway(s) for their pathologies; the medical team, based on the specific needs, can provide patients with a kit of medical devices (e.g. oximeter, multiparameter, scale, sphygmomanometer, ecg, etc.), interoperable with the control unit, suitable for real-time detection and monitoring of the salient vital parameters that allow constant detection and monitoring, and possible intervention by virtue of the automatic alarm system the control unit is equipped with. From January 2022 the transformation of the Apulian Oncological Network into a digital key was started and therefore the training of the operators of the Oncological Guidance Centers and the Breast Units and the enrollment of about 23,000 cancer patients (approx. Breast). Another fundamental element of the CORēHealth is the systematic approach in Continuing Training and Consolidation of Digital Skills to enable informed access of all the actors involved to new digital technologies. And this is why AReSS has launched a virtuous path of training, change management and digital literacy for all users (medical and administrative teams) and patients. © ICT 2023.All rights reserved.

AB  - Pervasive healthcare services have evolved substantially in the recent years with IoMT rapidly changing the pace and scale of healthcare delivery. A promising application of IoMT is to fetch patterns of mental behaviour symptomatology based on bio-signals and transfer it to the corresponding hospital or psychologist for remote monitoring. But the data volume performance, device diversity interoperability, hacking unauthorized use and acceptance adoption barriers still restrain the practical and competent use of these devices. This research presents a plausible solution to surmount the data overload and processing latency in real-time sensory data collected through wearable devices for mental health monitoring. We propose a modified k-medoid data clustering technique based on time-frame restricted intra-cluster similarity calculations to obtain a summarized version of the original benchmark WESAD dataset for which the degree of information lost is minimum. A CNN is then trained on this summarized dataset for classification of mental state into the baseline, stress and amusement categories. The results show a significant reduction in the average execution time by 34% with a comparable accuracy to the original dataset, thus offering prompt real-time healthcare analytics. © 2001-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Telemonitoring is a branch of telehealth that aims at remotely monitoring vital signs, which is important for chronically ill patients and the elderly living alone. The available standalone devices and applications for the self-monitoring of health parameters largely suffer from interoperability problems; meanwhile, telemonitoring medical devices are expensive, self-contained, and are not integrated into user-friendly technological platforms for the end user. This paper presents the technical aspects and usability assessment of the telemonitoring features of the HEREiAM platform, which supports heterogeneous information technology systems. By exploiting a service-oriented architecture, the measured parameters collected by off-the-shelf Bluetooth medical devices are sent as XML documents to a private cloud that implements an interoperable health service infrastructure, which is compliant with the most recent healthcare standards and security protocols. This Android-based system is designed to be accessible both via TV and portable devices, and includes other utilities designed to support the elderly living alone. Four usability assessment sessions with quality-validated questionnaires were performed to accurately understand the ease of use, usefulness, acceptance, and quality of the proposed system. The results reveal that our system achieved very high usability scores even at its first use, and the scores did not significantly change over time during a field trial that lasted for four months, reinforcing the idea of an intuitive design. At the end of such a trial, the user-experience questionnaire achieved excellent scores in all aspects with respect to the benchmark. Good results were also reported by general practitioners who assessed the quality of their remote interfaces for telemonitoring. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Healthcare, the largest global industry, is undergoing significant transformations with the genesis of a new technology known as the Internet of Things (IoT). Many healthcare leaders are investing more money for transforming their services to harness the benefits provided by IoT, thereby paving the way for the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), an extensive collection of medical sensors and associated infrastructure. IoMT has many benefits like providing remote healthcare by monitoring health vitals of patients at a distant place, providing healthcare services to elderly people, and monitoring a large group of people in a region or country for detection and prevention of epidemics. This paper provides a review of IoT in the healthcare domain by first describing the enabling technologies for delivering smart healthcare, followed by some of the key applications of IoT in healthcare. Next, a fog-based architecture consisting of three layers for IoT-based healthcare applications is proposed. Finally, we focus on some of the open challenges of IoT in healthcare, like fault tolerance, interoperability, latency, energy efficiency, and availability. Existing solutions for these challenges are also discussed. © 2020 Universite de Liege. All rights reserved.

AB  - Telemedicine can provide benefits in patient affected by chronic diseases or elderly citizens as part of standard routine care supported by digital health. The GATEKEEPER (GK) Project was financed to create a vendor independent platform to be adopted in medical practice and to demonstrate its effect, benefit value, and scalability in 8 connected medical use cases with some independent pilots. This paper, after a description of the GK platform architecture, is focused on the creation of a FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource) IG (Implementation Guide) and its adoption in specific use cases. The final aim is to combine conventional data, collected in the hospital, with unconventional data, coming from wearable devices, to exploit artificial intelligence (AI) models designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a new parsimonious risk prediction model for Type 2 diabetes (T2D).

AB  - Aim: The goal is to design and, in a next step, establish a scalable, multi-center telemonitoring platform based on existing systems for monitoring COVID-19 patients in home quarantine. In particular, the focus will be on raw data acquisition, integration of sensor data into the hospital system, structured data storage, and interoperability. Subject and methods: Data necessary for monitoring, otherwise provided in various portals, will be continuously queried and integrated into the hospital system via a new interface in this proof-of-concept work. Results: Based on extensive preliminary work at Klinikum rechts der Isar with a structured clinical database, we extend our system’s integration of raw data and visualization in dashboards, as well as scientific provision of data from mobile sensors for monitoring patients in home quarantine. Conclusion: Based on existing integrated telemonitoring systems supporting semantic and syntactic interoperability, short-term provision of scientific databases is possible. The integration of different mobile sensors into a clinical system for remote monitoring of patients around the clock is still new and to our knowledge unique. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Diabetes is a metabolic disease that affects millions of people each year. It is associated with an increased likelihood of vital organ failures and decreased quality of life. Early detection and regular monitoring are crucial for managing diabetes. Remote patient monitoring can facilitate effective intervention and treatment paradigms using current technology. This work proposes an end-to-end remote monitoring framework for automated diabetes risk prediction and management, using personal health devices, smart wearables and smartphones. A support vector machine was developed for diabetes risk prediction using the Pima Indian Diabetes Database, after feature scaling, imputation, selection and augmentation. This work achieved the performance metrics of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity scores at 83.20%, 87.20% and 79% respectively through the tenfold stratified cross validation method, which is competitive with existing methods. Patients can use multiple healthcare devices, smartphones and smartwatches to measure vital parameters, curb the progression of diabetes and close the communication loop with medical professionals. The proposed framework enables medical professionals to make informed decisions based on the latest diabetes risk predictions and lifestyle insights while attaining unobtrusiveness, reduced cost, and vendor interoperability. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - The development and adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHR) and health monitoring Internet of Things (IoT) Devices have enabled digitization of patient records and has also substantially transformed the healthcare delivery system in aspects such as remote patient monitoring, healthcare decision making, and medical research. However, data tends to be fragmented among health infrastructures, and prevents interoperability of medical data at the point of care. In order to address this gap, we introduce BlockIoT that uses blockchain technology to transfer previously inaccessible and centralized data from medical devices to EHR systems, which provides greater insight to providers who can, in turn, provide better outcomes for patients. This notion of interoperability of medical device data is possible through an Application Programming Interface (API), which serves as a versatile endpoint for all incoming medical device data, a distributed file system that ensures data resilience, and knowledge templates that analyze, identify, and represent medical device data to providers. Our participatory design survey on BlockIoT demonstrates that BlockIoT is a suitable system to supplement physicians' clinical practice and increases efficiency in most healthcare specialties, including cardiology, pulmonology, endocrinology, and primary care. ©2021 AMIA - All rights reserved.

AB  - The CAPABLE project has been funded by the European Union to develop a telemonitoring and coaching platform improving the quality of life for cancer patients. The platform, based on a multi agent blackboard architecture, is classified as a medical device according to the current EU regulation. Thus it needs extensive tests before being put into service for the planned clinical trials, which calls for a dedicated simulating and testing environment. Materials and Methods: Coordination in CAPABLE is achieved through the Case Manager, a component able to generate and notify events to other interested agent components. For representing and exchanging health care information we have adopted HL7 FHIR as a semantic interoperability standard. Results: FHIR has been exploited to design a structured history of a real patient affected by renal cell carcinoma. A simulator has been developed for automating the whole testing process represented by specific scenarios of the patient's history. Conclusions: The simulator relies on the events produced by the Case Manager for coordinating the agents. This proved to be effective in checking that the agents reactions to new data showing up on the blackboard comply with the expected behavior.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - IoT has seen remarkable growth, particularly in healthcare, leading to the rise of IoMT. IoMT integrates medical devices for real-time data analysis and transmission but faces challenges in data security and interoperability. This research identifies a significant gap in the existing literature regarding a comprehensive ontology for vulnerabilities in medical IoT devices. This paper proposes a fundamental domain ontology named MIoT (Medical Internet of Things) ontology, focusing on cybersecurity in IoMT (Internet of Medical Things), particularly in remote patient monitoring settings. This research will refer to similar-looking acronyms, IoMT and MIoT ontology. It is important to distinguish between the two. IoMT is a collection of various medical devices and their applications within the research domain. On the other hand, MIoT ontology refers to the proposed ontology that defines various concepts, roles, and individuals. MIoT ontology utilizes the knowledge engineering methodology outlined in Ontology Development 101, along with the structured life cycle, and establishes semantic interoperability among medical devices to secure IoMT assets from vulnerabilities and cyberattacks. By defining key concepts and relationships, it becomes easier to understand and analyze the complex network of information within the IoMT. The MIoT ontology captures essential key terms and security-related entities for future extensions. A conceptual model is derived from the MIoT ontology and validated through a case study. Furthermore, this paper outlines a roadmap for future research, highlighting potential impacts on security automation in healthcare applications. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) for medical purposes offers a number of benefits, including the aptitude to follow the individual's physical state over a range of time intervals and transmitting data in real time. Using gadgets like glucose meters, heart monitoring implants, Electrocardiogram (ECG), blood pressure monitors, Electroencephalography (EEG) and Electromyography (EMG) wearable strategies, medical personnel can gather local patient wellness data and make choices based on it. The IoT devices' weak authentication and encryption procedures make them readily hackable and may expose users to a number of risks, some of which could be fatal. The Quality of Service (QoS) needs for healthcare IoT devices, such as dependability, authorization, identity and security, cannot be met by current algorithms using machine learning or blockchain approaches operating in the cloud computing environment. Henceforth the proposed work develops an advanced Fog computing (FC) to oppose advance cloud computing at an edge of networks together with Block chain topology. Fog computing has been emphasized as promising method for low-cost remote monitoring, limiting down on latency, and boosting efficiency, while blockchain has been touted for guaranteeing the security of private data, building a decentralized database, and improving data interoperability. The problem of healthcare IoT device recognition, permission and confirmation for scalability often broadcast of data in a distributed setting can be handled by merging FC with block chain. So, leveraging FC and blockchain, a creative solution to the aforementioned issue. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - The Internet of Health Things (IoHT) is an extended breed of the Internet of Things (IoT), which plays an important role in the remote sharing of data from various physical processes such as patient monitoring, treatment progress, observation, and consultation. The key benefit of the IoHT platform is the ease of time-independent interaction from geographically distant locations by offering preventive or proactive healthcare services at a lower cost. The communication, integration, computation, and interoperability in IoHT are provided by various low-power biomedical sensors equipped with limited computational capabilities. Therefore, conventional cryptographic solutions are not feasible for the majority of IoHT applications. In addition, executing computing-intensive tasks will lead to a slow response time that can deteriorate the performance of IoHT. We strive to resolve such a deficiency, and thus a new scheme has been proposed in this article, called an online-offline signature scheme in certificateless settings. The scheme divides the signing part into two phases, i.e., online and offline. In the absence of a message, the offline phase performs computationally intensive tasks, while lighter computations are executed in the online phase when there is a message. Security analyses and comparisons with the respective existing schemes are carried out to show the feasibility of the proposed scheme. The results obtained authenticate that the proposed scheme offers enhanced security with lower computational and communication costs.  © 2020 Muhammad Asghar Khan et al.

AB  - Eventually, the ways of interactions among humans, health devices, and healthcare facilities are evolving and becoming smarter and quicker. Wireless wearables unified with IoT are becoming an effective everyday tool to analyze and collect patients' health data and keep a track of the health of those who have a risk of persistent disease. Uninterrupted attendance by the healthcare workers and convenience for the patients during a crisis in remote areas is the primary factor to be addressed by a healthcare monitoring system. Such a system materializes personal medical treatment to rural patients and helps to reduce their medical costs with a constantly enhanced outcome. LoRa due to its wide coverage, offers a concrete framework for IoT that can certainly transform the healthcare trade to the next level yet it encounters some challenges like latency, unbalanced loading of data, and diverseness of the applications and user requests. Healthcare is such a field where even a little delay may cost the life of a patient. Cloud computing has been considered as a base to provide IoT solutions but it too calls for limitations when it comes to distance from the point of origin of IoT data. There is an upsurge of Fog computing solutions, to eradicate such challenges by bringing computation power nearer to the origin of data. Notwithstanding, the cloud-fog-IoT unification and interoperability entail intricate engineering of services and applications so that the solutions can utilize the distributed resources without bargaining the Quality of Service (QoS), privacy, and efficiency.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, health services around the globe are struggling. An effective system for monitoring patients can improve healthcare delivery by avoiding in-person contacts, enabling early-detection of severe cases, and remotely assessing patients’ status. Internet of Things (IoT) technologies have been used for monitoring patients’ health with wireless wearable sensors in different scenarios and medical conditions, such as noncommunicable and infectious diseases. Combining IoT-related technologies with early-warning scores (EWS) commonly utilized in infirmaries has the potential to enhance health services delivery significantly. Specifically, the NEWS-2 has been showing remarkable results in detecting the health deterioration of COVID-19 patients. Although the literature presents several approaches for remote monitoring, none of these studies proposes a customized, complete, and integrated architecture that uses an effective early-detection mechanism for COVID-19 and that is flexible enough to be used in hospital wards and at home. Therefore, this article's objective is to present a comprehensive IoT-based conceptual architecture that addresses the key requirements of scalability, interoperability, network dynamics, context discovery, reliability, and privacy in the context of remote health monitoring of COVID-19 patients in hospitals and at home. Since remote monitoring of patients at home (essential during a pandemic) can engender trust issues regarding secure and ethical data collection, a consent management module was incorporated into our architecture to provide transparency and ensure data privacy. Further, the article details mechanisms for supporting a configurable and adaptable scoring system embedded in wearable devices to increase usefulness and flexibility for health care professions working with EWS. © 2021
