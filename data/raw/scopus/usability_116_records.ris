AB  - Background: Patients admitted to general wards are inherently at risk of deterioration. Thus, tools that can provide early detection of deterioration may be lifesaving. Frequent remote patient monitoring (RPM) has the potential to allow such early detection, leading to a timely intervention by health care providers. Objective: This study aimed to assess the potential of a novel wearable RPM device to provide timely alerts in patients at high risk for deterioration. Methods: This prospective observational study was conducted in two general wards of a large tertiary medical center. Patients determined to be at high risk to deteriorate upon admission and assigned to a telemetry bed were included. On top of the standard monitoring equipment, a wearable monitor was attached to each patient, and monitoring was conducted in parallel. The data gathered by the wearable monitors were analyzed retrospectively, with the medical staff being blinded to them in real time. Several early warning scores of the risk for deterioration were used, all calculated from frequent data collected by the wearable RPM device: these included (1) the National Early Warning Score (NEWS), (2) Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Neurology, and Other (ABCNO) score, and (3) deterioration criteria defined by the clinical team as a “wish list” score. In all three systems, the risk scores were calculated every 5 minutes using the data frequently collected by the wearable RPM device. Data generated by the early warning scores were compared with those obtained from the clinical records of actual deterioration among these patients. Results: In total, 410 patients were recruited and 217 were included in the final analysis. The median age was 71 (IQR 62-78) years and 130 (59.9%) of them were male. Actual clinical deterioration occurred in 24 patients. The NEWS indicated high alert in 16 of these 24 (67%) patients, preceding actual clinical deterioration by 29 hours on average. The ABCNO score indicated high alert in 18 (75%) of these patients, preceding actual clinical deterioration by 38 hours on average. Early warning based on wish list scoring criteria was observed for all 24 patients 40 hours on average before clinical deterioration was detected by the medical staff. Importantly, early warning based on the wish list scoring criteria was also observed among all other patients who did not deteriorate. Conclusions: Frequent remote patient monitoring has the potential for early detection of a high risk to deteriorate among hospitalized patients, using both grouped signal-based scores and algorithm-based prediction. In this study, we show the ability to formulate scores for early warning by using RPM. Nevertheless, early warning scores compiled on the basis of these data failed to deliver reasonable specificity. Further efforts should be directed at improving the specificity and sensitivity of such tools. © Edward Itelman, Gadi Shlomai, Avshalom Leibowitz, Shiri Weinstein, Maya Yakir, Idan Tamir, Michal Sagiv, Aia Muhsen, Maxim Perelman, Daniella Kant, Eyal Zilber, Gad Segal.

AB  - Traditional trial designs have well-recognized inefficiencies and logistical barriers to participation. Decentralized trials and digital health solutions have been suggested as potential solutions and have certainly risen to the challenge during the pandemic. Clinical trial designs are now increasingly data driven. The use of distributed clinical data networks and digitization has helped to fundamentally upgrade existing research systems. A trial design may vary anywhere from fully decentralized to hybrid to traditional on-site. Various decentralization components are available for stakeholders to increase the reach and pace of their trials, such as electronic informed consent, remote interviews, administration, outcome assessment, monitoring, and laboratory and imaging modalities. Furthermore, digital health technologies can be included to enrich study conduct. However, careful consideration is warranted, including assessing verification and validity through usability studies and having various contingencies in place through dedicated risk assessment. Selecting the right combination depends not just on the ability to handle patient care and the medical know-how but also on the availability of appropriate technologic infrastructure, skills, and human resources. Throughout this process, quality of evidence generation and physician-patient relation must not be undermined. Here we also address some knowledge gaps, cost considerations, and potential impact of decentralization and digitization on inclusivity, recruitment, engagement, and retention. Last, we mention some future directions that may help drive the necessary change in the right direction. © 2023 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research

AB  - Background: The emergency for the COVID-19 pandemic has led to greater use of home telemonitoring devices. The aim of this study was to assess the usability of continuous home-monitoring care with an oxygen saturation device on post-COVID-19 patients. Method: The system consists of a digital continuous pulse oximeter and a smartphone with an App, which were provided to patients. A survey composed of a standard Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire, and a satisfaction questionnaire was exploited to conduct a usability and feasibility analysis of the service. Results: A total of 29 patients (17.2% female) with a mean age of 65 ± 11.5 years were enrolled: 20 patients were smartphone users (69%) with a mean age of 60.2 ± 9.5 years, and 9 patients (31%) did not own a smartphone (mean age 76.8 ± 5.9). The monitoring period was 1 month: a total of 444 recordings were conducted, 15 recordings per patient averagely. In total, 82% of the recordings performed did not require any intervention, while 18% led to the production of a report and subsequent intervention by a nurse who verified, together with the specialist, the need to intervene (i.e. the patient accessed the clinic for medical control and/or modification of oxygen therapy). A total of 17 patients compiled a usability questionnaire. The service was perceived as useful and well-structured, although it often required caregiver support. Conclusions: Using continuous home-monitoring care with an oxygen saturation device seems feasible and useful for patients who could be followed at home avoiding going back to the hospital every time a trend oximetry is needed. Further improvements in connections, data flow processes, and simplifications, based on patients’ feedback, are needed to scale up the service. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - Introduction. Wearable or home electronic devices with the function of transmitting information at a distance are used for the purpose of remote dynamic monitoring of the condition of patients. Aim. To determine the effectiveness of the use of "new" criteria for assessing the health status of patients with broncho-obstructive diseases in order to monitor remotely. Material and methods. 28 patients with broncho-obstructive diseases who were admitted for inpatient treatment were examined. Most of them had comorbidities, mainly cardiovascular pathology. A general clinical examination and special research methods were performed: an interactive survey using the respiratory module of the Electronic Polyclinic program, remote monitoring of vital signs using a smart watch and a mobile application for recording and transmitting information, a 6-minute walk test with simultaneous recording of vital signs with using a smart watch, a questionnaire and a scale for assessing the usability of the System usability scale system. The analysis of the results was performed by using the Statistica 13.0 software package. Results and discussion. Interactive survey corresponded to the severity of dyspnea according to the mMRC and Borg scales. The 6-minute walk test showed a significant limitation of physical activity and an increase in heart rate. The deep sleep phase has been limited. The CRP index averaged 7.78±8.48 µg/l. More than 85% of patients expressed their willingness to continue observation. The results of the correlation analysis demonstrated a direct relationship with the patient's physical activity assessment and the results of the 6-minute walk test, and an inverse relationship with the 6-minute walk test result and the patients' age, severity of respiratory failure and CRP concentration. The duration of deep sleep is inversely correlated with the SpO2 value. Our studies made it possible to compare the obtained data with the results of traditional methods of examining a patient, to confirm the position that the physical activity of a patient with broncho-obstructive disease is connected with indicators of the function of external respiration, and also that the total duration of sleep of COPD patients mainly consists of light sleep with a decrease in the duration of deep sleep. An inverse relationship was found with the duration of deep sleep and the concentration of CRP and the value of SpO2. The described monitoring system allows you to timely adjust the treatment regimen, reduce the number of hospitalizations, the risk of exacerbation or death.Conclusion. Additional instrumental control of vital parameters increases the efficiency of the system of long-term remote monitoring of patients with broncho-obstructive diseases. the indicators represent the severity of the symptoms of the disease and the degree of violations of the indicators of the function of external respiration. © 2023 LLC "IMC" Modern Clinical Medicine.

AB  - Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, novel digital health technologies have the potential to improve our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, improve care delivery, and produce better health outcomes. The National Institutes of Health called on digital health leaders to contribute to a high-quality data repository that will support researchers to make discoveries that are otherwise not possible with small, limited data sets. Objective: To this end, we seek to develop a COVID-19 digital biomarker for early detection of physiological exacerbation or decompensation. We propose the development and validation of a COVID-19 decompensation Index (CDI) in a 2-phase study that builds on existing wearable biosensor-derived analytics generated by physIQ's end-to-end cloud platform for continuous physiological monitoring with wearable biosensors. This effort serves to achieve two primary objectives: (1) to collect adequate data to help develop the CDI and (2) to collect rich deidentified clinical data correlating with outcomes and symptoms related to COVID-19 progression. Our secondary objectives include evaluation of the feasibility and usability of pinpointIQ, a digital platform through which data are gathered, analyzed, and displayed. Methods: This is a prospective, nonrandomized, open-label, 2-phase study. Phase I will involve data collection for the digital data hub of the National Institutes of Health as well as data to support the preliminary development of the CDI. Phase II will involve data collection for the hub and contribute to continued refinement and validation of the CDI. While this study will focus on the development of a CDI, the digital platform will also be evaluated for feasibility and usability while clinicians deliver care to continuously monitored patients enrolled in the study. Results: Our target CDI will be a binary classifier trained to distinguish participants with and those without decompensation. The primary performance metric for CDI will be the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve with a minimum performance criterion of ≥0.75 (α=.05; power [1-β]=0.80). Furthermore, we will determine the sex or gender and race or ethnicity of the participants, which would account for differences in the CDI performance, as well as the lead time-time to predict decompensation-and its relationship with the ultimate disease severity based on the World Health Organization COVID-19 ordinal scale. Conclusions: Using machine learning techniques on a large data set of patients with COVID-19 could provide valuable insights into the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and a digital biomarker for COVID-19 decompensation. Through this study, we intend to develop a tool that can uniquely reflect physiological data of a diverse population and contribute to high-quality data that will help researchers better understand COVID-19. ©Karen Larimer, Stephan Wegerich, Joel Splan, David Chestek, Heather Prendergast, Terry Vanden Hoek.

AB  - Digital health tracking is a source of valuable insights for public health research and consumer health technology. The brain is the most complex organ, containing information about psychophysical and physiological biomarkers that correlate with health. Specifically, recent developments in electroencephalogram (EEG), functional near-infra-red spectroscopy (fNIRS), and photoplethysmography (PPG) technologies have allowed the development of devices that can remotely monitor changes in brain activity. The inclusion criteria for the papers in this review encompassed studies on self-applied, remote, non-invasive neuroimaging techniques (EEG, fNIRS, or PPG) within healthcare applications. A total of 23 papers were reviewed, comprising 17 on using EEGs for remote monitoring and 6 on neurofeedback interventions, while no papers were found related to fNIRS and PPG. This review reveals that previous studies have leveraged mobile EEG devices for remote monitoring across the mental health, neurological, and sleep domains, as well as for delivering neurofeedback interventions. With headsets and ear-EEG devices being the most common, studies found mobile devices feasible for implementation in study protocols while providing reliable signal quality. Moderate to substantial agreement overall between remote and clinical-grade EEGs was found using statistical tests. The results highlight the promise of portable brain-imaging devices with regard to continuously evaluating patients in natural settings, though further validation and usability enhancements are needed as this technology develops. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Mobile health (mHealth) has emerged as a potential solution to providing valuable ecological information about the severity and burden of Parkinson’s disease (PD) symptoms in real-life conditions. Objective: The objective of our study was to explore the feasibility and usability of an mHealth system for continuous and objective real‐life measures of patients’ health and functional mobility, in unsupervised settings. Methods: Patients with a clinical diagnosis of PD, who were able to walk unassisted, and had an Android smartphone were included. Patients were asked to answer a daily survey, to perform three weekly active tests, and to perform a monthly in‐person clinical assessment. Feasibility and usability were explored as primary and secondary outcomes. An exploratory analysis was performed to investigate the correlation between data from the mKinetikos app and clinical assessments. Results: Seventeen participants (85%) completed the study. Sixteen participants (94.1%) showed a medium‐to‐high level of compliance with the mKinetikos system. A 6‐point drop in the total score of the Post‐Study System Usability Questionnaire was observed. Conclusions: Our results support the feasibility of the mKinetikos system for continuous and objective real‐life measures of a patient’s health and functional mobility. The observed correlations of mKinetikos metrics with clinical data seem to suggest that this mHealth solution is a promising tool to support clinical decisions. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Introduction: Remote monitoring technologies (RMTs) can measure cognitive and functional decline objectively at-home, and offer opportunities to measure passively and continuously, possibly improving sensitivity and reducing participant burden in clinical trials. However, there is skepticism that age and cognitive or functional impairment may render participants unable or unwilling to comply with complex RMT protocols. We therefore assessed the feasibility and usability of a complex RMT protocol in all syndromic stages of Alzheimer's disease and in healthy control participants. Methods: For 8 weeks, participants (N = 229) used two activity trackers, two interactive apps with either daily or weekly cognitive tasks, and optionally a wearable camera. A subset of participants participated in a 4-week sub-study (N = 45) using fixed at-home sensors, a wearable EEG sleep headband and a driving performance device. Feasibility was assessed by evaluating compliance and drop-out rates. Usability was assessed by problem rates (e.g., understanding instructions, discomfort, forgetting to use the RMT or technical problems) as discussed during bi-weekly semi-structured interviews. Results: Most problems were found for the active apps and EEG sleep headband. Problem rates increased and compliance rates decreased with disease severity, but the study remained feasible. Conclusions: This study shows that a highly complex RMT protocol is feasible, even in a mild-to-moderate AD population, encouraging other researchers to use RMTs in their study designs. We recommend evaluating the design of individual devices carefully before finalizing study protocols, considering RMTs which allow for real-time compliance monitoring, and engaging the partners of study participants in the research. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Introduction: Objective and continuous monitoring of physical activity over the long-term in the community is perhaps the most important step in the paradigm shift toward evidence-based practice and personalized therapy for successful community integration. With the advancement in technology, physical activity monitors have become the go-to tools for objective and continuous monitoring of everyday physical activity in the community. While these devices are widely used in many patient populations, their use in individuals with acquired brain injury is slowly gaining traction. The first step before using activity monitors in this population is to understand the patient perspective on usability and ease of use of physical activity monitors at different wear locations. However, there are no studies that have looked at the feasibility and patient perspectives on long-term utilization of activity monitors in individuals with acquired brain injury. Methods: This pilot study aims to fill this gap and understand patient-reported aspects of the feasibility of using physical activity monitors for long-term use in community-dwelling individuals with acquired brain injury. Results: This pilot study found that patients with acquired brain injury faced challenges specific to their functional limitations and that the activity monitors worn on the waist or wrist may be better suited in this population. Discussion: The unique wear location-specific challenges faced by individuals with ABI need to be taken into account when selecting wearable activity monitors for long term use in this population.

AB  - Although conventional skin-attachable electronics exhibit good functionalities, their direct attachment (without any adhesive) to human skin with sufficient conformal contact is challenging. Herein, all-solution-processed on-skin electronics based on self-reconfigurable high-weight-per- volume-gelatin (HWVG) film constructed using an effective, biocompatible water absorption-evaporation technique are demonstrated. Completely conformal contact of self-reconfigurable HWVG films is realized by rapidly inducing anisotropic swelling in the perpendicular direction and covering any curvature on the skin without spatial gap or void after shrinking. A sufficiently thin HWVG film (~2 um) exhibited higher adhesion owing to van der Waals force and the carboxylic acid and amine groups in HWVG film form cross-linkages through intermolecular bonds with human skin. Self-reconfigurable HWVG films with high biocompatibility are optimized to afford a superior efficiency of 87.83 % at a concentration of 20 % (w/v) and a storage modulus of 1822 MPa at 36.5 °C. Furthermore, functional nanoelectrodes consisting of self-reconfigurable silver nanowires/HWVG films for high-performance on-skin sensors allowing the detection of sensitive motion and electrophysiological signals, as well as an armband-type sensor system incorporated with a smartphone for health-care monitoring are demonstrated. Outstanding performances, including stability, reliability, flexibility, re-usability, biocompatibility, and permeability of on-skin electronics based on HWVG films can open-up a prospective route to realizing breathable human-machine interfaces based on biocompatible materials and processes. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Introduction: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder which requires complex medication regimens to mitigate motor symptoms. The use of digital health technology systems (DHTSs) to collect mobility and medication data provides an opportunity to objectively quantify the effect of medication on motor performance during day-to-day activities. This insight could inform clinical decision-making, personalise care, and aid self-management. This study investigates the feasibility and usability of a multi-component DHTS to remotely assess self-reported medication adherence and monitor mobility in people with Parkinson's (PwP). Methods: Thirty participants with PD [Hoehn and Yahr stage I (n = 1) and II (n = 29)] were recruited for this cross-sectional study. Participants were required to wear, and where appropriate, interact with a DHTS (smartwatch, inertial measurement unit, and smartphone) for seven consecutive days to assess medication adherence and monitor digital mobility outcomes and contextual factors. Participants reported their daily motor complications [motor fluctuations and dyskinesias (i.e., involuntary movements)] in a diary. Following the monitoring period, participants completed a questionnaire to gauge the usability of the DHTS. Feasibility was assessed through the percentage of data collected, and usability through analysis of qualitative questionnaire feedback. Results: Adherence to each device exceeded 70% and ranged from 73 to 97%. Overall, the DHTS was well tolerated with 17/30 participants giving a score > 75% [average score for these participants = 89%, from 0 (worst) to 100 (best)] for its usability. Usability of the DHTS was significantly associated with age (ρ = −0.560, BCa 95% CI [−0.791, −0.207]). This study identified means to improve usability of the DHTS by addressing technical and design issues of the smartwatch. Feasibility, usability and acceptability were identified as key themes from PwP qualitative feedback on the DHTS. Conclusion: This study highlighted the feasibility and usability of our integrated DHTS to remotely assess medication adherence and monitor mobility in people with mild-to-moderate Parkinson's disease. Further work is necessary to determine whether this DHTS can be implemented for clinical decision-making to optimise management of PwP.

AB  - The fight against pandemics is redesigning the interaction between doctor and patients with a clear request of remote monitoring of biological parameters, reducing the proximity. At this purpose, physical and chemical sensors placed on the skin with wireless reading, can provide the early detection of psycho-physical diseases. A plugplay epidermal patch based on Radiofrequency Identification technology is here proposed for the simultaneous remote reading of multi-physical and-chemical parameters of the skin. The board is designed to improve the usability of the device and to ease the experimentation of different disposable sensors. The resulting prototype made of biocompatible and comfortable encapsulation is readable up to 2 m in battery-Assisted mode and up to 80 cm without embedded power source (passive mode). Sensing experimentation was preliminary performed on the bench through the triple measurement of two chemical sensors (pH and sodium concentration) together with temperature, under controlled conditions.  © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - We report on design-focused inquiry into future multiple sclerosis (MS) healthcare; including a multi-stage design process with experienced MS clinicians, and formative evaluations with people living with MS. MS is a chronic, progressive, and unpredictable inflammatory neurological disease of the central nervous system that affects at least 2.8 million people worldwide. Walking impairments affect up to 85% of people diagnosed with MS. Responding to this, our focus is on design for longitudinally monitoring mobility, and in particular using wearable sensors that generate data on gait metrics to support clinical and self-care decision-making. We contribute to HCI research in three ways: (1) a detailed case study design process, including artifacts; (2) metaphorical framing concepts, with associated use cases illustrated through design scenarios; and (3) understanding of virtual-first practices in rehabilitation medicine that can be translated beyond MS care. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Background: Mobile technology is increasingly prevalent in healthcare, serving various purposes, including remote health monitoring and patient self-management, which could prove beneficial to early hospital discharges. Aims: This study investigates the transitional care program experience facilitating early discharges in a pediatric setting through the use of an easy-to-use mobile medical device (TytoCare™, TytoCare Ltd., Natanya, Israel). Outcomes: This study aims to assess the effectiveness of telehomecare in achieving complete resolution of diseases without readmission, compare the length of stay between intervention and standard care groups, and gather user and professional experiences. Methods: A randomized open-label, controlled pilot study enrolled 102 children, randomly assigned to the telehomecare (TELE) group (n = 51, adopting early hospital discharge with continued home monitoring) or the standard-of-care (STAND) group (n = 51). Primary outcomes include complete disease resolution without readmission. Secondary objectives include recording a shorter length of stay in the intervention group. Surveys on user and professional experiences were conducted. A group of 51 children declining telemedicine services (NO-TELE) was also included. Results: In the TELE group, 100% of children achieved complete disease resolution without readmission, with a median duration of stay of 4 days, significantly shorter than the 7 days in the STAND group (p = 0.01). The telemedicine system demonstrated efficient performance and high satisfaction levels. The NO-TELE group showed no significant differences in demographics or digital technology competence. Perceived benefits of telemedicine included time and cost savings, reduced hospital stays, and technology utility and usability. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that user-friendly mobile medical devices effectively facilitate early hospital discharges in a pediatric setting. These devices serve as a bridge between home and hospital, optimizing care pathways. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - The immune system plays a key role in protecting living beings against bacteria, viruses, and fungi, among other pathogens, which may be harmful and represent a threat to our own health. However, for reasons that are not fully understood, in some people this protective mechanism accidentally attacks the organs and tissues, thus causing inflammation and leads to the development of autoimmune diseases. Remote monitoring of human health involves the use of sensor network technology as a means of capturing patient data, and wearable devices, such as smartwatches, have lately been considered good collectors of biofeedback data, owing to their easy connectivity with a mHealth system. Moreover, the use of gamification may encourage the frequent usage of such devices and behavior changes to improve self-care for autoimmune diseases. This study reports on the use of wearable sensors for inflammation surveillance and autoimmune disease management based on a literature search and evaluation of an app prototype with fifteen stakeholders, in which eight participants were diagnosed with autoimmune or inflammatory diseases and four were healthcare professionals. Of these, six were experts in human–computer interaction to assess critical aspects of user experience. The developed prototype allows the monitoring of autoimmune diseases in pre-, during-, and post-inflammatory crises, meeting the personal needs of people with this health condition. The findings suggest that the proposed prototype—iShU—achieves its purpose and the overall experience may serve as a foundation for designing inflammation surveillance and autoimmune disease management monitoring solutions. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Epileptic seizures are spontaneous events that severely affect the lives of patients due to their recurrence and unpredictability. The integration of new wearable and mobile technologies to collect electroencephalographic (EEG) and extracerebral signals in a portable system might be the solution to prospectively identify times of seizure occurrence or propensity. The performances of several seizure detection devices have been assessed by validated studies, and patient perspectives on wearables have been explored to better match their needs. Despite this, there is a major gap in the literature on long-term, real-life acceptability and performance of mobile technology essential to managing chronic disorders such as epilepsy. Objective: EEG@HOME is an observational, nonrandomized, noninterventional study that aims to develop a new feasible procedure that allows people with epilepsy to independently, continuously, and safely acquire noninvasive variables at home. The data collected will be analyzed to develop a general model to predict periods of increased seizure risk. Methods: A total of 12 adults with a diagnosis of pharmaco-resistant epilepsy and at least 20 seizures per year will be recruited at King's College Hospital, London. Participants will be asked to self-apply an easy and portable EEG recording system (ANT Neuro) to record scalp EEG at home twice daily. From each serial EEG recording, brain network ictogenicity (BNI), a new biomarker of the propensity of the brain to develop seizures, will be extracted. A noninvasive wrist-worn device (Fitbit Charge 3; Fitbit Inc) will be used to collect non-EEG biosignals (heart rate, sleep quality index, and steps), and a smartphone app (Seer app; Seer Medical) will be used to collect data related to seizure occurrence, medication taken, sleep quality, stress, and mood. All data will be collected continuously for 6 months. Standardized questionnaires (the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire and System Usability Scale) will be completed to assess the acceptability and feasibility of the procedure. BNI, continuous wrist-worn sensor biosignals, and electronic survey data will be correlated with seizure occurrence as reported in the diary to investigate their potential values as biomarkers of seizure risk. Results: The EEG@HOME project received funding from Epilepsy Research UK in 2018 and was approved by the Bromley Research Ethics Committee in March 2020. The first participants were enrolled in October 2020, and we expect to publish the first results by the end of 2022. Conclusions: With the EEG@HOME study, we aim to take advantage of new advances in remote monitoring technology, including self-applied EEG, to investigate the feasibility of long-term disease self-monitoring. Further, we hope our study will bring new insights into noninvasively collected personalized risk factors of seizure occurrence and seizure propensity that may help to mitigate one of the most difficult aspects of refractory epilepsy: the unpredictability of seizure occurrence. © Andrea Biondi, Petroula Laiou, Elisa Bruno, Pedro F Viana, Martijn Schreuder, William Hart, Ewan Nurse, Deb K Pal, Mark P Richardson.

AB  - The constant monitoring of glucose levels is crucial for the effective management of diabetes and related conditions. With the advent of advanced technologies, glucose level monitoring systems have evolved to provide accurate and convenient solutions for individuals living with diabetes. The paper presents a comprehensive review of the various technologies and applications employed in glucose level monitoring systems. The earlier method provides an overview of the conventional methods for glucose monitoring, such as fingerstick blood glucose meters. While widely used, these methods have limitations in terms of invasiveness, discomfort, and the inability to capture continuous glucose data. To address these limitations, the proposed method discusses the emergence of non-invasive and minimally invasive techniques. system. The paper explores the integration of glucose level monitoring systems with the Blynk app to monitor the data remotely using smartphone applications and wearable devices which may incorporate the glucose and Heart Rate (HR) sensors and an OLED display for user interface. The benefits of integrations, such as enhanced user experience, remote monitoring, and data accessibility, are highlighted. The proposed wearable devices have paved the way for more accurate, convenient, and personalized glucose monitoring solutions, ultimately empowering individuals with diabetes to manage their condition effectively and lead healthier lives.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Background: Remote monitoring systems have the potential to measure symptoms and treatment effects in people with Parkinson's disease (PwP) in the home environment. However, information about user experience and long-term compliance of such systems in a large group of PwP with relatively severe PD symptoms is lacking. Objective: The aim was to gain insight into user experience and long-term compliance of a smartwatch (to be worn 24/7) and an online dashboard to report falls and receive feedback of data. Methods: We analyzed the data of the “Bringing Parkinson Care Back Home” study, a 1-year observational cohort study in 200 PwP with a fall history. User experience, compliance, and reasons for noncompliance were described. Multiple Cox regression models were used to identify determinants of 1-year compliance. Results: We included 200 PwP (mean age: 69 years, 37% women), of whom 116 (58%) completed the 1-year study. The main reasons for dropping out of the study were technical problems (61 of 118 reasons). Median wear time of the smartwatch was 17.5 h/day. The online dashboard was used by 77% of participants to report falls. Smartphone possession, shorter disease duration, more severe motor symptoms, and less-severe freezing and balance problems, but not age and gender, were associated with a higher likelihood of 1-year compliance. Conclusions: The 1-year compliance with this specific smartwatch was moderate, and the user experience was generally good, except battery life and data transfer. Future studies can build on these findings by incorporating a smartwatch that is less prone to technical issues. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Ventricular assist devices (VADs) are effective therapy for patients with end-stage heart failure. Current VAD controllers offer improved interactivity, yet limitations of the visual, tactile, and auditory interface persist that impact patient experience and quality of life (QoL). This study explores how VAD controllers can be redesigned using a human-centered design approach to enhance the emotional and functional experience of the device for patients. Methods: VAD patients (n = 21), caregivers (n = 4) and healthcare practitioners (n = 24) were interviewed to uncover design opportunities. From this, a series of realistic scenarios to design for emerged. A “design by analogy” method took inspiration from existing consumer products to ideate new functionality for the VAD wearable system, creating concepts for a controller interface and paired wearable device. An additional 15 patients and 2 caregivers were engaged to explore current VAD controller experiences and evaluate the future-state concepts. Results: This research validated the need for increased automation and emergency functionality in VAD controllers, including remote monitoring of data, accurate communication of battery status, and automated medical alerts for critical device alarms. “Manage my health,” “Feeling normal,” “Social belonging,” “Feeling safe,” and “Sense of control” emerged as key patient concerns to be met by future VAD controller designs. Conclusions: The study demonstrated an innovative and relevant approach to improve usability of future VAD peripherals. By considering both emotional and functional perspectives in the design of lifesaving medical devices such as VADs, device manufacturers can uncover new opportunities to improve patient QoL through improved user experiences. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - In Peru, nearly 16% of people over 20 years old suffer from a cardiovascular disease (CVD), which represents the third cause of mortality around the country. The National Statistic and Informatic Institute (INEI) demonstrates that the ratio between the number of patients per doctor is insufficient with 16.8 doctors per 10 thousand inhabitants, whereas it should be near to 23 doctors per 10 thousand inhabitants. A similar situation is replicated in Pontifical Catholic University of Peru (PUCP) medical center, with a ratio of one cardiologist per 37,000 members of the university community. For this reason, it is designed a health-telemonitoring implementation system for electrocardiograph wearable medical devices, based in life-cycle management, in order to prevent pathologies related to CVD, such as critical ischemic symptoms and heart failure. PulseBit Ex (PEX) was used as the wearable electrocardiograph commercial device, while PUCP community and medical center were a reference for the definition of clinical requirements. The results include protocols for performance, electrical safety and usability tests for validation and maintenance stages; the operation and support flowchart consisting of five phases: admission, induction, monitoring, patient report and treatment follow-up; training, preventive and corrective maintenance, and device end of life protocols as well as a website prototype which its function is to connect the device’s interface with the health personnel. Feedback obtained from PUCP Health Center during the validation of the system implementation methodology, allowed to obtain results that suggest the scalability of the project to other Peruvian health centers. In this sense, the present work achieves the objectives initially set and leaves a precedent for possible future research, in local and international context. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Although telehealth, and in particular RPM, have demonstrated to drive many benefits, such as reduction in cost and hospital-acquired infections, previous research has shown many usability challenges when patients operate a medical device without supervision of a medical professional. To combat this issue, the Pi-CON methodology is applied to develop a novel sensor with the objective to continuously acquire a patient’s vital signs from a distance, without the need to attach any markers or sensors to the patient, and with limited user interaction required. Pi-CON stands for passive, continuous and non-contact, and describes a way to improve the user experience for patients or caregivers that have a need to perform a vital signs measurement themselves, without the presence of a medical professional. The developed sensor utilises radar and optical sensing technologies and transmits acquired data to a cloud-based service where it can be viewed in near real-time by the patient or family members from anywhere via an intuitive user interface. This user interface, as well as the sensor itself were designed based on design needs and requirements to adhere to the user-centered design process. The development of the sensor, including utilised technologies, components, and the user interface are presented, including inspirations for future work. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Fueled by ongoing digitization efforts, manufacturing is currently undergoing a transformational process towards interconnected machinery and workforce, which enables a wide range of interactive monitoring and controlling applications. Whereas existing user-centered work addressed remote monitoring from office workplaces, it remains unclear how manufacturing workers experience and adopt machinery monitoring apps on mobile and wearable devices. To close this gap, we conducted a four-week field study in a running factory to study workers’ overall user experience and acceptance of such monitoring apps, the subjective impact on their work routines, and their preferred device type. Under productive operation, 11 manufacturing workers used functional application prototypes on smartphones and smartwatches to receive notifications of machine incidents. In 22 individual interviews and two focus groups, we collected the participants’ impressions and assessments. Based on these results, we derive a set of recommendations for designing and deploying machinery monitoring apps for manufacturing workers. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - Remote Patient Monitoring has enjoyed strong growth to new heights driven by several factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic or advances in technology, allowing consumers and patients to continuously record health data by themselves. This does not come without its challenges, however. A literature review was completed and highlights usability gaps when using wearables or home use medical devices in a virtual environment. Based on these findings, the Pi-CON methodology was applied to close these gaps by utilizing a novel sensor that allows the acquisition of vital signs at a distance, without any sensors touching the patient. Pi-CON stands for passive, continuous and non-contact, and describes the ability to acquire vital signs continuously and passively, with limited user interaction. The preference of vital sign acquisition with a newly developed sensor was tested and compared to vital sign tests taken with patient generated health-data devices (ear thermometer, pulse oximeter) measuring heart rate, respiratory rate and body temperature. In addition, the amount of operator errors and the user interfaces were tested and compared. Results show that participants preferred vital signs acquisition with the novel sensor and the developed user interface of the sensor. Results also revealed that participants had a mean error of.85 per vital sign measurement with the patient-generated health data devices and.33 with the developed sensor, confirming the beneficial impact available when using the developed sensor based on the Pi-CON methodology. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Human activity recognition (HAR) with wearable devices has shown superior usability in everyday life tracking and healthcare monitoring in recent years. To solve the existing challenges of weak sensor durability and difficulty capturing dynamic features of traditional wearable devices based on the long short-term memory neural network (LSTM), a new HAR system based on a pedal wearable device is proposed by utilizing a novel differential spatio-temporal LSTM (DST-LSTM) method. The pedal wearable device is embedded in the tongue area of the general footwear to obtain pedal musculoskeletal response (PMR) data of dorsum pedis. Based on the PMR data, the DST-LSTM is developed to classify five typical activity statuses as standing, sitting, floor walking, down the stairs and up the stairs. First, the dynamic differential information of the PMR data is taken into consideration to build a new LSTM unit. Second, the spatial relationship features of the PMR data are obtained by multi-head graph attention networks (GAT). Third, a novel spatial gate is added to the new LSTM unit to filter irrelevant spatial features and get valid information. The effectiveness and superiority of both the pedal wearable device and the DST-LSTM method are validated by comparison with the state-of-the-art methods and wearable devices. © 2022

AB  - Introduction: Atrial Fibrillation (AF), the most commonly sustained arrhythmia, affects approximately 200,000 Canadians and costs an annual $815 million to the Ontario provincial healthcare system. The current model for chronic AF management (favouring infrequent hospital visits) in combination with the challenge of detecting cardiac arrythmias provides opportunity for wearable devices to improve quality of care. Physicians must be aware of available wearable devices, their accuracy, validity, and potential to improve patient care. Methods: PubMed and Google Scholar databases were searched for primary studies involving AF and wearable devices published from database inception to 2020. Due to the heterogeneity of the findings, quantitative synthesis of the information could not be conducted. A narrative synthesis was performed for the obtained results, including a discussion of apparent trends and common study outcome measures: sensitivity, specificity, positive-, and negative-predictive-values. The narrative included comparisons to similar reviews and a discussion on both the current and future research directions. Results: The systematic search produced 214 studies, of which, 7 met the pre-determined eligibility criteria. The studies were published between 2018-2020 in 5 countries. Each eligible study was described and summarized; devices investigated include the Apple Watch with Kardia Band (Atrial fibrillation-sensing watch; AFSW), Huawei wearable devices (Honor 4 wristband, Honor Watch or Watch GT), CardioTracker (CART) + a pulse oximeter, and the RITMA system. Discussion: This systematic review comprehensively examined wearable devices used to deliver care for patients with AF. It was found that currently available wearable technologies for AF detection and management varied greatly in their accuracy, application settings, and accessibility. With technological advancements and further exploration into AF devices’ usability, widespread implementation of wearable technology in AF care is plausible. Successful application of these technologies can improve AF care and contribute to a significant reduction in AF-related healthcare costs. Conclusion: There are many devices available for AF care that show promise for certain applications. Additionally, there remains a demand for large-scale, high-quality research in this field to investigate the advantages and shortcomings of various devices that have shown promise in preliminary research. Future research should focus on randomized controlled trials to generate conclusive findings for wearable technologies in AF. © Ervis Musa, Adam Z. Levitan, Gavin Hughes. (2021).

AB  - Background: Electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring in daily life is essential for effective management of cardiovascular disease, a leading cause of death. Wearable ECG measurement systems in the form of clothing have been proposed to replace Holter monitors used for clinical ECG monitoring; however, they have limitations in daily use because they compress the upper body and, in doing so, cause discomfort during wear. Objective: The purpose of this study was to develop a wireless wearable ECG monitoring system that includes a textile ECG electrode that can be applied to the lining of pants and can be used in the same way that existing lower clothing is worn, without compression to the upper body. Methods: A textile electrode with stretchable characteristics was fabricated by knitting a conductive yarn together with polyester-polyurethane fiber, which was then coated with silver compound; an ECG electrode was developed by placing it on an elastic band in a modified limb lead configuration. In addition, a system with analog-to-digital conversion, wireless communication, and a smartphone app was developed, allowing users to be able to check and store their own ECGs in real time. A signal processing algorithm was also developed to remove noise from the obtained signal and to calculate the heart rate. To evaluate the ECG and heart rate measurement performance of the developed module, a comparative evaluation with a commercial device was performed. ECGs were measured for 5 minutes each in standing, sitting, and lying positions; the mean absolute percentage errors of heart rates measured with both systems were then compared. Results: The system was developed in the form of a belt buckle with a size of 53 × 45 × 12 mm (width × height × depth) and a weight of 23 g. In a qualitative evaluation, it was confirmed that the P-QRS-T waveform was clearly observed in ECGs obtained with the wearable system. From the results of the heart rate estimation, the developed system could track changes in heart rate as calculated by a commercial ECG measuring device; in addition, the mean absolute percentage errors of heart rates were 1.80%, 2.84%, and 2.48% in the standing, sitting, and lying positions, respectively. Conclusions: The developed system was able to effectively measure ECG and calculate heart rate simply through being worn as existing clothing without upper body pressure. It is anticipated that general usability can be secured through further evaluation under more diverse conditions. © Danbi Gwon, Hakyung Cho, Hangsik Shin.

AB  - Background: The use of wearable technology offers a promising home-based self-directed option for upper limb training. Although product usability is a crucial aspect of users’ acceptance of a wearable device, usability studies in wearable devices are rare, with most studies focusing primarily on clinical validity. Objective: This study aimed to explore the usability of a wristwatch device called “Smart reminder” for home-based upper limb telerehabilitation for persons with stroke. Methods: Eleven stroke participants used the proposed wristwatch for at least two weeks and underwent a home-based telerehabilitation program. A mixed-methods design was used to explore the usability of the wristwatch. Quantitative data were collected through the System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire, and the participants’ rate of therapy compliance (gathered from the device) was reported descriptively. In addition, qualitative data were collected through semi-structured interviews with the participants and were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: The results demonstrated that the usability of the proposed wristwatch and telerehabilitation system was rated highly by the participants, with a high SUS mean score of 84.3 (12.3) and high therapy compliance rate (mean = 91%). Qualitatively, all participants reported positive experiences with the wristwatch and indicated keenness to use it again. Participants reported physical improvements and felt motivated to exercise after using the wristwatch. They found the device easy and convenient and appreciated the remote monitoring function. Meanwhile, they highlighted critical considerations for the design of the device and program, including technical support, a wearable design of the device, graded exercise content according to ability, and flexibility in exercise schedules. Finally, they suggested that an interim review with the therapist on their progress might help them continue using the wristwatch. Conclusions: This study's results supported the proposed wearable device's usability and showed strong acceptance by the participants for using it as a home-based upper limb telerehabilitation intervention. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - Background: Smart home and telemonitoring technologies have often been suggested to assist health care workers in supporting older people to age in place. However, there is limited research examining diverse information needs of different groups of health care workers and their access to appropriate information technologies. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the issues associated with using technologies that connect older people to their health care providers to support aging in place and enhance older people's health and well-being. Methods: Seven focus group discussions were conducted comprising 44 health care professionals who provided clinic-based or in-home services to community-dwelling older people. Participants were asked about their information needs and how technology could help them support older people to age in place. The recordings of the sessions were transcribed and thematically analyzed. Results: The perspectives varied between the respondents who worked in primary care clinics and those who worked in community-based services. Three overarching themes were identified. The first theme was “access to technology and systems,” which examined the different levels of technology in use and the problems that various groups of health care professionals had in accessing information about their patients. Primary care professionals had access to good internal information systems but they experienced poor integration with other health care providers. The community-based teams had poor access to technology. The second theme was “collecting and sharing of information,” which focused on how technology might be used to provide them with more information about their patients. Primary care teams were interested in telemonitoring for specific clinical indicators but they wanted the information to be preprocessed. Community-based teams were more concerned about gaining information on the patients' social environment. The third theme was that all respondents identified similar “barriers to uptake”: cost and funding issues, usability of systems by older people, and information security and privacy concerns. Conclusions: The participants perceived the potential benefits of technologies, but they were concerned that the information they received should be preprocessed and integrated with current information systems and tailored to the older people's unique and changing situations. Several management and governance issues were identified, which needed to be resolved to enable the widespread integration of these technologies into the health care system. The disconnected nature of the current information architecture means that there is no clear way for sensor data from telemonitoring and smart home devices to be integrated with other patient information. Furthermore, cost, privacy, security, and usability barriers also need to be resolved. This study highlights the importance and the complexity of management and governance of systems to collect and disseminate such information. Further research into the requirements of all stakeholder groups and how the information can be processed and disseminated is required. © Inga Hunter, Phoebe Elers, Caroline Lockhart, Hans Guesgen, Amardeep Singh, Dick Whiddett.

AB  - This study primarily aimed to explore the capabilities of digitalisation in the healthcare context, focusing on a specific disease. In this case, the study examined the potential of remote monitoring of gait to address the sensitivity of multiple sclerosis progression to gait characteristics by adopting a non-invasive approach to remotely quantify gait disturbances in a patient's daily life. To better understand the managerial aspects associated with this approach, the researchers conducted a literature review along with a set of semi-structured interviews. The target population included MS patients as well as the key agents involved in their care: patients' family members, neurologists, MS nurses, physiotherapists, medical directors, and pharmacist. The study identifies the perceived barriers and drivers that could contribute to the successful deployment of PSS remote gait monitoring as a healthcare service: i) At mega-level governance. Implications on privacy and security data are notable barriers missing on the speech. ii) At macro level, funding is highlighted as main barrier. The cost and lack of health system subsidies may render initiatives unsustainable, as emphasised by the interviewees. iii) At meso level, useable data is recognised as a driver. The data collection process can align with diverse interests to create value and business opportunities for the ecosystem actors, enhance care, attract stakeholders, such as insurers and pharma, and form partnerships. iv) At micro-level processes, we find two potential barriers: wearable device and app usability (comfort, navigation, efficiency) and organisational/behavioural aspects (training, digital affinity, skills), which are crucial for value creation in innovation ecosystems among patients and healthcare professionals. Finally, we find an interesting gap in the literature and interviews. Stakeholders' limited awareness of technological demands, especially from information technologies, for a successful long-term service, can be consider two key barriers for PSS. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Background: Continuous monitoring of ECG, respiratory rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, cardiac output, and cardiac index is important in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) admitted to the intensive cardiac care unit (ICCU). However, monitoring these parameters in this setting and in these patients using noninvasive, wireless devices has not been conducted so far. We aimed to assess the use of a novel noninvasive continuous monitoring device in STEMI patients admitted to the ICCU. Methods: Participants included STEMI patients that were admitted to the ICCU after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI). Patients were continuously monitored using a novel wearable chest patch monitor. Results: Fifteen patients with STEMI who underwent PPCI were included in this study. The median age was 52.8 years, the majority were males, and the median body mass index (BMI) was 25.7. Monitoring lasted for 66 ± 16 hours, and included the automatic collection and recording of all vitals, freeing the nursing staff to focus on other tasks. The user experience of nurses as reflected in filled questionnaires showed high satisfaction rates in all aspects. Conclusion: A novel noninvasive, wireless device showed high feasibility in continuously monitoring multiple crucial parameters in STEMI patients admitted to the ICCU after PPCI. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - Parkinson's disease is a degenerative neurological disorder that impairs motor functions and is accompanied by a wide range of non-motor symptoms, such as sleep problems. Parkinsonism is assessed during clinical evaluations and via self-administered diaries and, based on these, the required medication therapies are provided to lessen symptoms. Tri-axial accelerometers and gyroscopes have the potential utility to objectively assess the patient's condition and aid clinicians in their decision-making. People with Parkinson's often have significant abnormalities in blood pressure due to comorbid age-related cardiovascular disease and orthostatic hypotension, which result in blurred vision, dizziness, and falls. Frequent blood pressure monitoring may aid in the evaluation of such events and differentiate Parkinson's disease symptoms from those originated by hypotension. In the present paper, a novel technology for the remote monitoring of Parkinsonian symptoms is presented: the WESAA system. It consists of two devices, worn on the wrist and ankle; its main function is to record accelerations and angular velocities from these body parts, together with photoplethysmograph and electrocardiogram data. This information can be elaborated offline to measure common Parkinson's disease motor symptoms (e.g., tremor, bradykinesia, and dyskinesia), as well as gait speed, sleep-wake cycles, and cuff-less blood pressure measurements. The overall system requirements, market overview, industrial design and ergonomics, system development, user experience, early results of the gathered inertial raw data, and validation of the photoplethysmograph and electrocardiogram signal waveforms are all thoroughly discussed. The developed technology satisfies all system requirements, and the sensors adopted provided outcomes comparable with gold standard techniques. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Small-scale and high-performance energy storage devices have drawn tremendous attention with their portable, lightweight, and multi-functionalized features. Here, we present a foldable supercapacitor with affordable flexibility by adopting a developed design and electrode material system as a way to extend usability. Notably, to resolve the limited energy density of conventional capacitors, we successfully synthesize the CoO/NiCo-layered double hydroxide (LDH) core–shell nanostructure on Ni framework as a cathode material. Further, glucose-based activated carbon (GBAC) is utilized for the anode. The CoO/NiCo-LDH electrodes exhibited a high specific capacitance of ∼284.8 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1, and GBAC delivers a high specific capacitance of ∼166 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. In the following, the combinatorial integration of these materials enabled the asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) to increase the energy density by enhancing the capacitance and the voltage window, in which a hydrogel-based electrolyte was facilitated for the foldable and wearable capability. The energy density of the ASC device was ∼24.9 Wh kg−1 at a power density of ∼779.5 W kg−1 with a voltage window of ∼1.6 V. As demonstrated, a self-powered energy source was demonstrated by a serially connected multi-ASC device with a help of a commercial solar cell, which was employed for powering wearable healthcare monitoring devices, including personal alarms for patients and recording the human body's electrical signals. The present work offers a viable approach to preparing potential candidates for high-performance electrodes of supercapacitors with deformable configurations to extend the powering capability of other electronic devices with physical functionalities used in wearable electronics. © 2022

AB  - Background: As a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Sydney Local Health District in New South Wales, Australia, launched the rpavirtual program, the first full-scale virtual hospital in Australia, to remotely monitor and follow up stable patients with COVID-19. As part of the intervention, a pulse oximeter wearable device was delivered to patients to monitor their oxygen saturation levels, a critical indicator of COVID-19 patient deterioration. Understanding users’ perceptions toward the device is fundamental to assessing its usability and acceptability and contributing to the effectiveness of the intervention, but no research to date has explored the user experience of the pulse oximeter for remote monitoring in this setting. Objective: This study aimed to explore the use, performance, and acceptability of the pulse oximeter by clinicians and patients in rpavirtual during COVID-19. Methods: Semistructured interviews and usability testing were conducted. Stable adult patients with COVID-19 (aged ≥18 years) who used the pulse oximeter and were monitored by rpavirtual, and rpavirtual clinicians monitoring these patients were interviewed. Clinicians could be nurses, doctors, or staff who were part of the team that assisted patients with the use of the pulse oximeter. Usability testing was conducted with patients who had the pulse oximeter when they were contacted. Interviews were coded using the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability. Usability testing was conducted using a think-aloud protocol. Data were collected until saturation was reached. Results: Twenty-one patients (average age 51, SD 13 years) and 15 clinicians (average age 41, SD 11 years) completed the interview. Eight patients (average age 51, SD 13 years) completed the usability testing. All participants liked the device and thought it was easy to use. They also had a good understanding of how to use the device and the device’s purpose. Patients’ age and device use–related characteristics (eg, the warmth of hands and hand steadiness) were identified by users as factors negatively impacting the accurate use of the pulse oximeter. Conclusions: Patients and clinicians had very positive perceptions of the pulse oximeter for COVID-19 remote monitoring, indicating high acceptability and usability of the device. However, factors that may impact the accuracy of the device should be considered when delivering interventions using the pulse oximeter for remote monitoring. Targeted instructions about the use of the device may be necessary for specific populations (eg, older people and patients unfamiliar with technology). Further research should focus on the integration of the pulse oximeter data into electronic medical records for real-time and secure patient monitoring. ©Andrea Torres-Robles, Karen Allison, Simon K Poon, Miranda Shaw, Owen Hutchings, Warwick J Britton, Andrew Wilson, Melissa Baysari.

AB  - The present work introduces ShoulPhy: a digital application, which includes a rehabilitation protocol for the treatment of shoulder impingement syndrome (SIS). ShoulPhy, short for Shoulder Physiotherapy enables the development of a patient-centred physiotherapy program and the remote monitoring of the patient’s adherence to the program, both in the clinic and daily life. The application provides a quantitative and effective evaluation of the therapeutic activity and functional level, through the use of wearable devices. The final aim was to facilitate the functional physical recovery and maintenance gained through the rehabilitation program, thus leading to a complete return to sport and routine activities. ShoulPhy underwent small scale tests both on healthy subjects and clinicians, which, in addition to evaluating the technical reliability of the system, assessed the usability and acceptance by clinicians and patients. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Recent World Health Organization reports propose wearable devices to collect information on activity and walking speed as innovative health indicators. However, mainstream consumer-grade tracking devices and smartphone apps are often inaccurate and require long-term acceptability assessment. Objective: Our aim is to assess the user acceptability of an instrumented shoe insole in frail older adults. This device monitors participants'walking speed and differentiates active walking from shuffling after step length calibration. Methods: A multiphase evaluation has been designed: 9 older adults were evaluated in a living lab for a day, 3 older adults were evaluated at home for a month, and a prospective randomized trial included 35 older adults at home for 3 months. A qualitative research design using face-to-face and phone semistructured interviews was performed. Our hypothesis was that this shoe insole was acceptable in monitoring long-term outdoor and indoor walking. The primary outcome was participants' acceptability, measured by a qualitative questionnaire and average time of insole wearing per day. The secondary outcome described physical frailty evolution in both groups. Results: Living lab results confirmed the importance of a multiphase design study with participant involvement. Participants proposed insole modifications. Overall acceptability had mixed results: low scores for reliability (2.1 out of 6) and high scores for usability (4.3 out of 6) outcomes. The calibration phase raised no particular concern. During the field test, a majority of participants (mean age 79 years) were very (10/16) or quite satisfied (3/16) with the insole's comfort at the end of the follow-up. Participant insole acceptability evolved as follows: 63% (12/19) at 1 month, 50% (9/18) at 2 months, and 75% (12/16) at 3 months. A total of 9 participants in the intervention group discontinued the intervention because of technical issues. All participants equipped for more than a week reported wearing the insole every day at 1 month, 83% (15/18) at 2 months, and 94% (15/16) at 3 months for 5.8, 6.3, and 5.1 hours per day, respectively. Insole data confirmed that participants effectively wore the insole without significant decline during follow-up for an average of 13.5 days per 4 months and 5.6 hours per day. For secondary end points, the change in frailty parameters or quality of life did not differ for those randomly assigned to the intervention group compared to usual care. Conclusions: Our study reports acceptability data on an instrumented insole in indoor and outdoor walking with remote monitoring in frail older adults under real-life conditions. To date, there is limited data in this population set. This thin instrumentation, including a flexible battery, was a technical challenge and seems to provide an acceptable solution over time that is valued by participants. However, users still raised certain acceptability issues. Given the growing interest in wearable health care devices, these results will be useful for future developments. © 2021 JMIR Publications.

AB  - Background: With the increase in concern for deaths and illness related to the increase in temperature globally, there is a growing need for real-time monitoring of workers for heat stress indicators. The purpose of this study was to determine the usability of the Slate Safety (SS) wearable physiological monitoring system. Methods: Twenty nurses performed a common task in a moderate or hot environment while wearing the SS device, the Polar 10 monitor, and having taken the e-Celsius ingestible pill. Data from each device was compared for correlation and accuracy. Results: High correlation was determined between the SS wearable device and the Polar 10 system (0.926) and the ingestible pill (0.595). The SS was comfortable to wear and easily monitored multiple participants from a distance. Conclusions: The Slate Safety wearable device demonstrated accuracy in measuring core temperature and heart rate while not restricting the motion of the worker, and provided a remote monitoring platform for physiological parameters. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Mobile health (mHealth) technologies, such as wearable sensors, smart health devices, and mobile apps, that are capable of supporting pregnancy care are emerging. Although mHealth could be used to facilitate the tracking of health changes during pregnancy, challenges remain in data collection compliance and technology engagement among pregnant women. Understanding the interests, preferences, and requirements of pregnant women and those of clinicians is needed when designing and introducing mHealth solutions for supporting pregnant women’s monitoring of health and risk factors throughout their pregnancy journey. Objective: This study aims to understand clinicians’ and pregnant women’s perceptions on the potential use of mHealth, including factors that may influence their engagement with mHealth technologies and the implications for technology design and implementation. Methods: A qualitative study using semistructured interviews was conducted with 4 pregnant women, 4 postnatal women, and 13 clinicians working in perinatal care. Results: Clinicians perceived the potential benefit of mHealth in supporting different levels of health and well-being monitoring, risk assessment, and care provision in pregnancy care. Most pregnant and postnatal female participants were open to the use of wearables and health monitoring devices and were more likely to use these technologies if they knew that clinicians were monitoring their data. Although it was acknowledged that some pregnancy-related medical conditions are suitable for an mHealth model of remote monitoring, the clinical and technical challenges in the introduction of mHealth for pregnancy care were also identified. Incorporating appropriate health and well-being measures, intelligently detecting any abnormalities, and providing tailored information for pregnant women were the critical aspects, whereas usability and data privacy were among the main concerns of the participants. Moreover, this study highlighted the challenges of engaging pregnant women in longitudinal mHealth monitoring, the additional work required for clinicians to monitor the data, and the need for an evidence-based technical solution. Conclusions: Clinical, technical, and practical factors associated with the use of mHealth to monitor health and well-being in pregnant women need to be considered during the design and feasibility evaluation stages. Technical solutions and appropriate strategies for motivating pregnant women are critical to supporting their long-term data collection compliance and engagement with mHealth technology during pregnancy. ©Jane Li, David Silvera-Tawil, Marlien Varnfield, M Sazzad Hussain, Vanitha Math.

AB  - Pregnancy health monitoring systems enable women to access remote quality care during pregnancy. The integration of wearable devices has positively impacted maternal healthcare monitoring technologies. Maternal health requires a comprehensive structure permitting pregnant women to be monitored continuously. As a result, the necessity to assess its usability grows. A web-based pregnancy monitoring system that utilizes Internet-of-Things (IoT) wearables such as a smartwatch, blood pressure device, and fetal doppler to aid in vital sign monitoring was developed to evaluate its usability. With this, the system aimed to identify what usability principle is the most significant in pregnancy health monitoring systems. Profiling and treatment modules were implemented wherein a doctor-patient consultation and journal-styled milestone feature were made available to aid pregnant women in their pregnancy health journey. A mobile-based application was also developed to allow the syncing of vital sign information as part of the treatment module. The system's functionality was tested for two iterations to ensure that all features could meet all specific objectives. The plan was then deployed for usability evaluation wherein the five usability categories according to the Nielsen Model Standard: learnability, efficiency, memorability, error, and satisfaction were assessed. Based on the results obtained, user expectations were met overall. The results show that the system is easy to use, navigate, and remember. Finally, among the five (5) components based on Nielsen's usability components, efficiency had the highest mean and thus making it the most significant usability component.  © 2023 ACM.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Remote patient monitoring (RPM) of vital signs and symptoms for lung transplant recipients (LTRs) has become increasingly relevant in many situations. Nevertheless, RPM research integrating multisensory home monitoring in LTRs is scarce. We developed a novel multisensory home monitoring device and tested it in the context of COVID-19 vaccinations. We hypothesize that multisensory RPM and smartphone-based questionnaire feedback on signs and symptoms will be well accepted among LTRs. To assess the usability and acceptability of a remote monitoring system consisting of wearable devices, including home spirometry and a smartphone-based questionnaire application for symptom and vital sign monitoring using wearable devices, during the first and second SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Materials and Methods: Observational usability pilot study for six weeks of home monitoring with the COVIDA Desk for LTRs. During the first week after the vaccination, intensive monitoring was performed by recording data on physical activity, spirometry, temperature, pulse oximetry and self-reported symptoms, signs and additional measurements. During the subsequent days, the number of monitoring assessments was reduced. LTRs reported on their perceptions of the usability of the monitoring device through a purpose-designed questionnaire. Results: Ten LTRs planning to receive the first COVID-19 vaccinations were recruited. For the intensive monitoring study phase, LTRs recorded symptoms, signs and additional measurements. The most frequent adverse events reported were local pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance and headache. The duration of these symptoms was 5–8 days post-vaccination. Adherence to the main monitoring devices was high. LTRs rated usability as high. The majority were willing to continue monitoring. Conclusions: The COVIDA Desk showed favorable technical performance and was well accepted by the LTRs during the vaccination phase of the pandemic. The feasibility of the RPM system deployment was proven by the rapid recruitment uptake, technical performance (i.e., low number of errors), favorable user experience questionnaires and detailed individual user feedback. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Chronic pain is a disabling symptom frequently reported in patients with breast cancer with a prevalence ranging from 25% to 60%, representing a major health issue. It has negative consequences on health status, causing psychological distress and affecting quality of life. Furthermore, the clinical management of chronic pain is often inadequate, and many patients do not benefit from the administration of pharmacological treatments. Alternative therapeutic options have been implemented to improve the psychophysical well-being of patients, including neuromodulation and complementary interventions. Objective: We aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a home care strategy combining computerized rehabilitation, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and remote telemonitoring via a web-based platform in patients with breast cancer suffering for chronic pain. Methods: A web-based structured survey aimed at monitoring chronic pain and its effect on psychological functions will be delivered to patients with breast cancer through social media and email. In total, 42 patients with breast cancer affected by chronic pain will be recruited during the medical screening visit. The patients will be randomly divided into 3 treatment groups that will carry out either tDCS only, exercise therapy only, or a combination of both over a 3-week period. All the treatments will be delivered at the patients’ home through the use of a system including a tablet, wearable inertial sensors, and a tDCS programmable medical device. Using web-based questionnaires, the perception of pain (based on the pain self-efficacy questionnaire, visual analogue scale, pain catastrophizing scale, and brief pain inventory) and psychological variables (based on the hospital and anxiety depression scale and 12-item short form survey) will be assessed at the beginning of treatment, 1 week after the start of treatment, at the end of treatment, 1 month after the start of treatment, and 3 months after the start of treatment. The system’s usability (based on the mobile app rating scale and system usability scale) and its involvement in the decision-making process (based on the 9-item shared decision-making questionnaire) will be also evaluated. Finally, at the end of the treatment, a digital focus group will be conducted with the 42 patients to explore their unexpressed needs and preferences concerning treatment. Results: The study project is scheduled to start in June 2023, and it is expected to be completed by August 2025. Conclusions: We expect that the combination of tDCS and telemedicine programs will reduce pain perceived by patients with breast cancer and improve their mental well-being more effectively than single interventions. Furthermore, we assume that this home-based approach will also improve patients’ participation in routine clinical care, reducing disparities in accessing health care processes. This integrated home care strategy could be useful for patients with breast cancer who cannot find relief from chronic pain with pharmacological treatments or for those who have limited access to care due to poor mobility or geographical barriers, thus increasing the patients’ empowerment and reducing health care costs. ©Lorenzo Conti, Chiara Marzorati, Roberto Grasso, Roberta Ferrucci, Alberto Priori, Francesca Mameli, Fabiana Ruggiero, Gabriella Pravettoni.

AB  - Secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD), the leading cause of morbidity and mortality, is critical to improving health outcomes and quality of life in our aging population. As mobile health (mHealth) technology gains universal leverage and popularity, it is becoming more user-friendly for older adults and an adjunct to manage CVD risk and improve overall cardiovascular health. With the rapid advances in mHealth technology and increasing technological engagement of older adults, a comprehensive understanding of the current literature and knowledge of gaps and barriers surrounding the impact of mHealth on secondary CVD prevention is essential. After a systematic review of the literature, 26 studies that used mHealth for secondary CVD prevention focusing on lifestyle behavior change and medication adherence in cohorts with a mean age of ≥60 years were identified. Improvements in health behaviors and medication adherence were observed, particularly when there was a short message service (ie, texting) component involved. Although mobile technologies are becoming more mainstream and are starting to blend more seamlessly with standard health care, there are still distinct barriers that limit implementation particularly in older adults, including affordability, usability, privacy, and security issues. Furthermore, studies on the type of mHealth that is the most effective for older adults with longer study duration are essential as the field continues to grow. As our population ages, identifying and implementing effective, widely accepted, cost-effective, and time-efficient mHealth interventions to improve CVD health in a vulnerable demographic group should be a top health priority. © 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

AB  - Background: Patients with chronic respiratory diseases and those in the postdischarge period following hospitalization because of COVID-19 are particularly vulnerable, and little is known about the changes in their symptoms and physiological parameters. Continuous remote monitoring of physiological parameters and symptom changes offers the potential for timely intervention, improved patient outcomes, and reduced health care costs. Objective: This study investigated whether a real-time multimodal program using commercially available wearable technology, home-based Bluetooth-enabled spirometers, finger pulse oximeters, and smartphone apps is feasible and acceptable for patients with chronic respiratory diseases, as well as the value of low-burden, long-term passive data collection. Methods: In a 3-arm prospective observational cohort feasibility study, we recruited 60 patients from the Royal Free Hospital and University College Hospital. These patients had been diagnosed with interstitial lung disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or post–COVID-19 condition (n=20 per group) and were followed for 180 days. This study used a comprehensive remote monitoring system designed to provide real-time and relevant data for both patients and clinicians. Data were collected using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture; Vanderbilt University) periodic surveys, Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapses–base active app questionnaires, wearables, finger pulse oximeters, smartphone apps, and Bluetooth home-based spirometry. The feasibility of remote monitoring was measured through adherence to the protocol, engagement during the follow-up period, retention rate, acceptability, and data integrity. Results: Lowest-burden passive data collection methods, via wearables, demonstrated superior adherence, engagement, and retention compared with active data collection methods, with an average wearable use of 18.66 (SD 4.69) hours daily (77.8% of the day), 123.91 (SD 33.73) hours weekly (72.6% of the week), and 463.82 (SD 156.70) hours monthly (64.4% of the month). Highest-burden spirometry tasks and high-burden active app tasks had the lowest adherence, engagement, and retention, followed by low-burden questionnaires. Spirometry and active questionnaires had the lowest retention at 0.5 survival probability, indicating that they were the most burdensome. Adherence to and quality of home spirometry were analyzed; of the 7200 sessions requested, 4248 (59%) were performed. Of these, 90.3% (3836/4248) were of acceptable quality according to American Thoracic Society grading. Inclusion of protocol holidays improved retention measures. The technologies used were generally well received. Conclusions: Our findings provide evidence supporting the feasibility and acceptability of remote monitoring for capturing both subjective and objective data from various sources for respiratory diseases. The high engagement level observed with passively collected data suggests the potential of wearables for long-term, user-friendly remote monitoring in respiratory disease management. The unique piloting of certain features such as protocol holidays, alert notifications for missing data, and flexible support from the study team provides a reference for future studies in this field. © Malik A Althobiani, Yatharth Ranjan, Joseph Jacob, Michele Orini, Richard James Butler Dobson, Joanna C Porter, John R Hurst, Amos A Folarin.

AB  - Symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD) can be controlled well, but treatment often requires expert judgment. Telemedicine and sensor-based assessments can allow physicians to better observe the evolvement of symptoms over time, in particular with motor fluctuations. In addition, they potentially allow less frequent visits to the expert’s office and facilitate care in rural areas. A variety of systems with different strengths and shortcomings has been investigated in recent years. We designed a multimodal telehealth intervention (TelePark) to mitigate the shortcomings of individual systems and assessed the feasibility of our approach in 12 patients with PD over 12 weeks in preparation for a larger randomized controlled trial. TelePark uses video visits, a smartphone app, a camera system, and wearable sensors. Structured training included setting up the equipment in patients’ homes and group-based online training. Usability was assessed by questionnaires and semi-standardized telephone interviews. Overall, 11 out of 12 patients completed the trial (5 female, 6 male). Mean age was 65 years, mean disease duration 7 years, mean MoCA score 27. Adherence was stable throughout the study and 79% for a short questionnaire administered every second day, 62% for medication confirmation, and 33% for an electronic Hauser diary. Quality of life did not change in the course of the study, and a larger cohort will be required to determine the effect on motor symptoms. Interviews with trial participants identified motivations to use such systems and areas for improvements. These insights can be helpful in designing similar trials. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Objective: Digital devices have demonstrated benefits to patients with chronic and neurodegenerative diseases. But when patients use medical devices in their homes, the technologies have to fit into their lives. We investigated the technology acceptance of seven digital devices for home use. Methods: We conducted 60 semi-structured interviews with participants of a larger device study on their views on the acceptability of seven devices. Transcriptions were analysed using qualitative content analysis. Results: Based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology, we evaluated effort, facilitating conditions, performance expectancy and social influence of each device. In the effort category, five themes emerged: (a) the hassle to use the device; (b) its usability; (c) comfort; (d) disturbance to daily life; and (e) problems during usage. Facilitating conditions consisted of five themes: (a) expectations regarding a device; (b) quality of the instructions; (c) insecurities with usage; (d) possibilities of optimization; and (e) possibilities to use the device longer. Regarding performance expectancy, we identified three themes: (a) insecurities with the performance of a device; (b) feedback; and (c) motivation for using a device. In the social influence category, three themes emerged: (a) reactions of peers; (b) concerns with the visibility of a device; and (c) concerns regarding data privacy. Conclusions: We identify key factors that determine the acceptability of medical devices for home use from the participants’ perspective. These include low effort of use, minor disruptions to their daily lives and good support from the study team. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - Purpose: Wearable devices are progressively becoming an available tool for continuous seizure detection. Motivation to use wearables is not only driven by the accuracy and reliability of the performance but also by the form factor, comfort, and stability on the body. We collected direct feedback and device placement-related issues experienced by a cohort of people with epilepsy (PWE) to investigate to what extent available devices are nonintrusive, comfortable, and stable on the body. Methods: Four models of wearable devices (E4 wrist band, Everion upper arm band, IMEC upper arm band, and Epilog scalp patch electrodes) were worn by PWE who were admitted to two epilepsy monitoring units (EMUs) in London and Freiburg. Participants were periodically reviewed, and accidental displacements of the devices were annotated. Participants' experience was assessed using the Technology Acceptance Model Fast Form (TAM-FF) plus two additional questions on comfort. A thematic analysis was also performed on the free text of the questionnaire. Results: One hundred and fifteen participants were enrolled. The devices had a good stability on the body including during seizures. Overall, all the devices were considered comfortable to be worn, including during sleep. However, devices containing wires and patches demonstrated a lesser degree of stability on the body and were judged less positively. Participants age was correlated with TAM-FF mean scores, and older participants judged the devices less favorably compared with younger participants. Discussion: Removable but securely fitted, wireless, and comfortable designs were considered more appropriate for a continuous monitoring aimed at seizure detection. Some caution may be required when patch electrodes and electrodes glued to the skin or to the scalp are used, as those evaluated in the present study demonstrated a lower level of acceptability and a lower degree of stability to the body, especially at night. These factors could limit a continuous monitoring decreasing the device performance for nocturnal, unsupervised seizures which are at higher risk of lethality. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Pervasive health technologies can increase the effectiveness of personal health monitoring and training, but more user studies are necessary to understand the interest for these technologies, and how they should be designed and implemented. In the present study, we evaluated eWALL, a user-centered pervasive health technology consisting of a platform that monitors users’ physical and cognitive behavior, providing feedback and motivation via an easy-to-use, touch-based user interface. The eWALL was placed for one month in the home of 48 subjects with a chronic condition (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease—COPD or mild cognitive impairment—MCI) or with an age-related impairment. User acceptance, platform use, and potential clinical effects were evaluated using surveys, data logs, and clinical scales. Although some features of the platform need to be improved before reaching technical maturity and making a difference in patients’ lives, the real-life evaluation of eWALL has shown how some features may influence patients’ intention to use this promising technology. Furthermore, this study made it clear how the free use of different health apps is modulated by the real needs of the patient and by their usefulness in the context of the patient’s clinical status. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - During the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, different technologies, including telehealth, are maximised to mitigate the risks and consequences of the disease. Telehealth has been widely utilised because of its usability and safety in providing healthcare services during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, a systematic literature review which provides extensive evidence on the impact of COVID-19 through telehealth and which covers multiple directions in a large-scale research remains lacking. This study aims to review telehealth literature comprehensively since the pandemic started. It also aims to map the research landscape into a coherent taxonomy and characterise this emerging field in terms of motivations, open challenges and recommendations. Articles related to telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic were systematically searched in the WOS, IEEE, Science Direct, Springer and Scopus databases. The final set included (n = 86) articles discussing telehealth applications with respect to (i) control (n = 25), (ii) technology (n = 14) and (iii) medical procedure (n = 47). Since the beginning of the pandemic, telehealth has been presented in diverse cases. However, it still warrants further attention. Regardless of category, the articles focused on the challenges which hinder the maximisation of telehealth in such times and how to address them. With the rapid increase in the utilization of telehealth in different specialised hospitals and clinics, a potential framework which reflects the authors’ implications of the future application and opportunities of telehealth has been established. This article improves our understanding and reveals the full potential of telehealth during these difficult times and beyond. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Over the last couple of years, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, many healthcare issues have been exacerbated, highlighting the paramount need to provide both reliable and affordable health services to remote locations by using the latest technologies such as video conferencing, data management, the secure transfer of patient information, and efficient data analysis tools such as machine learning algorithms. In the constant struggle to offer healthcare to everyone, many modern technologies find applicability in eHealth, mHealth, telehealth or telemedicine. Through this paper, we attempt to render an overview of what different technologies are used in certain healthcare applications, ranging from remote patient monitoring in the field of cardio-oncology to analyzing EEG signals through machine learning for the prediction of seizures, focusing on the role of artificial intelligence in eHealth. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Chronic lung disorders like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) are characterized by exacerbations. They are unpleasant for patients and sometimes severe enough to cause hospital admission and death. Moreover, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, vulnerable populations with these disorders are at high risk, and their routine care cannot be done properly. Remote monitoring offers a low cost and safe solution for gaining visibility into the health of people in their daily lives, making it useful for vulnerable populations. Objective: The primary objective is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of remote monitoring using wearables and mobile phones in patients with pulmonary diseases. The secondary objective is to provide power calculations for future studies centered around understanding the number of exacerbations according to sample size and duration. Methods: Twenty participants will be recruited in each of three cohorts (COPD, IPF, and posthospitalization COVID). Data collection will be done remotely using the RADAR-Base (Remote Assessment of Disease And Relapse) mobile health (mHealth) platform for different devices, including Garmin wearable devices and smart spirometers, mobile app questionnaires, surveys, and finger pulse oximeters. Passive data include wearable-derived continuous heart rate, oxygen saturation, respiration rate, activity, and sleep. Active data include disease-specific patient-reported outcome measures, mental health questionnaires, and symptom tracking to track disease trajectory. Analyses will assess the feasibility of lung disorder remote monitoring (including data quality, data completeness, system usability, and system acceptability). We will attempt to explore disease trajectory, patient stratification, and identification of acute clinical events such as exacerbations. A key aspect is understanding the potential of real-time data collection. We will simulate an intervention to acquire responses at the time of the event to assess model performance for exacerbation identification. Results: The Remote Assessment of Lung Disease and Impact on Physical and Mental Health (RALPMH) study provides a unique opportunity to assess the use of remote monitoring in the evaluation of lung disorders. The study started in the middle of June 2021. The data collection apparatus, questionnaires, and wearable integrations were setup and tested by the clinical teams prior to the start of recruitment. While recruitment is ongoing, real-time exacerbation identification models are currently being constructed. The models will be pretrained daily on data of previous days, but the inference will be run in real time. Conclusions: The RALPMH study will provide a reference infrastructure for remote monitoring of lung diseases. It specifically involves information regarding the feasibility and acceptability of remote monitoring and the potential of real-time data collection and analysis in the context of chronic lung disorders. It will help plan and inform decisions in future studies in the area of respiratory health. © 2021 Fundacion Instituto de Historia Social. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Digital health care is an important strategy in the war against COVID-19. South Korea introduced living and treatment support centers (LTSCs) to control regional outbreaks and care for patients with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19. Seoul National University Hospital (SNUH) introduced information and communications technology (ICT)-based solutions to manage clinically healthy patients with COVID-19. Objective: This study aims to investigate satisfaction and usability by patients and health professionals in the optimal use of a mobile app and wearable device that SNUH introduced to the LTSC for clinically healthy patients with COVID-19. Methods: Online surveys and focus group interviews were conducted to collect quantitative and qualitative data. Results: Regarding usability testing of the wearable device, perceived usefulness had the highest mean score of 4.45 (SD 0.57) points out of 5. Regarding usability of the mobile app, perceived usefulness had the highest mean score of 4.62 (SD 0.48) points out of 5. Regarding satisfaction items for the mobile app among medical professionals, the "self-reporting"item had the highest mean score of 4.42 (SD 0.58) points out of 5. In focus group interviews of health care professionals, hospital information system interfacing was the most important functional requirement for ICT-based COVID-19 telemedicine. Conclusions: Improvement of patient safety and reduction of the burden on medical staff were the expected positive outcomes. Stability and reliability of the device, patient education, accountability, and reimbursement issues should be considered as part of the development of remote patient monitoring. In responding to a novel contagious disease, telemedicine and a wearable device were shown to be useful during a global crisis. © 2021 Ye Seul Bae, Kyung Hwan Kim, Sae Won Choi, Taehoon Ko, Jun Seo Lim, Meihua Piao.

AB  - Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with a fast increasing prevalence. Several pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions are available to alleviate symptoms. Technology can be used to improve the efficiency, accessibility and feasibility of these treatments. Although many technologies are available, only few are actually implemented in daily clinical practice. Aim: Here, we study the barriers and facilitators, as experienced by patients, caregivers and/or healthcare providers, to successful implement technology for PD management. Methods: We performed a systematic literature search in the PubMed and Embase databases until June 2022. Two independent raters screened the titles, abstracts and full texts on: 1) people with PD; 2) using technology for disease management; 3) qualitative research methods providing patients’, caregivers and/or healthcare providers’ perspective, and; 4) full text available in English or Dutch. Case studies, reviews and conference abstracts were excluded. Results: We found 5420 unique articles of which 34 were included in this study. Five categories were made: cueing (n = 3), exergaming (n = 3), remote monitoring using wearable sensors (n = 10), telerehabilitation (n = 8) and remote consultation (n = 10). The main barriers reported across categories were unfamiliarity with technology, high costs, technical issues and (motor) symptoms hampering the use of some technologies. Facilitators included good usability, experiencing beneficial effects and feeling safe whilst using the technology. Conclusion: Although only few articles presented a qualitative evaluation of technologies, we found some important barriers and facilitators that may help to bridge the gap between the fast developing technological world and actual implementation in day-to-day living with PD. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - Background: Management of patients with multiple chronic diseases is a growing public health challenge, especially in rural sectors where access to physicians may be limited. Connected medical devices monitoring vital signs, associated with eHealth program and structured telephone support, may improve complex patient management through early detection of disease complications, positive impact on patients' health, and health resources consumption optimization. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the technical performance and user experience of the NOMHAD eHealth system in patients with multimorbidity. Methods: This was a pilot, single-arm, interventional study. Patients with multimorbidity with any combination of chronic heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes were followed for 80-100 days using the NOMHAD eHealth system. This system used connected devices telemonitoring symptoms and vital signs (eg, body weight, oxygen saturation, pulse rate, blood pressure, and blood glucose), associated with structured telecoaching and educational support by call center nurses. An overall risk indicator (ORI) was automatically computed after each data teletransmission. The ORI was color coded; green indicated no action required; yellow, orange, and red (low to high priority, respectively) generated telenotifications and indicated to the nurses the need for a telecoaching action. Each ORI was calculated by combining 7 clinical stability system indicators based on symptom questionnaires and vital signs. Technical accuracy of the system was assessed by comparing system-generated ORIs with ORIs recalculated from raw data. Ease of use, usefulness, satisfaction, and acceptability of the system were assessed through patient adherence to self-assessments, and through self-administered questionnaires to patients, call center nurses, and physicians. Results: A total of 23 patients were enrolled in this study and participated between April 2016 and March 2017 at 5 study centers in France. All patients were successfully equipped and evaluable for analysis. Mean age was 68.5 (SD 10.4) years and most patients were men (n=20). The most common multimorbidity was CHF + diabetes (n=15), followed by patients with all 3 diseases (n=5). Mean effective follow-up was 78.7 (SD 24.2) days. The system generated 6263 ORIs, as several ORIs could be generated on a single day for any patient. Overall system sensitivity was 99.2% (95% CI 98.9-99.4) and overall specificity was 91.3% (95% CI 87.7-94.1). Most patients (20/23, 87%) were satisfied with the system and agreed that it helped them to better understand and manage their diseases, and 19/23 (83%) valued the nurse regular contacts. Nurses and physicians were generally satisfied with the system and considered it useful. All users indicated they would agree to long-term use of the system. Conclusions: This study provides evidence that the NOMHAD eHealth system is accurate, acceptable, informative, and feasible for patients with multimorbidity, supporting further investigation of its clinical benefits. © 2022 JMIR Publications Inc..

AB  - Technological advancements have facilitated the development of innovative wearable electrocardiography (ECG) patches suitable for remote patient monitoring. However, there is a current lack of comprehensive understanding regarding the user experience (UX) associated with these devices which is crucial to ensure their widespread acceptance. This research aims to present a design for a wireless ECG patch (WEP) that focuses on user experience features, making it easy to operate and integrate into daily routines. Initially, we surveyed 50 participants to discern the pertinent criteria for the user experience (UX) design of commercial ECG patches. Our approach integrated existing research findings and incorporated technical considerations mandated by project stakeholders. Subsequently, an expert panel comprising a designer, technical experts, and a physician selected the optimal design concept. Following the development of the prototype, it underwent a 48-hour user experience investigation, which involved a questionnaire and an overview assessment. A significant majority of participants reported that the device was comfortable to wear and easy to use. Additionally, the study participants expressed satisfaction and indicated a keen interest in utilizing the device in the future. These results affirm that the newly designed WEP is a reliable, comfortable, and user-friendly device for remote patient monitoring, hinting at the potential for such devices to enhance patient care and improve overall health outcomes through further development and adoption.  © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Background: The recent growth of eHealth is unprecedented, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic. Within eHealth, wearable technology is increasingly being adopted because it can offer the remote monitoring of chronic and acute conditions in daily life environments. Wearable technology may be used to monitor and track key indicators of physical and psychological stress in daily life settings, providing helpful information for clinicians. One of the key challenges is to present extensive wearable data to clinicians in an easily interpretable manner to make informed decisions. Objective: The purpose of this research was to design a wearable data dashboard, named CarePortal, to present analytic visualizations of wearable data that are meaningful to clinicians. The study was divided into 2 main research objectives: to understand the needs of clinicians regarding wearable data interpretation and visualization and to develop a system architecture for a web application to visualize wearable data and related analytics. Methods: We used a wearable data set collected from 116 adolescent participants who experienced trauma. For 2 weeks, participants wore a Microsoft Band that logged physiological sensor data such as heart rate (HR). A total of 834 days of HR data were collected. To design the CarePortal dashboard, we used a participatory design approach that interacted directly with clinicians (stakeholders) with backgrounds in clinical psychology and neuropsychology. A total of 8 clinicians were recruited from the Rhode Island Hospital and the University of Massachusetts Memorial Health. The study involved 5 stages of participatory workshops and began with an understanding of the needs of clinicians. A User Experience Questionnaire was used at the end of the study to quantitatively evaluate user experience. Physiological metrics such as daily and hourly maximum, minimum, average, and SD of HR and HR variability, along with HR-based activity levels, were identified. This study investigated various data visualization graphing methods for wearable data, including radar charts, stacked bar plots, scatter plots combined with line plots, simple bar plots, and box plots. Results: We created a CarePortal dashboard after understanding the clinicians’ needs. Results from our workshops indicate that overall clinicians preferred aggregate information such as daily HR instead of continuous HR and want to see trends in wearable sensor data over a period (eg, days). In the User Experience Questionnaire, a score of 1.4 was received, which indicated that CarePortal was exciting to use (question 5), and a similar score was received, indicating that CarePortal was the leading edge (question 8). On average, clinicians reported that CarePortal was supportive and can be useful in making informed decisions. Conclusions: We concluded that the CarePortal dashboard integrated with wearable sensor data visualization techniques would be an acceptable tool for clinicians to use in the future. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Physiotherapy for persons with Parkinson's disease (PwPD) could benefit from objective and continuous tracking of physical activity and falls in daily life. Objectives: We designed a remote monitoring system for this purpose and describe the experiences of PwPD and physiotherapists who used the system in daily clinical practice. Methods: Twenty-one PwPD (15 men) wore a sensor necklace to passively record physical activity and falls for 6 weeks. They also used a smartphone app to self-report daily activities, (near-)falls and medication intake. They discussed those data with their PD-specialized physiotherapist (n = 9) during three regular treatment sessions. User experiences and aspects to be improved were gathered through interviews with PwPD and physiotherapists, resulting in system updates. The system was evaluated in a second pilot with 25 new PwPD (17 men) and eight physiotherapists. Results: We applied thematic analysis to the interview data resulting in two main themes: usability and utility. First, the usability of the system was rated positively, with the necklace being easy to use. However, some PwPD with limited digital literacy or cognitive impairments found the app unclear. Second, the perceived utility of the system varied among PwPD. While many PwPD were motivated to increase their activity level, others were not additionally motivated because they perceived their activity level as high. Physiotherapists appreciated the objective recording of physical activity at home and used the monitoring of falls to enlarge awareness of the importance of falls for PwPD. Based on the interview data of all participants, we drafted three user profiles for PwPD regarding the benefits of remote monitoring for physiotherapy: for profile 1, a monitoring system could act as a flagging dashboard to signal the need for renewed treatment; for profile 2, a monitoring system could be a motivational tool to maintain physical activity; for profile 3, a monitoring system could passively track physical activity and falls at home. Finally, for a subgroup of PwPD the burdens of monitoring will outweigh the benefits. Conclusions: Overall, both PwPD and physiotherapists underline the potential of a remote monitoring system to support physiotherapy by targeting physical activity and (near-)falls. Our findings emphasize the importance of personalization in remote monitoring technology, as illustrated by our user profiles.

AB  - Objectives: Gout flares are painful and disabling. We developed a smartphone application (app) for patients to tele-monitor gout flares surveyed by clinicians. The aim of this study was to assess patient acceptability and technical and clinical feasibility. Methods: Adult patients with either established gout or high suspicion thereof were recruited if they possessed a smartphone and reported a recent arthritis attack. A smartphone application was used to identify gout flares by asking during 90 consecutive days: (1) what is your pain score (0-10); (2) are your joints warm; (3) are your joints swollen; and (4) are you currently experiencing a gout flare? The clinician was alerted via email if a flare occurred. Patient acceptability was assessed using the technology acceptance model. Technical feasibility consisted of reported technical issues and clinical feasibility of actions taken by the clinician regarding gout flare alerts. Results: Twenty-nine included patients completed the study. The mean age of participants was 57 years, and all but one were male. The adherence rate was 96% (110 of 2910 queries were missed). Patients had a positive attitude toward app use, found the app very easy to use (mean usability score 81 out of 100) and were neutral to positive on its usefulness. There were four minor technical issues. A total of 100 gout flare alerts were generated that led to 18 proactive contacts with patients. Conclusion: A smartphone app to monitor gout flares was developed and tested, showing high adherence, good acceptability and clinical feasibility for established gout patients.

AB  - Digital transformation of healthcare is indeed a foundation stone toward a patientfocused system of healthcare. It can allow healthcare professionals to drive efficiency, consider whatever the patient needs, develop confidence and trust, and have enhanced user experience. Enhance the efficiency of treatment and access to medical care while reducing costs as demographics age and increase, rising life expectancy and placing public spending on healthcare on demand are some of the key issues facing healthcare institutions around the globe. Basically, all members in the vast and growing healthcare sector are substantially growing their digitization and technical advancement activities in order to address those and other challenges, but they also provide demand for growth in healthcare and substantial money in digital wellbeing. Healthcare organizations are distinctive across the world and healthcare societies are starting to move at various responsibilities, based on the locality, the legal arrangement, the policy process, the personal institution, the involvement of the health industry and the specific objectives of digitalization in each individual’s life: such as improving patient centeredness in hospitals and increasing productivity to new forms of care, e.g., remote patient monitoring by utilizing fog, cloud technology, and the digital economy. Through elite elders to patients, wearable sensors have become particularly involved in monitoring physiological causes, encouraging fitness, and optimizing commitment to the procedure. In this chapter, fog computing-based wearable sensor networks (FWSNs) have been suggested in healthcare monitoring for elderly people using IoT. During regular activity, a wearable tracker for continuous - time tracking of blood pressure, breathing frequency, and motion was investigated. Furthermore, the sensor data will be transmitted to the IoT system Ethernet device, and the Approved Person uses the data to monitor the elder’s health through the Internet. Furthermore, the simulation tool for the wearable interface and its utilization show how computational resource costs can be lowered while retaining health demands for access to medical stored data in a cloud and fog distribution environment. The findings of the tests demonstrate that the proposed approach is user-friendly, dependable, and cost-effective to use it on a daily basis. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2022.

AB  - Background: Perioperative telemonitoring of patients undergoing major surgery might lead to improved postoperative outcomes. The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the effectiveness of current perioperative telemonitoring interventions on postoperative clinical, patient-reported, and financial outcome measures in patients undergoing major surgery. Methods: For this systematic review, PubMed, CINAHL, and Embase databases were searched for eligible articles published between January 1, 2009 and March 15, 2021. Studies were eligible as they described: (P) patients aged 18 years or older who underwent major abdominal surgery, (I) perioperative telemonitoring as intervention, (C) a control group receiving usual care, (O) any type of postoperative clinical, patient-reported, or financial outcome measures, and (S) an interventional study design. Results: The search identified 2958 articles of which 10 were eligible for analysis, describing nine controlled trials of 2438 patients. Perioperative telemonitoring comprised wearable biosensors (n = 3), websites (n = 3), e-mail (n = 1), and mobile applications (n = 2). Outcome measures were clinical (n = 8), patient-reported (n = 5), and financial (n = 2). Results show significant improvement of recovery time, stoma self-efficacy and pain in the early postoperative phase in patients receiving telemonitoring. Other outcome measures were not significantly different between the groups. Conclusion: Evidence for the effectiveness of perioperative telemonitoring in major surgery is scarce. There is a need for good quality studies with sufficient patients while ensuring that the quality and usability of the technology and the adoption in care processes are optimal. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Pain and stiffness in the musculoskeletal system cause limited range of motion and loss of mobility. Remediation includes home care programs, physical therapy, medication, and if necessary, surgery. Much of the recovery occurs at home. Active engagement by patients in their care program is crucial for successful clinical recovery. Recovering from a partial or total joint replacement requires active participation in an exercise program to help minimize swelling and improve motion and strength. On the other hand, non-surgical musculoskeletal indications, also require a personalized exercise plan for recovery. Patients need support with following their care at home. Remote care programs and monitoring offer convenient, safe, and time and cost-efficient care, including at-home physical therapy programs, and have broad clinical scope. We studied one such program. This paper reports the results of a platform that digitizes care programs for all musculoskeletal conditions, engages patients at their convenience, while providing visibility to recovery progress via patient-reported and sensor-generated data. We introduce Plethy Recupe which is a comprehensive platform for musculoskeletal care with a joint motion sensor, intuitive app, and intelligent clinical dashboard. Six exercises were selected from this platform and 10 individuals were asked to perform the exercises to evaluate the accuracy of the range of motion (ROM) and complete a questionnaire on the usability of the solution. © 2022, Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

AB  - Background: Smartphones are often equipped with inertial sensors that measure individuals' physical activity (PA). However, their role in remote monitoring of the patients' PAs in telemedicine needs to be adequately explored. Objective: This study aimed to explore the correlation between a participant's actual daily step counts and the daily step counts reported by their smartphone. In addition, we inquired about the usability of smartphones for collecting PA data. Methods: This prospective observational study was conducted among patients undergoing lower limb orthopedic surgery and a group of nonpatients as control. The data from the patients were collected from 2 weeks before surgery until 4 weeks after the surgery, whereas the data collection period for the nonpatients was 2 weeks. The participant's daily step count was recorded by PA trackers worn 24/7. In addition, a smartphone app collected the number of daily steps registered by the participants' smartphones. We compared the cross-correlation between the daily steps time series obtained from the smartphones and PA trackers in different groups of participants. We also used mixed modeling to estimate the total number of steps, using smartphone step counts and the characteristics of the patients as independent variables. The System Usability Scale was used to evaluate the participants' experience with the smartphone app and the PA tracker. Results: Overall, 1067 days of data were collected from 21 patients (n=11, 52% female patients) and 10 nonpatients (n=6, 60% female patients). The median cross-correlation coefficient on the same day was 0.70 (IQR 0.53-0.83). The correlation in the nonpatient group was slightly higher than that in the patient group (median 0.74, IQR 0.60-0.90 and median 0.69, IQR 0.52-0.81, respectively). The likelihood ratio tests on the models fitted by mixed effects methods demonstrated that the smartphone step count was positively correlated with the PA tracker's total number of steps (2 1=34.7, P<.001). In addition, the median usability score for the smartphone app was 78 (IQR 73-88) compared with median 73 (IQR 68-80) for the PA tracker. Conclusions: Considering the ubiquity, convenience, and practicality of smartphones, the high correlation between the smartphones and the total daily step count time series highlights the potential usefulness of smartphones in detecting changes in the number of steps in remote monitoring of a patient's PA. © 2023 JMIR Publications.

AB  - Developing a sensor that can read out cross-talk free signals while determining various active physiological parameters is demanding in the field of point-of-care applications. While there are a few examples of non-flexible sensors available, the management of electronic waste generated from such sensors is critical. Most of such available sensors are rigid in form factor and hence limit their usability in healthcare monitoring due to their poor conformity to human skin. Combining these facets, studies on the development of a recyclable cross-talk free flexible sensor for monitoring human motions and active parameters are far and few. In this work, we report on the development of a recyclable flexible sensor that can provide accurate data for detecting small changes in strain as well as pressure. The developed sensor could decipher the signals individually responsible due to strain as well as pressure. Hence, it can deliver a cross-talk free output. Thermoplastic polyurethane and graphene were selected as the model system. The thermoplastic polyurethane/graphene sensor exhibited a tensile strain sensitivity of GF ≃ 3.375 for 0-100% strain and 10.551 for 100-150% strain and a pressure sensitivity of ∼−0.25 kPa-1. We demonstrate the applicability of the strain sensor for monitoring a variety of human motions ranging from a very small strain of eye blinking to a large strain of elbow bending with unambiguous peaks and a very fast response and recovery time of 165 ms. The signals received are mostly electrical hysteresis free. To confirm the recyclability, the developed sensor was recycled up to three times. Marginal decrement in the sensitivity was noted with recycling without compromising the sensing capabilities. These findings promise to open up a new avenue for developing flexible sensors with lesser carbon footprints. © 2023 American Chemical Society

AB  - Background: Wearable devices have been used extensively both inside and outside of the hospital setting. During the COVID-19 pandemic, in some contexts, there was an increased need to remotely monitor pulse and saturated oxygen for patients due to the lack of staff and bedside monitors. Objective: A prototype of a remote monitoring system using wearable pulse oximeter devices was implemented at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, from August to December 2021. The aim of this work was to support the ongoing implementation of the remote monitoring system. Methods: We used an action learning approach with rapid pragmatic methods, including informal discussions and observations as well as a feedback survey form designed based on the technology acceptance model to assess the use and acceptability of the system. Based on these results, we facilitated a meeting using user-centered design principles to explore user needs and ideas about its development in more detail. Results: In total, 21 users filled in the feedback form. The mean technology acceptance model scores ranged from 3.5 (for perceived ease of use) to 4.4 (for attitude) with behavioral intention (3.8) and perceived usefulness (4.2) scoring in between. Those working as nurses scored higher on perceived usefulness, attitude, and behavioral intention than did physicians. Based on informal discussions, we realized there was a mismatch between how we (ie, the research team) and the ward teams perceived the use and wider purpose of the technology. Conclusions: Designing and implementing the devices to be more nurse-centric from their introduction could have helped to increase their efficiency and use during the complex pandemic period. © An Phuoc Luu, Truong Thanh Nguyen, Van Thi Cam Cao, Trinh Hoang Diem Ha, Lien Thi Thu Chung, Trung Ngoc Truong, Tung Nguyen Le Nhu, Khoa Bach Dao, Hao Van Nguyen, Phan Nguyen Quoc Khanh, Khanh Thuy Thuy Le, Luu Hoai Bao Tran, Phung Tran Huy Nhat, Duc Minh Tran, Yen Minh Lam, Catherine Louise Thwaites, Jacob Mcknight, Nguyen Van Vinh Chau, Jennifer Ilo Van Nuil, Vietnam ICU Translational Applications Laboratory (VITAL).

AB  - The adoption of telehealth has soared, and with that the acceptance of Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) and virtual care. A review of the literature illustrates, however, that poor device usability can impact the generated data when using Patient-Generated Health Data (PGHD) devices, such as wearables or home use medical devices, when used outside a health facility. The Pi-CON methodology is introduced to overcome these challenges and guide the definition of user-friendly and intuitive devices in the future. Pi-CON stands for passive, continuous, and non-contact, and describes the ability to acquire health data, such as vital signs, continuously and passively with limited user interaction and without attaching any sensors to the patient. The paper highlights the advantages of Pi-CON by leveraging various sensors and techniques, such as radar, remote photoplethysmography, and infrared. It illustrates potential concerns and discusses future applications Pi-CON could be used for, including gait and fall monitoring by installing an omnipresent sensor based on the Pi-CON methodology. This would allow automatic data collection once a person is recognized, and could be extended with an integrated gateway so multiple cameras could be installed to enable data feeds to a cloud-based interface, allowing clinicians and family members to monitor patient health status remotely at any time. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - We reviewed the state of the art of smart wearable systems (SWS) that employ data science techniques to continuously monitor the health status of venous and diabetic foot ulcers (DFU). Our main objective was to analyze the literature to identify data collection and data science methods currently employed, as well as key research challenges that need to be addressed regarding the development of SWS applied to these selected vascular diseases. A narrative review was conducted, analyzing publications retrieved from PubMed and SCOPUS. Publications were first screened based on whether they describe a SWS applicable to the two selected vascular diseases, and must necessarily include data processing (descriptive, predictive and/or prescriptive analytics), either at planning or at the implementation stage. A total of 44 publications were included in the full-text analysis after screening. Our results were structured and presented according to three main topics consisting of data collection, smart features, and limitations and challenges. Overall, research on SWS for the targeted diseases are already robust and well defined in terms of what parameters should be measured, sensory devices and algorithms/clinical rules for recommendation level functionalities. Nevertheless, these projects lack evaluation on usability, adherence, satisfaction, as well as clinical validation, as works are mostly at proof-of-concept stage, focusing on pilots/small-scale preliminary studies to assess the developed systems. Therefore, and according to future work perspectives, authors should focus on the refinement of current systems and further evaluation and clinical validation of existing projects. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Remote monitoring of a fall condition or activities and daily life (ADL) of elderly patients has become one of the essential purposes for modern telemedicine. Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, including machine and deep learning models, have been recently applied in the medical field to automate the diagnosis procedures of abnormal and diseased cases. They also have many other applications, including the real-time identification of fall accidents in elderly patients. The goal of this article is to review recent research whose focus is to develop AI algorithms and methods of fall detection systems (FDS) in the IoT environment. In addition, the usability of different sensor types, such as gyroscopes and accelerometers in smartwatches, is described and discussed with the current limitations and challenges for realizing successful FDSs. The availability problem of public fall datasets for evaluating the proposed detection algorithms are also addressed in this study. Finally, this article is concluded by proposing advanced techniques such as lightweight deep models as one of the solutions and prospects of futuristic smart IoT-enabled systems for accurate fall detection in the elderly. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - An extended-reality (XR) platform for real-time monitoring of patients’ health during surgical procedures is proposed. The proposed system provides real-time access to a comprehensive set of patients’ information, which are made promptly available to the surgical team in the operating room (OR). In particular, the XR platform supports the medical staff by automatically acquiring the patient’s vitals from the operating room instrumentation and displaying them in real-time directly on an XR headset. Furthermore, information regarding the patient clinical record is also shown upon request. Finally, the XR-based monitoring platform also allows displaying in XR the video stream coming directly from the endoscope. The innovative aspect of the proposed XR-based monitoring platform lies in the comprehensiveness of the available information, in its modularity and flexibility (in terms of adaption to different sources of data), ease of use, and most importantly, in a reliable communication, which are critical requirements for the healthcare field. To validate the proposed system, experimental tests were conducted using instrumentation typically available in the operating room (i.e., a respiratory ventilator, a patient monitor for intensive care, and an endoscope). The overall results showed (i) an accuracy of the data communication greater than 99 %, along with (ii) an average time response below ms, and (iii) satisfying feedback from the SUS questionnaires filled out by the physicians after intensive use. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Pediatric and adolescent athletes are a large demographic undergoing anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACL-R). Postoperative rehabilitation is critical, requiring patients to complete home exercise programs (HEPs). To address obstacles to HEP adherence, we developed an interactive health technology, interACTION (iA), to monitor knee-specific rehabilitation. iA is a web-based platform that incorporates wearable motion sensors and a mobile app that provides feedback and allows remote monitoring. The Wheel of Sukr is a gamification mechanism that includes numerous behavioral elements. Objective: This study aims to use a user-centered design process to incorporate behavioral change strategies derived from self-management theory into iA using the Wheel of Sukr, with the aim of influencing patient behavior. Methods: In total, 10 athletes aged 10-18 years with a history of ACL-R were included in this study. Patients were between 4 weeks and 1 year post–ACL-R. Participants underwent a 60-minute triphasic interview. Phase 1 focused on elements of gaming that led to high participation and information regarding surgery and recovery. In phase 2, participants were asked to think aloud and rank cards representing the components of the Wheel of Sukr in order of interest. In phase 3, the patients reviewed the current version of iA. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and checked for accuracy. Qualitative content analysis segmented the data and tagged meaningful codes until descriptive redundancy was achieved; next, 2 coders independently coded the data set. These elements were categorized according to the Wheel of Sukr framework. The mean age of participants was 12.8 (SD 1.32) years, and 70% (7/10) were female. Most participants (7/10, 70%) reported attending sessions twice weekly. All patients were prescribed home exercises. Self-reported HEP compliance was 75%-100% in 40% (4/10), 50%-75% in 40% (4/10), and 25%-50% of prescribed exercises in 20% (2/10) of the participants. Results: The participants responded positively to an app that could track home exercises. Desirable features included exercise demonstrations, motivational components, and convenience. The participants listed sports specificity, competition, notifications, reminders, rewards, and social aspects of gameplay as features to incorporate. In the Wheel of Sukr card sort exercise, motivation was ranked first; self-management, second; and growth, esteem, and fun tied for the third position. The recommended gameplay components closely followed the themes from the Wheel of Sukr card sort activity. Conclusions: The participants believe iA is a helpful addition to recovery and want the app to include exercise movement tracking and encouragement. Despite the small number of participants, thematic saturation was reached, suggesting the sample was sufficient to obtain a representative range of perspectives. Future work will implement motivation; self-management; and growth, confidence, and fun in the iA user experience. Young athlete ACL-R patients will complete typical clinical scenarios using increasingly developed prototypes of the gamified iA in a controlled setting. ©Michael McClincy, Liliana G Seabol, Michelle Riffitts, Ethan Ruh, Natalie E Novak, Rachel Wasilko, Megan E Hamm, Kevin M Bell.

AB  - Background: Patients with cancer undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy face an elevated risk of developing serious infection as a consequence of their treatment, which lowers their white blood cell count and, more specifically, their absolute neutrophil count. This condition is known as neutropenia. Neutropenia accompanied by a fever is referred to as febrile neutropenia, a common side effect of chemotherapy with a high mortality rate. The timely detection of severe neutropenia (<500 absolute neutrophil count/μL) is critical in detecting and managing febrile neutropenia. Current methods rely on blood draws, which limit them to clinical settings and do not allow frequent or portable monitoring. In this study, we demonstrated the usability of PointCheck, a noninvasive device for neutropenia screening, in a simulated home environment without clinical supervision. PointCheck automatically performs microscopy through the skin of the finger to image the blood flowing through superficial microcapillaries and enables the remote monitoring of neutropenia status, without requiring venipuncture. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the usability of PointCheck, a noninvasive optical technology for screening severe neutropenia, with the goal of identifying potential user interface, functionality, and design issues from the perspective of untrained users. Methods: We conducted a multicenter study using quantitative and qualitative approaches to evaluate the usability of PointCheck across 154 untrained participants. We used a mixed method approach to gather usability data through user testing observations, a short-answer qualitative questionnaire, and a standardized quantitative System Usability Scale (SUS) survey to assess perceived usability and satisfaction. Results: Of the 154 participants, we found that 108 (70.1%) scored above 80.8 on the SUS across all sites, with a mean SUS score of 86.1 across all sites. Furthermore, the SUS results indicated that, out of the 151 users who completed the SUS survey, 145 (96%) found that they learned how to use PointCheck very quickly, and 141 (93.4%) felt very confident when using the device. Conclusions: We have shown that PointCheck, a novel technology for noninvasive, home-based neutropenia detection, can be safely and effectively operated by first-time users. In a simulated home environment, these users found it easy to use, with a mean SUS score of 86.1, indicating an excellent perception of usability and placing this device within the top tenth percentile of systems evaluated for usability by the SUS. © 2022 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

AB  - Continuous healthcare monitoring is a prevalent need for the spinal cord injured (SCI) population to mitigate the risk of secondary health conditions and develop preventive methods. In this paper, we developed an embodied system for remote monitoring and classification of activities of daily living (ADL). We propose a framework for sensor transfer learning to recognize these activities from simple and short samples through label transferring from a deep SlowFast network on video data. Multiple wearable devices were included and synchronized in this study to capture physiological data as well as posture and movement from acceleration and pressure distribution. Furthermore, we propose a pipeline of data capturing for automatically creating a ground truth dataset of different ADLs. Results from a pilot training with eight users in 15 minutes task recordings over eight different tasks produced a weighted accuracy on F1-score of 77% in correctly classifying ADLs. Although extending the data is required to increase precision, we showed a successful method for monitoring and classification of specific activities in SCI with up to 91% in accuracy. Further work will focus on extending to multi-class soft labelling for achieving usability in complex situations. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Wearable sensing electronics capable of detecting and differentiating multiple mechanical stimuli are promising devices in the applications of healthcare monitoring, robotics, etc. However, most wearable sensors are developed for detecting only uniaxial mechanical stimuli, which severely hinders their practical applications that usually involve complex mechanical stimuli. Here, a wing-like multifunctional sensor (WMS) consisting of pressure sensing module in the middle and stretching sensing module in both wings is developed with the capability of detecting and differentiating pressure, stretching, convex and concave bending through distinct electrical signals variation trends. The hierarchical in-situ filling porous as pressure sensing layer and micro-wrinkled carbon nanotubes (CNTs)/Ag nanoflakes as stretch sensing layer achieve high sensitivity over a broad range in both pressure (sensitivity of 0.25 kPa−1 at 500 kPa) and strain sensing (Gauge factor of 140 at 150%). The pressure and stretch sensing module can work without interfering with each other, which is realized by structural design of lower Young's modulus stretch sensing module and higher thickness and compressibility pressure sensing module. Then WMS is demonstrated in accurate detection of human kinesthesia, human-computer interface, identification of objects of various hardnesses and sizes by robotic gripper, and perception of environmental information through a crawling robot. © 2023

AB  - In the latest years, the potentiality of a combined use of electrocardiography (ECG) and phonocardiography (PCG) for the assessment of the electromechanical coupling of the heart has gained interest within the scientific community. The availability of this technology in a home care context would enable the timely monitoring of patients where the electromechanical coupling is impaired, such as in heart failure. Nevertheless, the domiciliary use of electro-phonocardiography is at date prevented by the critical positioning of the electronic stethoscope, which cannot be reliably performed by inexperienced users. In this work, we propose a usability analysis of a multi-sensor array that we developed for this purpose. The multi-sensor array is a flexible pad embedding 3 electrodes and 48 microphones, distributed over the left hemithorax with a high spatial resolution. In our experimental protocol, we simulated a real home care scenario: volunteers with no technical nor clinical skills were enrolled in couples and alternatively performed the recordings on each other, simulating the roles of patient and caregiver. Results show that a Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) higher that 13 dB was always achieved, even before any digital filtering. Moreover, the influence of the body structure of the patient, quantified in terms of Body Mass Index and thoracic circumference, on the quality of the signals was assessed. A moderate significant negative correlation was found, as expected, but in the overall the body structure did not prevent from obtaining reliable signals even in cases of severe overweight. We believe that the presented findings lay the foundations for the use of electro-phonocardiography in telemonitoring applications. © 2023 Convegno Nazionale di Bioingegneria. All rights reserved.

AB  - The purposes of this pilot study are to utilize digital remote monitoring to (a) evaluate the usability and satisfaction of a wireless blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) monitor and (b) de-termine whether these data can enable safe mobilization at home after same‐day discharge (SDD) joint replacement. A population of 23 SDD patients undergoing unicompartmental knee arthro-plasty (UKA), total knee arthroplasty (TKA), or total hip arthroplasty (THA) were given a cellular BP/HR monitor, with real‐time data capture. Patients took three readings after surgery, observing for specific blood pressure decreases, HR increases, or hypotensive symptoms. If any criteria ap-plied, patients followed a hydration protocol and delayed ambulation. Home coaching was also provided to each patient. Patient experience was surveyed, and responses were assessed using de-scriptive statistics. Of 18 patients discharged (78%), 17 returned surveys, of which 100% reported successful device operation. The mean “ease of use” rating was 8.9/10; satisfaction with home coaching was 9.7/10; and belief that the protocol improved patient safety was 8.4/10. A total of 27.8% (n = 5) had hypotensive readings and appropriately delayed ambulation. Our pilot findings support the feasibility of and confirm the satisfaction with remote monitoring after SDD arthroplasty. All patients with symptoms of hypotension were successfully remotely managed using a standardized hydration protocol prior to safe mobilization. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Over recent years, interest in the development of smart health technologies aimed at supporting independent living for older populations has increased. The integration of innovative technologies, such as the Internet of Things, wearable technologies, artificial intelligence, and ambient-assisted living applications, represents a valuable solution for this scope. Designing such an integrated system requires addressing several aspects (eg, equipment selection, data management, analytics, costs, and users'needs) and involving different areas of expertise (eg, medical science, service design, biomedical and computer engineering). Objective: The objective of this study is 2-fold; we aimed to design the functionalities of a smart health platform addressing 5 chronic conditions prevalent in the older population (ie, hearing loss, cardiovascular diseases, cognitive impairments, mental health problems, and balance disorders) by considering both older adults'and clinicians' perspectives and to evaluate the identified smart health platform functionalities with a small group of older adults. Methods: Overall, 24 older adults (aged >65 years) and 118 clinicians were interviewed through focus group activities and web-based questionnaires to elicit the smart health platform requirements. Considering the elicited requirements, the main functionalities of smart health platform were designed. Then, a focus group involving 6 older adults was conducted to evaluate the proposed solution in terms of usefulness, credibility, desirability, and learnability. Results: Eight main functionalities were identified and assessed-cognitive training and hearing training (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 6/6, 100%; learnability: 6/6, 100%), monitoring of physiological parameters (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 6/6, 100%; learnability: 5/6, 83%), physical training (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 5/6, 83%; learnability: 2/6, 33%), psychoeducational intervention (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 4/6, 67%; learnability: 2/6, 33%), mood monitoring (usefulness: 4/6, 67%; credibility: 4/6, 67%; desirability: 3/6, 50%; learnability: 5/6, 50%), diet plan (usefulness: 5/6, 83%; credibility: 4/6, 67%; desirability: 1/6, 17%; learnability: 2/6, 33%), and environment monitoring and adjustment (usefulness: 1/6, 17%; credibility: 1/6, 17%; desirability: 0/6, 0%; learnability: 0/6, 0%). Most of them were highly appreciated by older participants, with the only exception being environment monitoring and adjustment. The results showed that the proposed functionalities met the needs and expectations of users (eg, improved self-management of patients' disease and enhanced patient safety). However, some aspects need to be addressed (eg, technical and privacy issues). Conclusions: The presented smart health platform functionalities seem to be able to meet older adults' needs and desires to enhance their self-awareness and self-management of their medical condition, encourage healthy and independent living, and provide evidence-based support for clinicians' decision-making. Further research with a larger and more heterogeneous pool of stakeholders in terms of demographics and clinical conditions is needed to assess system acceptability and overall user experience in free-living conditions. © 2022 JMIR Publications Inc..

AB  - Wearable sensor technology is the new and upcoming revolution in next-generation IoT solutions that will enable efficient and more reliable healthcare monitoring. The primary goal of wearable sensor technology is to collect and instantly transmit a patient's health-related data. For real-time health monitoring of critical patients, data of varying sizes must be transferred quickly, effectively, and in a prioritized manner. In this paper, we focus on prioritizing the data captured by various wearable devices, equipped by the patients. The data captured and generated in such cases will be heterogeneous in nature and transmitted at different rates. The prioritization is done on the MAC layer by varying the back-off time experienced by data of various priorities. We have given higher priority data lesser backoff time intervals compared to lower priority data, thus transferring it faster and reducing its latency. As wearable sensors have power, memory, and other resource constraints, Routing protocol for low power and lossy Network (RPL) is the best-suited routing protocol for such networks. The introduction of Mobility in this research incorporates the real-time movements of patients wearing the sensors, which simulates a more realistic scenario for this study.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Remote patient monitoring (RPM) is an innovative strategy to promote health and improve patient management and care. Recent advances in healthcare technologies have seen the emergence of wearable sensors allowing longitudinal physiological measurements in any environment. This paper introduces a wireless wearable patch 'Leo' for continuous remote monitoring of physiological data at home and healthcare settings. This includes single lead ECG, chest impedance, heart rate (HR), respiration rate (RR) and body posture. To test Leo's ability to capture longitudinal physiological data at home, 15 children experiencing acute severe asthma exacerbations were recruited during their emergency department (ED) visits. Participants wore the Leo device for 7 (+/-2) days post-hospital discharge. Nocturnal RR and HR and variability were higher during the first half of the night on Day1 compared to Day7 (p<0.005). Participants also completed a usability questionnaire and reported the patch wear to be comfortable (average score of 3.3 out of 5) and easy to wear during the night (average score of 3.5 out of 5) with 5/15 (33%) reported very slight barely perceptible skin irritation/redness and 2 (13%) reported well defined skin irritation and redness.Clinical Relevance - These results highlight the potential use of the Leo device in clinical practice for continuous un-obstructive monitoring of diseased populations, such as asthma. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Background: Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are a primary cause of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes worldwide. For women at risk of hypertensive complications, guidelines recommend frequent surveillance of blood pressure and signs of preeclampsia. Clinic visits range from every 2 weeks to several times a week. Given the wide ubiquity of smartphones and computers in most countries and a growing attention for self-management, digital technologies, including mobile health (mHealth), constitute a promising component of monitoring (self-measured) blood pressure during pregnancy. Currently, little is known about the experiences of women using such platforms and how mHealth can be aligned with their needs and preferences. Objective: The objectives were twofold: (1) to explore the experiences of Dutch women who had an increased risk of HDP with a blended care approach (mHealth combined with face-to-face care) for remote self-monitoring of blood pressure and preeclampsia symptoms and (2) to formulate recommendations for the use and integration of mHealth in clinical care. Methods: Alongside a prospective blended care study (SAFE@home study) that monitors pregnant women at increased risk of HPD with mHealth technology, a mixed methods study was conducted, including questionnaires (n=52) and interviews (n=11). Results were analyzed thematically. Results: Of the 4 themes, 2 themes were related to the technologies themselves (expectations, usability), and 2 themes were related to the interaction and use of mHealth (autonomy and responsibilities of patients, responsibilities of health care professionals). First, the digital platform met the expectations of patients, which contributed to user satisfaction. Second, the platform was considered user-friendly, and patients favored different moments and frequencies for measuring their blood pressure. Third, patient autonomy was mentioned in terms of increased insight about their own condition and being able to influence clinical decision making. Fourth, clinical expertise of health care professionals was considered essential to interpret the data, which translates to subsequent responsibilities for clinical management. Data from the questionnaires and interviews corresponded. Conclusions: Blended care using an mHealth tool to monitor blood pressure in pregnancy was positively evaluated by its users. Insights from participants led to 7 recommendations for designing and implementing similar interventions and to enhance future, morally sound use of digital technologies in clinical care. © Karin Rolanda Jongsma, Josephus F M van den Heuvel, Jasmijn Rake, Annelien L Bredenoord, Mireille N Bekker.

AB  - With the advent of current electronics technology and access to the Internet, it is now possible to obtain distant medical diagnostics and counseling at a distance. However, because of the size and cost of such medical equipment, third-world and developing countries continue to face barriers to primary medical consultation and testing. One such medical situation is the early assessment of patients’ cardiovascular well-being. An attempt has been made in this suggested framework to build and implement a low-cost ECG collection combined with a local storage server system capable of capturing and storing patient data locally. When the system is connected to the Internet, the server can send patients’ ECG data to a group of registered cardiologists for immediate assessment of a patient’s criticality and generate complete assessment reports of individuals by collecting tagged information from the cardiologists’ responses in addition to local storage. These comprehensive assessment reports can then be printed for the patient or electronically mailed to others who need to know. This system is portable, low-cost, and seamlessly implementable into the Android UI for better usability over uninterrupted Internet service. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2024.

AB  - Telehealth and remote patient monitoring (RPM), in particular, have been through a massive surge of adoption since 2020. This initiative has proven potential for the patient and the healthcare provider in areas such as reductions in the cost of care. While home-use medical devices or wearables have been shown to be beneficial, a literature review illustrates challenges with the data generated, driven by limited device usability. This could lead to inaccurate data when an exam is completed without clinical supervision, with the consequence that incorrect data lead to improper treatment. Upon further analysis of the existing literature, the RPM Usability Impact model is introduced. The goal is to guide researchers and device manufacturers to increase the usability of wearable and home-use medical devices in the future. The importance of this model is highlighted when the user-centered design process is integrated, which is needed to develop these types of devices to provide the proper user experience. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Malnutrition is a common and distressing condition among pancreatic cancer patients. Fewer than a quarter of pancreatic cancer patients receive medical nutrition therapy (MNT), important for improving nutritional status, weight maintenance, quality of life and survival. System, provider, and patient level barriers limit access to MNT. We propose to examine the feasibility of a 12-week multi-level, digital health intervention designed to expand MNT access among pancreatic cancer patients. Methods: Individuals with advanced pancreatic cancer starting chemotherapy (N = 80) will be 1:1 randomized to the intervention or usual care. The Support Through Remote Observation and Nutrition Guidance (STRONG) intervention includes system-level (e.g., routine malnutrition and screening), provider-level (e.g., dietitian training and web-based dashboard), and patient-level strategies (e.g., individualized nutrition plan, self-monitoring of dietary intake via Fitbit, ongoing goal monitoring and feedback). Individuals receiving usual care will be referred to dietitians based on their oncologists’ discretion. Study assessments will be completed at baseline, 4-, 8-, 12-, and 16-weeks. Results: Primary outcomes will be feasibility (e.g., recruitment, retention, assessment completion) and acceptability. We will collect additional implementation outcomes, such as intervention adherence, perceived usability, and feedback on intervention quality via an exit interview. We will collect preliminary data on outcomes that may be associated with the intervention including malnutrition, quality of life, treatment outcomes, and survival. Conclusion: This study will advance our knowledge on the feasibility of a digital health intervention to reduce malnutrition among individuals with advanced pancreatic cancer.

AB  - Introduction: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an increasingly prevalent chronic, autoimmune, and inflammatory central nervous system illness, whose common symptoms undermine the quality of life of patients and their families. Recent technical breakthroughs potentially offer continuous, reliable, sensitive, and objective remote monitoring solutions for healthcare. Wearables can be useful for evaluating falls, fatigue, sedentary behavior, exercise, and sleep quality in people with MS (PwMS). Objective: This scoping review of relevant literature explores studies investigating the perceptions of patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs) about the use of wearable technologies in the management of MS. Methods: The Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for scoping reviews was used. The search strategy was applied to the databases, MEDLINE via Ovid, Embase, APA PsycInfo, and CINAHL. Further searches were performed in IEEE, Scopus, and Web of Science. The review considered studies reporting quantitative or qualitative data on perceptions and experiences of PwMS and HCPs concerning wearables’ usability, satisfaction, barriers, and facilitators. Results: 10 studies were included in this review. Wearables’ usefulness and accessibility, ease of use, awareness, and motivational tool potential were patient-perceived facilitators of use. Barriers related to anxiety and frustration, complexity, and the design of wearables. Perceived usefulness and system requirements are identified as facilitators of using wearables by HCPs, while data security concerns and fears of increased workload and limited effectiveness in the care plan are identified as barriers to use wearables. Conclusions: This review contributes to our understanding of the benefits of wearable technologies in MS by exploring perceptions of both PwMS and HCPs. The scoping review provided a broad overview of facilitators and barriers to wearable use in MS. There is a need for further studies underlined with sound theoretical frameworks to provide a robust evidence-base for the optimal use of wearables to empower healthcare users and providers. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - The Network of Effective Treatment (IoMT) model is used in various clinical trials and other healthcare operations. It is based on a novel set of ultraprecise tiny sensing devices and communication infrastructures, which give unmatched data collecting and ongoing vital sign capabilities. To fully realize the technology’s promise, however, some progress is required. First and foremost, the edge-computing paradigm must be considered. A definite amount of manufacturing in the vicinity of the detector must be permitted to enhance versatility and usability, dependability, and the IoMT terminals’ availability. Second, newer, more techniques for efficient information analysis, such as those that are specially adapted intelligence and deep learning, must be used. IoMT node designers and programmers must overcome severe optimization issues to conduct moderately complicated computing operations on flexible and wearable computing with low-power consumption devices with restricted power and battery lives to achieve these aims. This work investigates the creation of an examination of intellectual data methods for computer systems with limited resources by dynamically controlling the vehicle’s hardware and software configuration and adapting it to the necessary operating mode at runtime. A low-power microcontroller and a neural network model is employed to categorize cardiac data to test this strategy. It is observed that adjusting the node architecture to the strain at execution can be reduced to 50% in power utilization using the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia set as a testbed. A quantized neural network could diagnose arrhythmia disorders with a 98 percent accuracy rate. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The rapid growth of smart wearables and body sensor networks is expected to increase over the years. The reducing cost of manufacturing, deployment and the small and unobtrusive nature of most of the wearables available have intensified the acceptability for deployment in areas such as medical devices for healthcare monitoring. This work explored the use of artificial intelligence to enhance authentication of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) through a design of a framework. The framework is designed using wearable and or with a mobile device for extracting bioelectrical signals and context awareness data. The framework uses bioelectrical signals for authentication while artificial intelligence is applied using the contextual data to enhance the patient data integrity. The framework applied different security levels to balance between usability and security on the bases of False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and False Rejection Rate (FRR). 30 people are used for the evaluation of the different security levels and the security level 1 achieved a result based on usability vs security obtaining FAR of 5.6% and FRR of 9% but when the FAR is at 0% the FRR stood at 29%. The Intelligent Authentication Framework for Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) will be of advantage in increasing the trust of data extracted for the purpose of user authentication by reducing the FRR percentage. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Purpose: wearable devices aimed at detecting seizures are rapidly emerging. Continuous collection and optimal data quality are paramount to guarantee the acquisition of clinically meaningful data. It is still unknown how successfully patients can self-manage new technologies and which factors have an impact on this. We assessed the performance of patients managing a wrist-worn device. Method: patients wearing a wrist-worn device received a single training session to perform 5 tasks: (1) fitting the device correctly; (2) switching the device on and off; (3) charging the device on a daily basis; (4) pairing the device with a phone or tablet; (5) seeking assistance. Participants were then reviewed every 24 h and, at the end of the study, a Wearable technology Self-management Score (WSS) was calculated according to their performance in the different tasks (0–12). The association between WSS, seizure capture, demographics and clinical characteristics was analysed. Results: Thirty patients were included. The mean WSS score was 9.4 ± 2.1 points. The task more often performed inaccurately was pairing the device with a phone or tablet, followed by performing charging procedures. A strong association was found between WSS and seizure capture (p = 0.019), with higher scores strongly associated with more seizures captured. A WSS of ≥9 was the minimum value of WSS that allowed the device to record all the seizures. Number of AEDs and illness-perception related factors (perceived disease timeline and personal control) were significantly associated with WSS. Conclusions: Overall, participants demonstrated good performances in self-managing a wrist-worn device. Digital inequalities may extend to variations in how different individuals feel about their own disease and, consequently, manage the technology. These aspects should be addressed when technological solutions are delivered to users. © 2020 British Epilepsy Association

AB  - Background: With the spread of COVID-19, telemedicine solutions became crucial to release continuous and remote assistance to chronic patients. The rapid transition to telemedicine solutions did not allow a complete assessment of the user experience by both patients and medical personnel. Despite the well-known benefits in remote care, the lack of usability evaluation of already existing technologies for the vital signs measurement has emerged. A telemedicine platform must match video communication between patients and the medical staff with the possibility to measure vital parameters. Furthermore, technological assistance may overcome the unfamiliarity with telemedicine and drastically reduce the learning time for both patients and medical personnel. Objectives: The research work presents a method to improve the user experience of a telemedicine service based on the combination of televisits and telemonitoring with wearable sensors for heart failure patients. Skilled technological staff is proposed by the presented method to lead the learning process of both medical personnel and patients in order to reach a high level of usability in less than 6 months. Methods: The proposed method is composed of 5 steps: identification of technological staff and end users; selection of the telemedicine platform; design of questionnaires for usability analysis; training of clinicians and patients; final usability evaluation of the telemedicine platform by means of customized satisfaction questionnaires and Post-Study System Usability Questionnaires (PSSUQs). The methodological approach has been tested in collaboration with a heart failure clinic by involving 5 physicians, 5 nurses, 15 heart failure patients, a research engineer and 4 technicians. A platform with 3 wearable sensors has been chosen: a wireless thermometer, a finger pulse-oximeter and an undershirt have been used for the detection of ECG trace. While these devices allowed asynchronous measurements of physiological data, scheduled televisits have been used for direct communication between physicians and patients. Results: Satisfaction questionnaires of patients and clinicians reached respectively 65.18% and 65.83%, while PSSUQ scores were respectively 91.73% and 81.70%. Both groups of end users confirmed a good level of usability and their satisfaction about the ease of use and the perceived quality of the instrumentation. Moreover, 73% of patients did not require help from caregivers to use the kit of sensors. The results have been reached in 5.5 months according to the aim defined initially. Research engineers have played a crucial role in helping clinicians and patients to improve the user experience with the telemedicine platform. Conclusions: The high level of usability and satisfaction confirmed that the proposed methodological approach helps to learn the technological features of the telemedicine platforms, which are based on different types of technology, such as web applications, wearable sensors and virtual calls. The positive results with heart failure patients encouraged to plan further research studies by using the designed method with other categories of chronic patients. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Flexible pressure sensors have been studied as wearable voice-recognition devices to be utilized in human-machine interaction. However, the development of highly sensitive, skin-attachable, and comfortable sensing devices to achieve clear voice detection remains a considerable challenge. Herein, we present a wearable and flexible pressure and temperature sensor with a sensitive response to vibration, which can accurately recognize the human voice by combing with the artificial neural network. The device consists of a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) printed with a silver electrode, a filament-microstructured polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) film embedded with single-walled carbon nanotubes and a polyimide (PI) film sputtered with a patterned Ti/Pt thermistor strip. The developed pressure sensor exhibited a pressure sensitivity of 0.398 kPa−1 in the low-pressure regime, and the fabricated temperature sensor shows a desirable temperature coefficient of resistance of 0.13%◦ C in the range of 25◦ C to 105◦ C. Through training and testing the neural network model with the waveform data of the sensor obtained from human pronunciation, the vocal fold vibrations of different words can be successfully recognized, and the total recognition accuracy rate can reach 93.4%. Our results suggest that the fabricated sensor has substantial potential for application in the human-computer interface fields, such as voice control, vocal healthcare monitoring, and voice authentication. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Introduction: Vertigo, dizziness, gaze instability and disequilibrium are highly prevalent in people with MS (PwMS) and head movement induced dizziness is commonly reported. Vestibular physical therapy (VPT) is a specialised, non-invasive and effective therapy for these problems but usually involves travel for the person to a specialist center with both personal and carbon costs. The use of wearable sensors to track head movement and smartphone applications to deliver and track programs has potential to improve VPT in MS. Methods: This study investigated the usability and effects of a commercially available digital VPT system (wearable head sensor, smartphone app and clinician software) to deliver VPT to PwMS. A pre/post treatment design was employed and the primary outcome was the System Usability Scale (SUS). Other patient reported outcomes were the Service User Acceptability Questionnaire (SUTAQ), the Patient Enablement Instrument (PEI) and the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI). Physical outcomes measurements included Mini-BESTest (MB), Modified Dynamic Gait Index (mDGI), Gait Speed (GS), Dynamic Visual Acuity (DVA) and head kinematics and symptoms during exercise. Results: Sixteen PwMS (14 female), mean age 44(±14) years were recruited to the study and twelve completed VPT. Mean adherence to exercise, measured digitally was 60% (±18.4). SUS scores were high at 81 (±14) and SUTAQ scores also demonstrated high levels of satisfaction and acceptability of the system. Statistically significant improvements in MB (mean change 2.25; p = 0.004), mDGI (median change 1.00; p = 0.008), DVA (median change −1.00; p = 0.004) were found. Head frequencies significantly improved with concurrent decreased intensity of dizziness during head movements (mean change across 4 gaze stabilization exercises was 23 beats per minute; p < 0.05). Non-significant improvements were seen in DHI (p = 0.07) and GS (p = 0.15). 64.5% of follow up visits were conducted remotely (video or phone), facilitated by the system. Discussion: This study had two main outcomes and benefits for PwMS. Firstly, we showed that the system used was both acceptable and could be used by PwMS. Secondly, we demonstrated an improvement in a range of dizziness, balance and gait metrics with remotely delivered care. This system has the potential to positively impact on MS physiotherapy service provision with the potential to deliver effective remote care. 2024 Meldrum, Kearney, Hutchinson, McCarthy and Quinn.

AB  - Background: During the 30-day period prior to initiating dialysis, there is a 10-fold rise in emergency department visits and hospitalizations related to kidney failure. Objective: The Virtual Ward Incorporating Electronic Wearables (VIEWER) trial implemented a home telemonitoring system to track changes in patients’ vitals and assess their adherence and the acceptability of telemonitoring in a chronic kidney disease (CKD) population. Design: A pilot prospective clinical trial using a mixed methods approach was performed. Setting: The research was conducted in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Participants: There were 2 phases: Phase 1 was a 2-week-long pilot trial consisting of 10 participants. Phase 2 was a 3-month-long trial with a total of 26 participants. Patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate <15 and a >40% risk of beginning dialysis in the next 2 years according to the kidney failure risk equation were eligible to participate in the study. Methods: The primary quantitative outcome was adherence, defined as the proportion of daily self-assessments completed using VIEWER over the follow-up period. The usability and acceptability of VIEWER was assessed qualitatively at the end of the trial through structured questionnaires and focus groups. Results: Phase 1 participants (n = 10) had a median adherence of 77.17% for the 2-week observation period. Phase 2 participants (n = 26) showed a lower median adherence of 36% for the 3-month period. Focus group participants (n = 11) identified many positive aspects of VIEWER, including increased awareness and empowerment over health, simplicity of the data platform, and the ability to show clinical staff their health trends. Some challenges identified with VIEWER were connectivity issues with the Bluetooth, perceived inconvenience, and negative thoughts toward their health Limitations: Limitations of the study include a small sample size, which limited our ability to measure quantitative outcomes. In addition, patients agreeing to participate in any trial are generally more highly motivated and engaged in their care than those declining participation. Therefore, our results may not be generalizable to individuals who are not interested in self-management of their health. Conclusion: Our results suggest that home telemonitoring in patients with advanced CKD is feasible using a CKD-specific platform like VIEWER. We anticipate that improved functionality with incorporation of feedback from this study will result in greater long-term adherence. A future randomized clinical trial is planned. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - Background: Clinical trials often face challenges in efficient data collection and participant monitoring. To address these issues, we developed the IMPACT platform, comprising a real-time mobile application for data collection and a web-based dashboard for remote monitoring and management. Methods: This article presents the design, development, and usability assessment of the IMPACT platform customized for patients with post-bariatric surgery hypoglycemia (PBH). We focus on adapting key IMPACT components, including continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), symptom tracking, and meal logging, as crucial elements for user-friendly and efficient PBH monitoring. Results: The adapted IMPACT platform demonstrated effectiveness in data collection and remote participant monitoring. The mobile application allowed patients to easily track their data, while the clinician dashboard provided a comprehensive overview of enrolled patients, featuring filtering options and alert mechanisms for identifying data collection issues. The platform incorporated various visual representations, including time plots and category-based visualizations, which greatly facilitated data interpretation and analysis. The System Usability Scale questionnaire results indicated a high level of usability for the web dashboard, with an average score of 86.3 out of 100. The active involvement of clinicians throughout the development process ensured that the platform allowed for the collection and visualization of clinically meaningful data. Conclusions: By leveraging IMPACT’s existing features and infrastructure, the adapted version streamlined data collection, analysis, and trial customization for PBH research. The platform’s high usability underscores its alignment with the requirements for conducting research using continuous real-world data in PBH patients and other populations of interest. © 2023 Diabetes Technology Society.

AB  - This research presents an all-in-one portable vital sign (PVS) measurement device integrated with a cloud platform for remote patient monitoring in a home isolation setting. The study aims to evaluate the device's usability by comparing its vital sign measurements with clinical vital sign simulators and conducting trials with mild symptom COVID-19 patients. The PVS device successfully demonstrates a high level of agreement with the clinical vital sign simulators, signifying its reliability in providing accurate data based on Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Furthermore, when assessed by mild symptom COVID-19 patients, the device exhibits 95% confidence interval agreement with standard home use vital sign devices in measuring blood pressure, pulse rate, SpO2, and temperature using the Bland–Altman method. The findings suggest that the conceptual PVS device may be used in diverse healthcare settings, including elderly community healthcare and acute respiratory infection (ARI) units. Future work will involve integrating edge computing to enhance connectivity reliability and reduce data transmission delays, further improving the system’s efficiency. Overall, this innovative research lays the groundwork for broader applications of the PVS cloud-based system, contributing to advancements in remote patient monitoring and effective healthcare resource management in challenging healthcare scenarios. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.

AB  - Background: A critical factor in healing diabetic foot ulcers is patient adherence to offloading devices. We tested a smart offloading boot (SmartBoot) combined with a smartwatch app and cloud dashboard to remotely monitor patient adherence and activity. In addition, the impact of SmartBoot on balance, gait, and user experience was investigated. Methods: Fourteen volunteers (31.6±8.7 years; 64% female) performed natural activities (eg, sitting, standing, walking) with and without the SmartBoot for approximately 30 minutes. All participants completed balance tests, 10-meter walking tests at slow, normal, and fast pace while wearing the SmartBoot, and a user experience questionnaire. The accuracy of real-time adherence reporting was assessed by comparing the SmartBoot and staff observation. Center of mass (COM) sway and step counts were measured using a validated wearable system. Results: Average sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for adherence and non-adherence were 90.6%, 88.0%, and 89.3%, respectively. The COM sway area was significantly smaller with the SmartBoot than without the SmartBoot regardless of test condition. Step count error was 4.4% for slow waking, 36.2% for normal walking, 16.0% for fast walking. Most participants agreed that the SmartBoot is easy to use, relatively comfortable, nonintrusive, and innovative. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first smart offloading system that enables remote patient monitoring and real-time adherence and activity reporting. The SmartBoot enhanced balance performance, likely due to somatosensory feedback. Questionnaire results highlight SmartBoot’s technical and clinical potential. Future studies warrant clinical validation of real-time non-adherence alerting to improve wound healing outcomes in people with diabetic foot ulcers. © 2022 Diabetes Technology Society.

AB  - Background: Parkinson disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with a variety of motor and nonmotor symptoms. Many of these symptoms can be monitored by eHealth solutions, including smartphone apps, wearable sensors, and camera systems. The usability of such systems is a key factor in long-term use, but not much is known about the predictors of successful use and preferable methods to assess usability in patients with PD. Objective: This study tested methods to assess usability and determined prerequisites for successful use in patients with PD. Methods: We performed comprehensive usability assessments with 18 patients with PD using a mixed methods usability battery containing the System Usability Scale, a rater-based evaluation of device-specific tasks, and qualitative interviews. Each patient performed the usability battery with 2 of 3 randomly assigned devices: a tablet app, wearable sensors, and a camera system. The usability battery was administered at the beginning and at the end of a 4-day testing period. Between usability batteries, the systems were used by the patients during 3 sessions of motor assessments (wearable sensors and camera system) and at the movement disorder ward (tablet app). Results: In this study, the rater-based evaluation of tasks discriminated the best between the 3 eHealth solutions, whereas subjective modalities such as the System Usability Scale were not able to distinguish between the systems. Successful use was associated with different clinical characteristics for each system: eHealth literacy and cognitive function predicted successful use of the tablet app, and better motor function and lower age correlated with the independent use of the camera system. The successful use of the wearable sensors was independent of clinical characteristics. Unfortunately, patients who were not able to use the devices well provided few improvement suggestions in qualitative interviews. Conclusions: eHealth solutions should be developed with a specific set of patients in mind and subsequently tested in this cohort. For a complete picture, usability assessments should include a rater-based evaluation of task performance, and there is a need to develop strategies to circumvent the underrepresentation of poorly performing patients in qualitative usability research. © Jonas Bendig, Anja Spanz, Jana Leidig, Anika Frank, Marcus Stahr, Heinz Reichmann, Kai F Loewenbrück, Björn H Falkenburger.

AB  - Effective healthcare monitoring and tracking solutions for senior individuals are urgently needed given the growing geriatric population and rising healthcare expenses. In order to provide a complete healthcare monitoring and tracking wristband for senior people, this research study suggests a wristwatch system using ESP-32 and Arduino N ano microcontrollers. Heart rate monitoring, fall detection, sleepwalk detection, GPS tracking, medication reminders, temperature monitoring, and an emergency SOS button are just a few of the functionalities that the wristband incorporates from a variety of sensors. Caretakers may check on the old person's health from a distance thanks to the technology, which transmits real-time health information to a specialized smartphone app. The technology sends notifications to surrounding caretakers in the event of crises or unstable health metrics. The suggested wristband has the potential to improve older people's quality of life by encouraging preventative care and allowing them to safely age in place. To solve usability and privacy issues, however, more development and user testing are essential. The results of the research indicate that this cutting-edge wristwatch technology has the potential to greatly enhance healthcare outcomes for the senior population.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - A wireless acoustic wearable system was designed to directly measure wearers' heart and respiratory rates from their chest sounds and record segments concerning chest sounds. These measurements and associated recordings are provided to healthcare providers as a real-time monitor or medical log for later review. The system was validated by healthy volunteers with two gold-standard devices commonly used in healthcare settings. Both gold standard reference devices are United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared and CE-marked. Twenty-six adult volunteers between the ages of 21 and 80 were recruited. The device achieved an accuracy of ± 2.8 beats per minute (BPM) for heart rate measurement against a heart rate measurement reference of ± 3 BPM accuracy. Compared with respiratory rate measurement reference with ± 1 breath per minute (BRPM) accuracy, the devices achieved ± 0.7 BRPM accuracy. Furthermore, the usability survey result of 17 healthcare professionals and 28 lay users showed that both healthcare professionals (HCPs) and lay users could operate the system without guidance. 88% of the HCPs regarded the system to be helpful as a tool for remote patient monitoring, and 94% of the lay users agreed that the system was easy to use. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - The prevalence of Heart Failure is growing exponentially in the last decades, particularly amongst older adults. Heart Failure is a chronic cardiovascular disease that demands self-care management and substantial healthcare resources. For that reason, it is highly associated with hospital readmissions and mortality. Due to increased hospitalization costs, excessive waiting times and lack of specialized healthcare professionals to follow-up this growing population, telemedicine and telemonitoring technologies have become the best solutions to support health providers in the disease management tasks. Telemonitoring technologies offer better and more comfortable care because the elderly do not have to leave the comfort of their home to interact with the doctors, giving and receiving daily feedbacks trough these new applications, wearables, and health care platforms. This paper provides a comprehensive review covering the current progress of research in telemedicine and telemonitoring and their applications to Heart Failure Management services. It presents SmartBEAT, which demonstrated during a pilot phase, a user adherence of 97% for three months. Furthermore, SmartBEAT plus, an improved solution, is described, and the system usability a technology acceptance will be evaluated through a pilot with 40 Heart Failure Patients, involving nurses and cardiologists. © 2020 The authors and IOS Press.

AB  - Telediabetes may improve patient access to clinicians who specialize in the management of pediatric diabetes. Due to the diversity of telehealth modes, many different service models for pediatric telediabetes have been developed. This review describes pediatric telediabetes service models identified in the literature, investigates the reported changes in HbA1c of these interventions, and describes enablers and barriers to implementing a telediabetes service. Evaluation of current literature may inform the development and sustainability of telehealth services for pediatric diabetes management. Twenty-nine studies met inclusion criteria and were reviewed. This review has demonstrated that pediatric telediabetes can be delivered by remote monitoring and real-time videoconference modes. Overall, pediatric telediabetes increased interactions between patients and clinicians, improved access to specialized care, and facilitated increased diabetes monitoring. In some contexts, telediabetes also improved short-term glycemic control. Key enablers reported for telediabetes services were integration with existing workflows, dedicated staff, clinician and patient training, appropriate data security, technology with good usability, and the availability of technical support. Barriers included increases in patient responsibilities and clinician workload, and technical issues with equipment and software.  © Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2020.

AB  - The surge in popularity of wireless headphones, particularly wireless earbuds, as smart wearables, has been notable in recent years. These devices, empowered by artificial intelligence (AI), are broadening their utility in areas such as speech recognition, augmented reality, pose recognition, and health care monitoring, thereby enriching user experiences through novel interactive interfaces driven by embedded sensors. However, the widespread adoption of wireless earbuds has spurred concerns regarding security and privacy, necessitating robust bespoke security measures. Despite the miniaturization of mobile chips enabling the integration of sophisticated algorithms into smart wearables, the research and industrial communities have yet to accord adequate attention to earbud security. This article focuses on empowering wireless earbuds to authenticate their legitimate users, tackling the challenges associated with conventional authentication methods. Instead of relying on input interface authentication methods like PIN or lock patterns, this research delves into leveraging inertial measurement unit (IMU) data collected during interactions with devices to extract novel biometric features, presenting an alternative approach that nonetheless confronts challenges related to signal capture and interference. Consequently, we propose and design BudsAuth, an implicit user authentication framework that harnesses built-in IMU sensors in smart earbuds to capture vibration signals induced by on-face touching interactions with the earbuds. These vibrations are utilized to deliver continuous and implicit user authentication with high precision and compatibility across various earbud models. Extensive evaluation demonstrates BudsAuth's capability to achieve an equal error rate (EER) of 0.0003, representing an approximate 99.97% accuracy with seven consecutive samples of interactive gestures for implicit authentication.  © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals with a positive viral test were enrolled in a study, within 48 hours, to remotely monitor their vital signs to characterize disease progression and recovery. A virtual trial design was adopted to reduce risks to participants and the research community in a study titled Risk Stratification and Early Alerting Regarding COVID-19 Hospitalization (RiskSEARCH). The Food and Drug Administration-cleared Current Health platform with a wearable device is a continuous remote patient monitoring technology that supports hospital-at-home care and is used as a data collection tool. Enrolled participants wore the Current Health wearable device continuously for up to 30 days and took a daily symptom survey via a tablet that was provided. A qualitative substudy was conducted in parallel to better understand virtual trial implementation, including barriers and facilitators for participants. Objective: This study aimed to understand the barriers and facilitators of the user experience of interacting with a virtual care platform and research team, while participating in a fully virtual study using qualitative and quantitative data. Methods: Semistructured interviews were conducted to understand participants' experience of participating in a virtual study during a global pandemic. The schedule included their experience of enrollment and their interactions with equipment and study staff. A total of 3 RiskSEARCH participants were interviewed over telephone, and transcriptions were inductively coded and analyzed using thematic analysis. Themes were mapped onto the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) to identify and describe the factors that influenced study adherence. Quantitative metrics, including adherence to wearable and scheduled tasks collected as part of the RiskSEARCH main study, were paired with the interviews to present an overall picture of participation. Results: All participants exceeded our definition of a fully adherent participant and reported that participation was feasible and had a low burden. The symptoms progressively resolved during the trial. Inductive thematic analysis identified 13 main themes from the interview data, which were deductively mapped onto 11 of the 14 TDF domains, highlighting barriers and facilitators for each. Conclusions: Participants in the RiskSEARCH substudy showed high levels of adherence and engagement throughout participation. Although participants experienced some challenges in setting up and maintaining the Current Health kit (eg, charging devices), they reported feeling that the requirements of participation were both reasonable and realistic. We demonstrated that the TDF can be used for inductive thematic analysis. We anticipate expanding this work in future virtual studies and trials to identify barriers and enabling factors for implementation. © Juliana Pugmire, Jessie Lever Taylor, Matt Wilkes, Adam Wolfberg, Nicole Zahradka.

AB  - Mobile applications, wearables, in-home medical devices and other peripherals are reshaping consumer participation in healthcare. While much research has focused on patient facing mobile technologies, there remains limited evidence of the implications of technologies on models of care and health service delivery. In this paper, we present an evaluation of the clinician experiences of using a bidirectional healthcare platform, Activate TKR, for orthopaedic patients undergoing a Total Knee Replacement (TKR). The platform provides mobile-enabled media rich content to support patients through their journey, while facilitating data sharing and remote monitoring by clinicians. Results show that physiotherapists experienced the greatest enhancements in care delivery through access to patient generated information which improved appointments, status and progress discussion, and tailoring of physiotherapy. Surgeons found value in the mobile-enabled information patients accessed in preparation for surgery, enhancing their overall TKR experience. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Background: Mobile health is a promising strategy aiming to anticipate and prevent the deterioration of health status in palliative cancer patients. A prerequisite for successful implementation of this technology into clinical routine is a high level of usability and acceptance of devices. Objectives: We aimed to evaluate feasibility as well as patients' acceptance of remote monitoring using wearables in palliative cancer patients. Methods: In this prospective single-center observational feasibility study, 30 cancer patients treated with palliative intent in an inpatient setting with an estimated life expectancy of >8 weeks and <12 months were provided with a smartphone including a pre-installed "Activity Monitoring" app and a sensor-equipped bracelet and monitored over a period of 12 weeks starting at discharge from hospital. We report detailed feasibility and usability aspects and comment on patients' acceptance of the wearables. Results: Between February 2017 and May 2018 a total of 30 patients were included in the study. From these, 25 participants (83%) completed the whole study period. On average, the bracelet was worn on 53% and smartphone used on 85% of the study days. The completion rate of daily digital questionnaires for subjective ratings (pain and distress scale) was 73%, and 28 patients were able to handle the wearables and to operate the app without major problems. Use of the bracelet was low during the night hours, with a wearing time of 1.7% of all night hours (8 p.m. to 8 a.m.). Conclusions: Remote monitoring of health care status in palliative cancer patients with a limited life expectancy is feasible and patients are able to handle the smartphone and the sensor-equipped bracelet. Feedback towards use of this monitoring system was mostly positive. © 2019 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Telemonitoring is a branch of telehealth that aims at remotely monitoring vital signs, which is important for chronically ill patients and the elderly living alone. The available standalone devices and applications for the self-monitoring of health parameters largely suffer from interoperability problems; meanwhile, telemonitoring medical devices are expensive, self-contained, and are not integrated into user-friendly technological platforms for the end user. This paper presents the technical aspects and usability assessment of the telemonitoring features of the HEREiAM platform, which supports heterogeneous information technology systems. By exploiting a service-oriented architecture, the measured parameters collected by off-the-shelf Bluetooth medical devices are sent as XML documents to a private cloud that implements an interoperable health service infrastructure, which is compliant with the most recent healthcare standards and security protocols. This Android-based system is designed to be accessible both via TV and portable devices, and includes other utilities designed to support the elderly living alone. Four usability assessment sessions with quality-validated questionnaires were performed to accurately understand the ease of use, usefulness, acceptance, and quality of the proposed system. The results reveal that our system achieved very high usability scores even at its first use, and the scores did not significantly change over time during a field trial that lasted for four months, reinforcing the idea of an intuitive design. At the end of such a trial, the user-experience questionnaire achieved excellent scores in all aspects with respect to the benchmark. Good results were also reported by general practitioners who assessed the quality of their remote interfaces for telemonitoring. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Background: Monitoring mental health outcomes has traditionally been based on heuristic decisions, often based on scarce, subjective evidence, making the clinical decisions made by professionals, as well as the monitoring of these diseases, subject to flaws. However, the digital phenotype, which refers to the analysis of data collected by measuring human behavior with mobile sensors and smart bracelets, is a promising tool for filling this gap in current clinical practice. Objective: The objectives of this study are to develop the digital phenotyping of patients with alcohol use disorder and anxiety symptoms using data collected from a mobile device (ie, smartphone) and a wearable sensor (ie, Fitbit) and to analyze usability and patient satisfaction with the data collection service provided by the app. Methods: We propose to conduct a study among a group of 60 participants split into two subgroups—experimental and control—of 30 participants each. The experimental group will be recruited by physicians from the Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, and the control group will be recruited on a volunteer basis through fliers and social media. All participants will go through pretraining to ensure technological capability and understanding of tasks, then each participant will download the HumanITcare app and will be given a wearable sensor (ie, Fitbit). Throughout the 4-month period, participants will be monitored on a range of factors, including sleep cycle, heart rate, movement patterns, and sociability. All data from the wearable sensors and the mobile devices will be saved and sent to the HumanITcare server. Participants will be asked to complete weekly questionnaires about anxiety, depression, and alcohol use disorder symptoms. Research assistants will ensure timely responses. The data from both sensors will then be compared to the questionnaire responses to determine how accurately the devices can predict the same symptoms. Results: The recruitment phase was completed in November 2019 and all the data were collected by the end of December 2019. Data are being processed; this process is expected to be completed by October 2020. Conclusions: This study was created and conducted as a pilot study with the Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, with the purpose of exploring the feasibility of our approach. The study is focused on patients diagnosed with anxiety and alcohol use disorder, but participants were also monitored for depressive symptoms throughout the trial, although these were not part of the initial inclusion criteria. A limitation to our study was the exclusive use of Android smartphones over iOS devices; this could result in a potential selection bias, due to the accessibility and affordability of Android phones as opposed to iOS-based phones. Another limitation might be that reviews of usability and satisfaction could be confounded by factors such as age and familiarity. An additional function that we might add in future studies is the ability for patients to manage their own data. ©Núria Pastor, Elizabeth Khalilian, Elsa Caballeria, Danielle Morrison, Unai Sanchez Luque, Silvia Matrai, Antoni Gual, Hugo López-Pelayo.

AB  - About 1% of newborns have congenital heart disease at birth. This generally does not imply death, but it leads to multiple hospitalizations and outpatient visits. In addition, it results in a negative impact on quality of life for the children themselves and for their families. Telemedicine platforms can be employed in this field, to reduce the number of hospital admissions and check-ups and to improve the communication between parents/caregivers and the hospital staff. The aim of the AIR CARDIO project is to evaluate the impact, efficiency and effectiveness of a home telemonitoring system for children with congenital heart disease. The vital signs (i.e. ECG, heart rate, body temperature, body weight and oxygen saturation) are collected by some biomedical sensors and sent to a smart-hub. The smart-hub proceeds then to the synchronization with the e-Health care center, enabling the doctors to evaluate the patient's parameters. Some questionnaires are also provided to parents/caregivers through the application, for the evaluation of the effects of the system on quality of life. In the clinical trial, which lasts 12 months, 45 patients are recruited from the U.O.C. Paediatric and Adult Congenital Cardiology - Monasterio Foundation. Preliminary results highlight suitability of the sensors selected for children and good usability of the smart-hub technology. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - The desire to maintain an independent lifestyle is one shared by an increasing number of older adults. Adult children, spouses, siblings, and other relatives, also known as family caregivers, play an integral role in helping their loved ones maintain independence. Remote monitoring technologies (RMTs) such as wearable sensors, mobile emergency devices, smartphone apps, and webcams can be used to monitor, sense, record, and communicate a person’s daily activities. However, understanding is limited of the family caregiver’s needs and perceptions of RMTs used in a home-based setting. The purpose was to explore how family caregivers perceive RMTs and their use for monitoring and supporting their care recipients who choose to live independently. We used a survey to capture some basic characteristics of family caregivers, what they know about RMTs, and to recruit interview participants. We conducted semi-structured interviews with four participants who shared the commonality of caring for a relative with dementia. We reported the survey data using descriptive statistics and we applied interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) to analyze and report results from the interviews. Four themes emerged including the unique relationships that exist in family care, the risk-benefit conundrum that accompanies benefits and tradeoffs of RMT use, human-technology interaction and usability, and the importance of creating tailored solutions to facilitate RMT adoption and use. Our findings provide insight into factors impacting adoption and use. Copyright 2020: Martha M. Snyder, Laurie P.

AB  - This article describes the design, development and implementation of a set of microservices based on an architecture that enables detection and assisted clinical diagnosis within the field of infectious diseases of elderly patients, via a telemonitoring system. The proposed system is designed to continuously update a medical database fed with vital signs from biosensor kits applied by nurses to elderly people on a daily basis. The database is hosted in the cloud and is managed by a flexible microservices software architecture. The computational paradigms of the edge and the cloud were used in the implementation of a hybrid cloud architecture in order to support versatile high-performance applications under the microservices pattern for the pre-diagnosis of infectious diseases in elderly patients. The results of an analysis of the usability of the equipment, the performance of the architecture and the service concept show that the proposed e-health system is feasible and innovative. The system components are also selected to give a cost-effective implementation for people living in disadvantaged areas. The proposed e-health system is also suitable for distributed computing, big data and NoSQL structures, thus allowing the immediate application of machine learning and AI algorithms to discover knowledge patterns from the overall population.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - This article serves as the introduction to this special issue on Mobile Health and Mobile Rehabilitation for People with Disabilities. Social, technological and policy trends are reviewed. Needs, opportunities and challenges for the emerging fields of mobile health (mHealth, aka eHealth) and mobile rehabilitation (mRehab) are discussed. Healthcare in the United States (U.S.) is at a critical juncture characterized by: (1) a growing need for healthcare and rehabilitation services; (2) maturing technological capabilities to support more effective and efficient health services; (3) evolving public policies designed, by turns, to contain cost and support new models of care; and (4) a growing need to ensure acceptance and usability of new health technologies by people with disabilities and chronic conditions, clinicians and health delivery systems. Discussion of demographic and population health data, healthcare service delivery and a public policy primarily focuses on the U.S. However, trends identified (aging populations, growing prevalence of chronic conditions and disability, labor shortages in healthcare) apply to most countries with advanced economies and others. Furthermore, technologies that enable mRehab (wearable sensors, in-home environmental monitors, cloud computing, artificial intelligence) transcend national boundaries. Remote and mobile healthcare delivery is needed and inevitable. Proactive engagement is critical to ensure acceptance and effectiveness for all stakeholders. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The accurate individuals' activities description is an important assignments in human computer interface. Many applications can be developed based on correct and fast activity recognition, such as healthcare monitoring and fall detection applications. Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is an active research field, where some key factors still challenging and need to be enhanced for faster and accurate recognition. This paper presents a novel approach aims to improve the activity recognition time by aggregating the raw data from inertial sensors into one time series used as input, then various features are extracted from the resulted signal by dimensionality reduction procedure, Those features are used as input data for the classification algorithm without affecting the information associated with activity in the raw data. The results of the novel method showed an improvement in recognition time while retaining the same level of accuracy. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Smart wearables help real-time and remote monitoring of health data for effective diagnostic and preventive health care services. Wearable devices have the ability to track and monitor healthcare vitals such as heart rate, physical activities, BMI (Body Mass Index), blood pressure, and keeps an individual notified about the health status. Artificial Intelligence-enabled wearables show an ability to transform the health insurance sector. This would not only enable self-management of individual health but also help them focus from treatments to the preventions of health hazards. With this customer-centric approach to health care, it will enable the insurance companies to track the health behaviour of the individuals. This can perhaps lead to better incentivization models with a lower premium to the health-centric customers. Health insurance companies can have better outreach with these customer-centric products. The area is exceptionally novel and shows potential for the research opportunities. Although the literature shows the presence of few works incepting the application of smart wearables in health insurance, it was found that the works are across sections of the society and extremely limited to regions and boundaries. Thus, a need for Bibliometric survey in the area of Smart Wearables in Health insurance is necessary to track the research trends, progress and scope of the future research. This paper conducts Bibliometric study for “Smart Wearables in Health Insurance Industry” by extracting documents of total 287 from Scopus database using keywords like wearables, health insurance, health care, machine learning and health risk prediction. The study is conducted since the last decade that is 2011-2020 for the research analysis. From the study, it is observed that application of wearables in health insurance are in a nascent stage and there is a scope for researchers, insurance, health care stakeholders to explore the used cases for a better user experience.  © 2020, Library Philosophy and Practice (e-journal).

AB  - The paper describes the evolution in design and implementation of a new complex electro-informatics assistive medical system used for the communication with neuromotor disabled patients. These patients are severe handicapped persons who cannot interfere with real world by normal ways like speech, writing or language signs. Fortunately, these persons can see or can hear and they understand the meaning of different messages. The developed medical system is made by the following main functional components: the patient equipment, server, and caretaker device, connected together by using Internet available infrastructure. The bidirectional communication is performed by using keywords technology or ideograms presented on the patient’s screen provided by an application running at the server and accessed by the patient through a web browser. Patient needs are performed by using for interfacing with a software application by using different types of sensors including switch-type sensors (tactile, pressure, strain gauge) or eye tracking devices, all of these adapted to the patient’s physical condition. The medical system has also a secondary function, the remote monitoring of few vital physiological parameters needed for patient treatment and rehabilitation, based on wireless and wearable sensor network, that share the same hardware platform. The application running on caretaker device displays the patient’s needs together with the values of the selected physiological parameters in real time. The medical devices are responsible for physiological parameters acquiring, preprocessing and forwarding into the server. The server performs the parameters processing and computing the medical condition of the patient and also has the ability of sending alerts to the caretaker when one or more parameters are outside the normal limits. The application running on server manages the system databases, the communication protocols between patient and caretaker devices, records and processes the remote monitored data values and alarms the caretaker devices in emergency situations. The prototype of the developed medical system has been successfully within Clinic of “Geriatrics and Gerontology” at “Dr. C. I. Parhon” Hospital of Iaşi, Romania. The assistive solution proposed can be used in hospitals, care and treatment centers, nursing homes and also for patients treated in outpatient settings. The system contributes to increasing the level of care and treatment for neuromotor disabled patients, lowering costs in health care system. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - It is the dawn of new computing era—Internet of Things (IoT). It consists of seamless blending of sensors, which monitor the environment around us and actuators, that respond to the decisions taken by a strong framework of cloud computing. The lifestyle changes of people have been resulting in increase in their health problems. This demands a need for cyber-physical smart pervasive frameworks involving ubiquitous healthcare system. The health care is one of the number of application domains of Internet of Things. With Internet of Things, many medical applications can be developed such as monitoring health remotely, fitness programs, elderly care, and chronic diseases with an idea to reduce costs, increase quality of life, and enrich the user’s experience. Many countries and organizations have been developing policies and guidelines for deploying the Internet of Things technology in medical field. However, the Internet of Things is in its infancy state in the area of healthcare field. Thus, this paper focuses on discussing core technologies that are shaping Internet of Things-based healthcare. Further, the paper provides challenges that must be addressed so that the Internet of Things-based healthcare system becomes robust. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2020.

AB  - In the last months, the market for personal wearable devices has been booming significantly, and, in particular, smartwatches are starting to assume a fundamental role in the Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) arena as well as in the more general Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem, by acting both as sensitive data sources and as user identity proxies. These new roles, complementing the more traditional personal assistance and telemetry/tracking ones, open new perspectives in their integration in complex IoT-based critical infrastructures such as e-payment, health care monitoring, and emergency systems, as well as in their usage as remote control facilities in smart services. Users can access their IoT devices at any time from any place through smartwatches. We argue that this new scenario calls for a strengthened and more resilient authentication of users on these devices, despite their limitations in terms of dimensions and hardware constraints that may considerably affect the usability of security mechanisms. In this article, we present an innovative authentication scheme targeted at smartwatches, namely CirclePIN, that provides both resilience to most common attacks and a high level of usability in tests with real users. © 2020 ACM.

AB  - Background: Due to demographic change and, more recently, coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the importance of modern intensive care units (ICU) is becoming apparent. One of the key components of an ICU is the continuous monitoring of patients' vital parameters. However, existing advances in informatics, signal processing, or engineering that could alleviate the burden on ICUs have not yet been applied. This could be due to the lack of user involvement in research and development. Objective: This study focused on the satisfaction of ICU staff with current patient monitoring and their suggestions for future improvements. We aimed to identify aspects of monitoring that interrupt patient care, display devices for remote monitoring, use cases for artificial intelligence (AI), and whether ICU staff members are willing to improve their digital literacy or contribute to the improvement of patient monitoring. We further aimed to identify differences in the responses of different professional groups. Methods: This survey study was performed with ICU staff from 4 ICUs of a German university hospital between November 2019 and January 2020. We developed a web-based 36-item survey questionnaire, by analyzing a preceding qualitative interview study with ICU staff, about the clinical requirements of future patient monitoring. Statistical analyses of questionnaire results included median values with their bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals, and chi-square tests to compare the distributions of item responses of the professional groups. Results: In total, 86 of the 270 ICU physicians and nurses completed the survey questionnaire. The majority stated they felt confident using the patient monitoring equipment, but that high rates of false-positive alarms and the many sensor cables interrupted patient care. Regarding future improvements, respondents asked for wireless sensors, a reduction in the number of false-positive alarms, and hospital standard operating procedures for alarm management. Responses to the display devices proposed for remote patient monitoring were divided. Most respondents indicated it would be useful for earlier alerting or when they were responsible for multiple wards. AI for ICUs would be useful for early detection of complications and an increased risk of mortality; in addition, the AI could propose guidelines for therapy and diagnostics. Transparency, interoperability, usability, and staff training were essential to promote the use of AI. The majority wanted to learn more about new technologies for the ICU and required more time for learning. Physicians had fewer reservations than nurses about AI-based intelligent alarm management and using mobile phones for remote monitoring. Conclusions: This survey study of ICU staff revealed key improvements for patient monitoring in intensive care medicine. Hospital providers and medical device manufacturers should focus on reducing false alarms, implementing hospital alarm standard operating procedures, introducing wireless sensors, preparing for the use of AI, and enhancing the digital literacy of ICU staff. Our results may contribute to the user-centered transfer of digital technologies into practice to alleviate challenges in intensive care medicine. © 2020 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

AB  - Little is known about the experiences and expectations of patients and health care professionals regarding continuous monitoring with these devices. Objective: This study aimed to identify positive and negative effects as well as barriers and facilitators for the use of two wearable devices: ViSi Mobile (VM) and HealthPatch (HP). Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, 90 patients admitted to the internal medicine and surgical wards of a university hospital in the Netherlands were randomly assigned to continuous vital sign monitoring using VM or HP and a control group. Users' experiences and expectations were addressed using semistructured interviews. Nurses, physician assistants, and medical doctors were also interviewed. Interviews were analyzed using thematic content analysis. Psychological distress was assessed using the State Trait Anxiety Inventory and the Pain Catastrophizing Scale. The System Usability Scale was used to assess the usability of both devices. Results: A total of 60 patients, 20 nurses, 3 physician assistants, and 6 medical doctors were interviewed. We identified 47 positive and 30 negative effects and 19 facilitators and 36 barriers for the use of VM and HP. Frequently mentioned topics included earlier identification of clinical deterioration, increased feelings of safety, and VM lines and electrodes. No differences related to psychological distress and usability were found between randomization groups or devices. Conclusions: Both devices were well received by most patients and health care professionals, and the majority of them encouraged the idea of monitoring vital signs continuously in the general ward. This comprehensive overview of barriers and facilitators of using wireless devices may serve as a guide for future researchers, developers, and health care institutions that consider implementing continuous monitoring in the ward. © 2020 Journal of Medical Internet Research.
