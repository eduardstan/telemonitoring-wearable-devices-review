AB  - The rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) brings sweeping changes in various industries. Healthcare industries have become a prime example where the Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT) is making significant progress, particularly in how we approach real-time patient care. Traditional systems for monitoring older people and people with special needs are frequently expensive, require a large workforce, and fall short of providing real-time data. This paper introduces the '3-Tier Health Care Architecture,' an integrated approach to mitigating these issues. This architecture capitalizes on IoHT technologies and is constructed around three principal tiers: Sensor, Fog, and Cloud. The Sensor Tier employs Health Metrics Acquisition Units (HMAUs) fitted with an nRF5340 Development Kit, capturing an extensive range of health-related metrics via wearable sensors. These metrics are then relayed to the Local Processing Units (LPUs) in Fog Tier, which operates on Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W microprocessors for the initial data processing before forwarding to the cloud. The Cloud Tier uses a hybrid CNN-LSTM Machine Learning (ML) model to perform Real-Time Healthcare Monitoring (RTHM) status assessments and includes an Early Warning System for immediate alert issuance. The proposed architecture is resilient, scalable, and efficient, serving as a fortified and all-encompassing solution for RTHM. This enables quick medical interventions, thus elevating healthcare quality and potentially life-saving. © 2024 - IOS Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Human mesh reconstruction is essential for various applications, including virtual reality, motion capture, sports performance analysis, and healthcare monitoring. In healthcare contexts such as nursing homes, it is crucial to employ plausible and non-invasive methods for human mesh reconstruction that preserve privacy and dignity. Traditional vision-based techniques encounter challenges related to occlusion, viewpoint limitations, lighting conditions, and privacy concerns. In this research, we present CAvatar, a real-time human mesh reconstruction approach that innovatively utilizes pressure maps recorded by a tactile carpet as input. This advanced, non-intrusive technology obviates the need for cameras during usage, thereby safeguarding privacy. Our approach addresses several challenges, such as the limited spatial resolution of tactile sensors, extracting meaningful information from noisy pressure maps, and accommodating user variations and multiple users. We have developed an attention-based deep learning network, complemented by a discriminator network, to predict 3D human pose and shape from 2D pressure maps with notable accuracy. Our model demonstrates promising results, with a mean per joint position error (MPJPE) of 5.89 cm and a per vertex error (PVE) of 6.88 cm. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to generate 3D mesh of human activities solely using tactile carpet signals, offering a novel approach that addresses privacy concerns and surpasses the limitations of existing vision-based and wearable solutions.

AB  - The problem addressed in this research is a timely one in modern healthcare: the establishment of advanced health monitoring systems that are capable of drawing intelligent inferences and predictions in real time. By bringing together Internet of Things (IoT) technology and Deep Learning techniques, this research proposes a new approach to the realization of remote patient monitoring (RPM). This system is capable of achieving pervasiveness with today’s vital signs — such as blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation level and cerebral blood flow data — and can provide fall detection using radar sensors, as well as air pollution analysis in indoor environments, thus making the system augmentative and pervasive, not just comprehensive. The research demonstrates the highest accuracy in health anomaly detection and health risk stratification when utilizing Advanced Convolutional Neural Networks for Health Anomaly Detection (ACN-HAD) which are developed and Health Risk Stratification Neural Networks (HRS-NN) to realize the potential for both personalized healthcare and predictive analysis, thus advancing the state of the art in smart healthcare technologies. The results presented have significant potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery and its efficiencies, with the prospect for better patient outcomes. © Little Lion Scientific.

AB  - Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one of the most unremitting and dynamic neurodegenerative human diseases. Various wearable IoT devices have emerged for detecting, diagnosing, and quantifying PD, predominantly utilizing inertial sensors and computational algorithms. However, their proliferation poses novel challenges concerning security, privacy, connectivity, and power optimization. Clinically, continuous monitoring of patients’ motor function is imperative for optimizing Levodopa (L-dopa) dosage while mitigating adverse effects and motor activity decline. Tracking motor function alterations between visits is challenging, risking erroneous clinical decisions. Thus, there is a pressing need to furnish medical professionals with an ecosystem facilitating comprehensive Parkinson’s stage evaluation and disease progression monitoring, particularly regarding tremor and bradykinesia. This study endeavors to establish a holistic ecosystem centered around an energy-efficient Wi-Fi-enabled wearable bracelet dubbed A-WEAR. A-WEAR functions as a data collection conduit for Parkinson’s-related motion data, securely transmitting them to the Cloud for storage, processing, and severity estimation via bespoke learning algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate the resilience and effectiveness of the suggested technique, with 86.4% accuracy for bradykinesia and 90.9% accuracy for tremor estimation, along with good sensitivity and specificity for each scoring class. The recommended approach will support the timely determination of the severity of PD and ongoing patient activity monitoring. The system helps medical practitioners in decision making when initially assessing patients with PD and reviewing their progress and the effects of any treatment. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - This paper introduces an advanced vital sign monitoring system that seamlessly integrates sensor technology, wireless communication and machine learning algorithms to enhance patient care. The system accurately records and interprets vital physiological metrics such as oxygen saturation (SpO2), heart rate, and body temperature. The integration forms the foundation of our comprehensive approach to patient health status classification through machine learning algorithm. We employed three distinct Machine Learning algorithms&#x2014; K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) models to analyze health states, each precisely trained and validated using data collected from sensors on vital sign. This meticulous training aims to enable the models to accurately identify various patient health states, with the KNN model achieving an average accuracy of 92%, while the SVM and SGD models attained even higher accuracies of 94% and 97%, respectively. These outcomes were rigorously validated against established health scoring systems, showcasing the models&#x2019; exceptional performance in multi-class classification scenarios. This is further evidenced by their Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) scores: KNN (0.9021), SVM (0.9841), and SGD (0.9933). The integration of these technologies into our health monitoring system represents a significant advancement in the continuous and comprehensive assessment of patient health, demonstrating the potential of modern technologies to revolutionize healthcare monitoring and management.

AB  - The growing elderly population in smart home environments necessitates increased remote medical support and frequent doctor visits. To address this need, wearable sensor technology plays a crucial role in designing effective healthcare systems for the elderly, facilitating human–machine interaction. However, wearable technology has not been implemented accurately in monitoring various vital healthcare parameters of elders because of inaccurate monitoring. In addition, healthcare providers encounter issues regarding the acceptability of healthcare parameter monitoring and secure data communication within the context of elderly care in smart home environments. Therefore, this research is dedicated to investigating the accuracy of wearable sensors in monitoring healthcare parameters and ensuring secure data transmission. An architectural framework is introduced, outlining the critical components of a comprehensive system, including Sensing, Data storage, and Data communication (SDD) for the monitoring process. These vital components highlight the system's functionality and introduce elements for monitoring and tracking various healthcare parameters through wearable sensors. The collected data is subsequently communicated to healthcare providers to enhance the well-being of elderly individuals. The SDD taxonomy guides the implementation of wearable sensor technology through environmental and body sensors. The proposed system demonstrates the accuracy enhancement of healthcare parameter monitoring and tracking through smart sensors. This study evaluates state-of-the-art articles on monitoring and tracking healthcare parameters through wearable sensors. In conclusion, this study underscores the importance of delineating the SSD taxonomy by classifying the system's major components, contributing to the analysis and resolution of existing challenges. It emphasizes the efficiency of remote monitoring techniques in enhancing healthcare services for the elderly in smart home environments. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize healthcare by automating the detection and classification of events and anomalies. In the scope of this work, events and anomalies are abnormalities in the patient's data, where the former are due to a medical condition, such as a seizure or a fall, and the latter are erroneous data due to faults or malicious attacks. AI-based event and anomaly detection (EAD) and their classification can improve patient outcomes by identifying problems earlier, enabling more timely interventions while minimizing false alarms caused by anomalies. Moreover, the advancement of Medical Internet of Things (MIoT), or wearable devices, and their high processing capabilities facilitated the gathering, AI-based processing, and transmission of data, which enabled remote patient monitoring, and personalized and predictive healthcare. However, it is fundamental in healthcare to ensure the explainability of AI systems, meaning that they can provide understandable and transparent reasoning for their decisions. This article proposes an online EAD approach using a lightweight autoencoder (AE) on the MIoT. The detected abnormality is explained using KernelSHAP, an explainable AI (XAI) technique, where the explanation of the abnormality is used, by an artificial neural network (ANN), to classify it into an event or anomaly. Intensive simulations are conducted using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) data set for various physiological data. Results showed the robustness of the proposed approach in the detection and classification of events, regardless of the percentage of the present anomalies.  © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - The present article underscored the indispensable significance of end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) monitoring in anesthesia and critical care, offering critical insights into both ventilation and metabolism dynamics. The meticulous management of tidal volume, respiratory rate, and inspired oxygen levels during anesthesia plays a pivotal role in maintaining optimal arterial oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations. Effective ventilation is imperative for proper gas exchange within the alveoli and maintaining a stable acid-base balance. In the context of circulatory physiology during anesthesia, cardiac output, blood pressure, and tissue perfusion hold paramount importance. The present article highlights how anesthesia-induced alterations in vascular tone and cardiac function could influence circulation and tissue oxygenation, impacting parameters like blood pressure, heart rate, and ETCO2. Monitoring these parameters provides essential data for assessing circulatory status, guiding anesthesia management, and averting complications. ETCO2 monitoring has evolved into a standard practice in anesthesia and critical care settings, offering real-time, non-invasive insights. The present article delved into the extensive clinical applications, challenges, and future directions of ETCO2 monitoring. Encompassing fundamental principles, technological nuances, clinical implications, limitations, and avenues for research, this article advanced the understanding of this monitoring technique and its positive impact on patient care. The present article also discussed how ETCO2 levels reflect alveolar ventilation, providing critical data for assessing ventilation adequacy, readiness for extubation, and identification of impending respiratory distress. Furthermore, it delved into how ETCO2 levels serve as an indicator of cardiac output and tissue perfusion, guiding management strategies in various shock states and offering prognostic insights during CPR. Challenges and limitations associated with ETCO2 monitoring were clarified, with emphasis on technical considerations, patient populations with specific challenges, and potential interpretation pitfalls. The article outlines the exciting future directions of ETCO2 monitoring, encompassing wearable technology, remote monitoring capabilities, artificial intelligence integration, and potential applications beyond traditional realms. © 2024 Medical Association of Thailand.

AB  - This study presents a novel approach for affective computing through deep learning-assisted electroencephalography (EEG) analysis aimed at enhancing the detection, processing, interpretation, and emulation of human emotions. The proposed methodology introduces an Ear-EEG emotion recognition (EEER) system, leveraging a deep neural network and integrating the Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities. The key contributions of this study include 1) a comprehensive design framework encompassing both hardware and software aspects of the Ear-EEG system, as well as 2) a signals-to-three-channel image conversion method employing time-frequency super-resolution with superlets as inputs for deep learning models. Moreover 3) a modified vision transformer (ViT) architecture is introduced, incorporating shifted patch tokenization (SPT) and locality self-attention (LSA) techniques, addressing challenges associated with limited and imbalanced small datasets, as well as the lack of locality inductive bias for emotion recognition. Additionally, 4) an IoT-assisted EEER platform is proposed, enabling remote monitoring and management. Experimental results indicate that the trained ViT model with SPT and LSA surpasses recent models in terms of performance on untrained datasets, achieving an average accuracy of 92.39%. The findings highlight the efficacy of the proposed EEER system in accurately detecting emotional states, encompassing positive and negative affective states. The integration of artificial intelligence and IoT-based healthcare platforms represents a significant advancement in the development of medical assistant tools with broad implications for future applications. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Noncommunicable diseases (NCD), such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, are defining healthcare challenges of the 21st century. Medical infrastructure, which for decades sought to reduce the incidence and severity of communicable diseases, has proven insufficient in meeting the intensive, long-term monitoring needs of many NCD disease patient groups. In addition, existing portable devices with rigid electronics are still limited in clinical use due to unreliable data, limited functionality, and lack of continuous measurement ability. Here, a wearable system for at-home cardiovascular monitoring of postpartum women—a group with urgently unmet NCD needs in the United States—using a cloud-integrated soft sternal device with conformal nanomembrane sensors is introduced. A supporting mobile application provides device data to a custom cloud architecture for real-time waveform analytics, including medical device-grade blood pressure prediction via deep learning, and shares the results with both patient and clinician to complete a robust and highly scalable remote monitoring ecosystem. Validated in a month-long clinical study with 20 postpartum Black women, the system demonstrates its ability to remotely monitor existing disease progression, stratify patient risk, and augment clinical decision-making by informing interventions for groups whose healthcare needs otherwise remain unmet in standard clinical practice. © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - Stoke is a leading cause of long-term disability, including upper-limb hemiparesis. Frequent, unobtrusive assessment of naturalistic motor performance could enable clinicians to better assess rehabilitation effectiveness and monitor patients' recovery trajectories. We therefore propose and validate a two-phase data analytic pipeline to estimate upper-limb impairment based on the naturalistic performance of activities of daily living (ADLs). Eighteen stroke survivors were equipped with an inertial sensor on the stroke-affected wrist and performed up to four ADLs in a naturalistic manner. Continuous inertial time series were segmented into sliding windows, and a machine-learned model identified windows containing instances of point-to-point (P2P) movements. Using kinematic features extracted from the detected windows, a subsequent model was used to estimate upper-limb motor impairment, as measured by the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA). Both models were evaluated using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. The P2P movement detection model had an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.72. FMA estimates had a normalized root mean square error of 18.8% with R2=0.72. These promising results support the potential to develop seamless, ecologically valid measures of real-world motor performance.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Background: Continuous assessment and remote monitoring of cognitive function in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) enables tracking therapeutic effects and modifying treatment to achieve better clinical outcomes. While standardized neuropsychological tests are inconvenient for this purpose, wearable sensor technology collecting physiological and behavioral data looks promising to provide proxy measures of cognitive function. The objective of this study was to evaluate the predictive ability of digital physiological features, based on sensor data from wrist-worn wearables, in determining neuropsychological test scores in individuals with MCI. Methods: We used the dataset collected from a 10-week single-arm clinical trial in older adults (50–70 years old) diagnosed with amnestic MCI (N = 30) who received a digitally delivered multidomain therapeutic intervention. Cognitive performance was assessed before and after the intervention using the Neuropsychological Test Battery (NTB) from which composite scores were calculated (executive function, processing speed, immediate memory, delayed memory and global cognition). The Empatica E4, a wrist-wearable medical-grade device, was used to collect physiological data including blood volume pulse, electrodermal activity, and skin temperature. We processed sensors’ data and extracted a range of physiological features. We used interpolated NTB scores for 10-day intervals to test predictability of scores over short periods and to leverage the maximum of wearable data available. In addition, we used individually centered data which represents deviations from personal baselines. Supervised machine learning was used to train models predicting NTB scores from digital physiological features and demographics. Performance was evaluated using “leave-one-subject-out” and “leave-one-interval-out” cross-validation. Results: The final sample included 96 aggregated data intervals from 17 individuals. In total, 106 digital physiological features were extracted. We found that physiological features, especially measures of heart rate variability, correlated most strongly to the executive function compared to other cognitive composites. The model predicted the actual executive function scores with correlation r = 0.69 and intra-individual changes in executive function scores with r = 0.61. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrated that wearable-based physiological measures, primarily HRV, have potential to be used for the continuous assessments of cognitive function in individuals with MCI. © 2024, The Author(s).

AB  - Breathable and stretchable conductive materials are ideal for healthcare wearable electronic devices. However, the tradeoff between the sensitivity and detection range of electronic sensors and the challenge posed by simple-functional electronics limits their development. Here, inspired by the bionic-leaf vein conductive path, silver nanowires (AgNWs)-Ti3C2Tx (MXene) hybrid structure assembled on the nonwoven fabrics (NWF) is well sandwiched between porous polyborosiloxane elastomer (PBSE) to construct the multifunctional breathable wearable electronics with both high anti-impact performance and good sensing behavior. Benefiting from the high conductive AgNWs-MXene hybrid structure, the NWF/AgNWs-MXene/PBSE nanocomposite exhibits high sensitivity (GF = 1158.1), wide monitoring range (57 %), controllable thermal management properties, and excellent electromagnetic interference shielding effect (SET = 41.46 dB). Moreover, owing to the wonderful shear stiffening effect of PBSE, the NWF/AgNWs-MXene/PBSE possesses a high energy absorption performance. Combining with deep learning, this breathable electronic device can be further applied to wireless sensing gloves and multifunctional medical belts, which will drive the development of electronic skin, human-machine interaction, and personalized healthcare monitoring applications. © 2024

AB  - Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. COVID-19 become an active epidemic disease due to its spread around the globe. The main causes of the spread are through interaction and transmission of the droplets through coughing and sneezing. The spread can be minimized by isolating the susceptible patients. However, it necessitates remote monitoring to check the breathing issues of the patient remotely to minimize the interactions for spread minimization. Thus, in this article, we offer a wearable-IoTs-centered framework for remote monitoring and recognition of the breathing pattern and abnormal breath detection for timely providing the proper oxygen level required. We propose wearable sensors accelerometer and gyroscope-based breathing time-series data acquisition, temporal features extraction, and machine learning algorithms for pattern detection and abnormality identification. The sensors provide the data through Bluetooth and receive it at the server for further processing and recognition. We collect the six breathing patterns from the twenty subjects and each pattern is recorded for about five minutes. We match prediction accuracies of all machine learning models under study (i.e. Random forest, Gradient boosting tree, Decision tree, and K-nearest neighbor. Our results show that normal breathing and Bradypnea are the most correctly recognized breathing patterns. However, in some cases, algorithm recognizes kussmaul well also.

AB  - Background: Fatal coronary heart disease (FCHD) is often described as sudden cardiac death (affects >4 million people/year), where coronary artery disease is the only identified condition. Electrocardiographic artificial intelligence (ECG-AI) models for FCHD risk prediction using ECG data from wearable devices could enable wider screening/monitoring efforts. Objectives: To develop a single-lead ECG–based deep learning model for FCHD risk prediction and assess concordance between clinical and Apple Watch ECGs. Methods: An FCHD single-lead (“lead I” from 12-lead ECGs) ECG-AI model was developed using 167,662 ECGs (50,132 patients) from the University of Tennessee Health Sciences Center. Eighty percent of the data (5-fold cross-validation) was used for training and 20% as a holdout. Cox proportional hazards (CPH) models incorporating ECG-AI predictions with age, sex, and race were also developed. The models were tested on paired clinical single-lead and Apple Watch ECGs from 243 St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study participants. The correlation and concordance of the predictions were assessed using Pearson correlation (R), Spearman correlation (ρ), and Cohen's kappa. Results: The ECG-AI and CPH models resulted in AUC = 0.76 and 0.79, respectively, on the 20% holdout and AUC = 0.85 and 0.87 on the Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist external validation data. There was moderate-strong positive correlation between predictions (R = 0.74, ρ = 0.67, and κ = 0.58) when tested on the 243 paired ECGs. The clinical (lead I) and Apple Watch predictions led to the same low/high-risk FCHD classification for 99% of the participants. CPH prediction correlation resulted in an R = 0.81, ρ = 0.76, and κ = 0.78. Conclusion: Risk of FCHD can be predicted from single-lead ECGs obtained from wearable devices and are statistically concordant with lead I of a 12-lead ECG. © 2024 Heart Rhythm Society

AB  - Human activity recognition (HAR) involves the prediction of movement type of a human, based on raw data being captured from wearable sensors or vision based sensors. HAR systems have sapped great interest over the period of time due to its wide applications in the field of healthcare, surveillance and also in the coming generation of metaverse. This article proposes an artificial intelligence (AI) based system using hybrid deep learning model to recognise various human activities from the video footages. The deep convolutional layers and recurrent neural network (RNN) have been combined to generate the hybrid deep learning model known as convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN). The deep convolutional layers of deep convolutional neural network Inception V3 Net have been used to extract the feature values from the video frames corresponding to each human activity and each generated feature vector has been classified to the appropriate activity class by the gated recurrent unit (GRU) variant of RNN classifier. The performance of the proposed HAR system has been evaluated on the three widely used public datasets—KTH, UCF101, and UCF sports action dataset. GRU variant of RNN classifier is capable to store and remember a long temporal sequence of video frames, generating the pattern of any human activity, over a long duration and so experimental results exhibit that the proposed hybrid deep learning based HAR system outperforms the state-of-the-art methods available in this research domain. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.

AB  - The function of IOT-AI-based healthcare monitoring in a pandemic event is crucial. Even when a doctor is not present at the patient’s workplace, it helps in the prevention of disease transmission and the identification of diseases. In this study, a smart phone and an electronic wearable gadget are shown in a Wi-Fi connection. In an IOT-AI-based healthcare system, sensors are utilized to monitor physiological statistics of patient including heart rate, temperature, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation. In our proposed system, patient statistics is gathered and kept in a cloud server while health parameters are continually monitored. This is done over Wi-Fi at a remote location. GNN (Graph Neural Network)-based statistical analysis is carried out on patient statistics for monitoring health records. To track patient healthcare, sensors (or inputs) are linked to an ARDUINO Uno microcontroller, and the findings are recorded on a cloud server. If the patient encounters any irregularities, a smart phone alert will automatically send the patient’s location and a message to medical professionals. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Medical Internet of Things (MIoT) is becoming increasingly mainstream as their applications continue to grow. These applications include remote healthcare monitoring, drug storage, alarm systems, and medical wearable devices. Remote patient monitoring, especially using wearable devices, has improved the health and protection of numerous people, while avoiding unnecessary hospital visits. Ideally, healthcare monitoring systems should accurately and timely detect if the patient is entering a critical condition, and alert the concerned doctor accordingly. However, in practice, there are two kinds of alarms raised by such systems, namely, events and anomalies. Events are non-erroneous data that do not conform to the expected values, indicating abnormality in the patient's condition. On the other hand, anomalies are erroneous data that may result from faulty sensors, electromagnetic interference, malicious attacks, or hardware tampering. These anomalies lead to false alarms which affect the decision making process and may cause danger to the patient's life. Traditionally, wearable MIoTs, measuring different vitals, frequently communicate with the patient's phone, or a local processing unit (LPU), in order to analyze and process the collected data. However, the increase in processing capabilities of IoT devices has made on-device event detection possible. This adds an extra layer of defense while avoiding unnecessary communication with LPU. In this paper, a healthcare monitoring system is proposed which compromises of two layers - (1) an online lightweight approach, based on multivariate long-short term memory (LSTM) autoencoder, embedded in each MIoT, that is able to detect data abnormality and alarms the LPU, (2) a correlation technique, at the LPU, that differentiates between anomalies and events, and alerts the patient's doctor only in case of an event. Since a single sensor reading does not provide enough clinical insight to detect the full length of an event, a feature engineering approach is implemented to extract interpretable statistical, dynamic and physiological features that provide the clinical insight needed. The proposed approach is simulated using Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) dataset for various vital signs, such as heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure. It is compared with four benchmarks, where the results show the robustness of the model in differentiating between anomalies and events, with event detection sensitivity and specificity above 93%. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea is a common type of sleep-disordered breathing associated with multiple comorbidities. Nearly a billion people are estimated to have obstructive sleep apnea, which carries a substantial economic burden, but under-diagnosis is still a problem. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the first-line treatment for OSAS. Telemedicine-based interventions (TM) have been evaluated to improve access to diagnosis, increase CPAP adherence, and contribute to easing the follow-up process, allowing healthcare facilities to provide patient-centered care. This narrative review summarizes the evidence available regarding the potential future of telemedicine in the management pathway of OSA. The potential of home sleep studies to improve OSA diagnosis and the importance of remote monitoring for tracking treatment adherence and failure and to contribute to developing patient engagement tools will be presented. Further studies are needed to explore the impact of shifting from teleconsultations to collaborative care models where patients are placed at the center of their care. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Pre-eclampsia (PET) is a hypertensive disease that occurs during pregnancy or in the postpartum period. It complicates 2% to 8% of all pregnancies and is one of the causes of more than 50,000 maternal deaths and over 500,000 fetal deaths worldwide annually. Adverse birth outcomes due to pregnancy complications have been associated with three delays: delay in recognizing the complication, delay in reaching an appropriate facility, and delay in receiving adequate care when the facility is reached. Thus prevention, timely detection, and care of pregnancy complications can prevent maternal deaths and morbidity. The Internet of Things (IoT) and machine learning (ML) technologies have become the new revolution of research in the field of healthcare. These technologies can be utilized to interconnect various sensors, monitor the health status of a patient, and predict the occurrence of an ailment. This study has designed and prototyped a pre-eclampsia monitoring model based on IoT and machine learning for remotely monitoring the health status of an expectant woman and her unborn child, to enhance early diagnosis of pre-eclampsia and improve birth outcomes. The study involved researching the on most appropriate biosensors and then designing and prototyping the pre-eclampsia watch. To build the pre-eclampsia prediction model the best ML algorithm was empirically analysed. A Naïve Bayes pre-eclampsia prediction model was found to perform better in identifying pregnant women who are at risk of pre-eclampsia after evaluation of various pre-eclampsia models built using decision trees, Naïve Bayes, K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM) and Artificial neural networks (ANN). Lastly, the predictive model was integrated with the pre-eclampsia model to assist in early diagnosis of pre-eclampsia. The prototype generates alerts when the expectant woman is at risk of Pre-eclampsia. The pre-eclampsia watch model can securely capture and transmit expectant women's vital to the cloud for processing and provide timely alerts when the woman is at risk. Further research on the performance and efficacy of the model in a real environment will be done by experimenting with it in a purposively selected sample. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Arrhythmia disorders are the leading cause of death worldwide and are primarily recognized by the patient's irregular cardiac rhythms. Wearable Internet of Things (IoT) devices can reliably measure patients' heart rhythms by producing electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Due to their non-invasive nature, ECG signals have been frequently employed to detect arrhythmias. The manual procedure, however, takes a long time and is prone to error. Utilizing deep learning models for early automatic identification of cardiac arrhythmias is a preferable approach that will improve diagnosis and therapy. Though ECG analysis using cloud-based methods can perform satisfactorily, they still suffer from security issues. It is essential to provide secure data transmission and storage for IoT medical data because of its significant development in the healthcare system. So, this paper proposes a secure arrhythmia classification system with the help of effective encryption and a deep learning (DL) system. The proposed method mainly involved two phases: ECG signal transmission and arrhythmia disease classification. In the ECG signal transmission phase, the patient's ECG data collected through the IoT sensors is encrypted using the optimal key-based elgamal elliptic curve cryptography (OKEGECC) mechanism, and the encrypted data is securely transmitted to the cloud. After that, in the arrhythmia disease classification phase, the system collects the data from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology-Beth Israel Hospital (MIT-BIH) database to perform training. The collected data is preprocessed by applying the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to improve the quality of the ECG data. Next, the feature extraction is carried out by deformable attention-centered residual network 50 (DARNet-50), and finally, the classification is performed using butterfly-optimized Bi-directional long short-term memory (BOBLSTM). The experimental outcomes showed that the proposed system achieves 99.76% accuracy, which is better than the existing related schemes.  © 2024 - IOS Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT)-based Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) systems provide real-time data and insights about patients' conditions without the need for constant physical visits to healthcare facilities. The wearable sensors are responsible for sensing the psychological vitals of humans at different intervals to detect their precise health status. This article introduces an Interfering Input Classification Model (IICM) for addressing the continuous and discrete data extraction issues in RPM. The proposed model hybridizes whale optimization and deep-Q-learning for classification and connectivity identification between different interval data. The sensed information is segregated as discrete and continuous using the search process termination of the whales. Such classified data is validated for the maximum discreteness and its interconnection between the previous sequences. This interconnection is performed using Q-learning based on different state changes through continuous clinical range correlations. The proposed model exemplifies continuous and discrete signals (data) for abnormality detection and diagnosis recommendation. Thus the proposed model is reliable in improving the classification ratio and accuracy with fewer errors. The experimental values of the proposed model are as follows: IICM enhances classification by 6.65%, signal identification by 6.63%, and classification accuracy by 10.08%. This model reduces classification time by 9.51% and error by 10.14% for different ranges of inputs. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In recent decades, telemedicine has revolutionized the healthcare landscape, offering innovative solutions to improve the accessibility and efficiency of medical care. In this context, the Internet of Things (IoT) has played a significant role, facilitating connectivity and data exchange between medical devices and healthcare providers. However, while traditional IoT primarily focuses on local connectivity, the evolution towards the Internet of Remote Medical Things (IoRMT) has opened new frontiers in telemedicine, enabling the monitoring and treatment of patients even in remote or hard-to-reach areas. IoRMT represents an integrated approach that leverages advanced communication and sensing technologies to enable the connection and interaction of remote medical devices with healthcare networks. This interconnected infrastructure allows healthcare professionals to monitor patients in real-time, diagnose medical conditions, and provide personalized care, regardless of their geographical location. Through the adoption of wearable sensors, remote monitoring devices, and teleassistance systems, IoRMT offers a wide range of applications in telemedicine. One of the key areas where IoRMT has demonstrated its potential is in the management of chronic diseases. Patients suffering from conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, or heart disease can benefit from regular monitoring and real-time feedback from their healthcare providers, enabling more effective and proactive management of their health conditions. Additionally, IoRMT facilitates the delivery of specialized care in remote areas where access to healthcare services is limited. However, the implementation of IoRMT in telemedicine presents significant challenges, including data security, patient privacy, and the quality of network connections in remote areas. It is crucial to address these challenges through the implementation of advanced security protocols, compliance with data privacy regulations, and optimization of communication infrastructures. In conclusion, the Internet of Remote Medical Things represents a significant evolution in telemedicine, offering innovative solutions to improve the accessibility, efficiency, and quality of remote medical care. Through the integration of advanced technologies and clinical practices, IoRMT has the potential to radically transform the way healthcare is delivered and received worldwide, contributing to the improvement of health and well-being in global communities. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Human activity recognition (HAR) technology enables continuous behavior monitoring, which is particularly valuable in healthcare. This study investigates the viability of using an ear-worn motion sensor for classifying daily activities, including lying, sitting/standing, walking, ascending stairs, descending stairs, and running. Fifty healthy participants (between 20 and 47 years old) engaged in these activities while under monitoring. Various machine learning algorithms, ranging from interpretable shallow models to state-of-the-art deep learning approaches designed for HAR (i.e., DeepConvLSTM and ConvTransformer), were employed for classification. The results demonstrate the ear sensor’s efficacy, with deep learning models achieving a 98% accuracy rate of classification. The obtained classification models are agnostic regarding which ear the sensor is worn and robust against moderate variations in sensor orientation (e.g., due to differences in auricle anatomy), meaning no initial calibration of the sensor orientation is required. The study underscores the ear’s efficacy as a suitable site for monitoring human daily activity and suggests its potential for combining HAR with in-ear vital sign monitoring. This approach offers a practical method for comprehensive health monitoring by integrating sensors in a single anatomical location. This integration facilitates individualized health assessments, with potential applications in tele-monitoring, personalized health insights, and optimizing athletic training regimes. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Pursuing high-performance conductive hydrogels is still hot topic in development of advanced flexible wearable devices. Herein, a tough, self-healing, adhesive double network (DN) conductive hydrogel (named as OSA-(Gelatin/PAM)-Ca, O-(G/P)-Ca) was prepared by bridging gelatin and polyacrylamide network with functionalized polysaccharide (oxidized sodium alginate, OSA) through Schiff base reaction. Thanks to the presence of multiple interactions (Schiff base bond, hydrogen bond, and metal coordination) within the network, the prepared hydrogel showed outstanding mechanical properties (tensile strain of 2800 % and stress of 630 kPa), high conductivity (0.72 S/m), repeatable adhesion performance and excellent self-healing ability (83.6 %/79.0 % of the original tensile strain/stress after self-healing). Moreover, the hydrogel-based sensor exhibited high strain sensitivity (GF = 3.66) and fast response time (<0.5 s), which can be used to monitor a wide range of human physiological signals. Based on this, excellent compression sensitivity (GF = 0.41 kPa−1 in the range of 90–120 kPa), a three-dimensional (3D) array of flexible sensor was designed to monitor the intensity of pressure and spatial force distribution. In addition, a gel-based wearable sensor was accurately classified and recognized ten types of gestures, achieving an accuracy rate of >96.33 % both before and after self-healing under three machine learning models (the decision tree, SVM, and KNN). This paper provides a simple method to prepare tough and self-healing conductive hydrogel as flexible multifunctional sensor devices for versatile applications in fields such as healthcare monitoring, human-computer interaction, and artificial intelligence. © 2024

AB  - The use of observed wearable sensor data (e.g., photoplethysmograms [PPG]) to infer health measures (e.g., glucose level or blood pressure) is a very active area of research. Such technology can have a significant impact on health screening, chronic disease management and remote monitoring. A common approach is to collect sensor data and corresponding labels from a clinical grade device (e.g., blood pressure cuff) and train deep learning models to map one to the other. Although well intentioned, this approach often ignores a principled analysis of whether the input sensor data have enough information to predict the desired metric. We analyze the task of predicting blood pressure from PPG pulse wave analysis. Our review of the prior work reveals that many papers fall prey to data leakage and unrealistic constraints on the task and preprocessing steps. We propose a set of tools to help determine if the input signal in question (e.g., PPG) is indeed a good predictor of the desired label (e.g., blood pressure). Using our proposed tools, we found that blood pressure prediction using PPG has a high multi-valued mapping factor of 33.2% and low mutual information of 9.8%. In comparison, heart rate prediction using PPG, a well-established task, has a very low multi-valued mapping factor of 0.75% and high mutual information of 87.7%. We argue that these results provide a more realistic representation of the current progress toward the goal of wearable blood pressure measurement via PPG pulse wave analysis.

AB  - Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) can be leveraged for periodic sensing and recording of different health parameters using sensors, wireless communications, and computation platforms. Health care systems can be enhanced by using IoMT for remote patient monitoring and data-driven diagnosis powered by machine learning algorithms. In the context of IoMT, federated learning (FL) is an excellent choice to manage machine learning (ML) algorithms to drive this analysis. This is because FL models can be trained in a distributed manner on local heterogeneous datasets that all contribute to the "collective wisdom". The model parameters can be regulated and shared without sharing the actual health data, ensuring confidentiality and security. This paper makes a case for the viability of FL-based analysis of data acquired via IoMT by presenting some use cases and recent work in this area and proposing a novel framework for data analysis using FL specifically in the context of mental stress detection. It shows that FL-based methods can significantly reduce the required communication overhead for each local device from 10.02MB/day up to only 754B/day as compared to non-FL techniques. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.

AB  - The novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) is caused by the newly identified strain of the coronavirus family severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), whose target organ is the lungs. It has become a global pandemic, and COVID-19 poses so far unprecedented challenges to healthcare systems around the globe, particularly to those with weakened immune systems. Effective methods for managing, diagnosing, and lessening the effects of COVID-19 are critical because, by 2024, the virus has already caused over 7 million deaths. In this study, we anatomize the impacts of the latest COVID-19 virus on patients with the help of computational intelligence, like Machine learning, artificial intelligence, and IoT-enabled technologies for managing, analyzing, diagnosing, and predicting COVID-19. With tools for early identification, risk assessment, and therapy optimization, machine learning and artificial intelligence have shown tremendous promise in the healthcare industry. These tools can examine big datasets to find patterns and trends that might not be noticeable to human observers.

AB  - Rheumatologic diseases are marked by their complexity, involving immune-, metabolic- and mechanically mediated processes which can affect different organ systems. Despite a growing arsenal of targeted medications, many rheumatology patients fail to achieve full remission. Assessing disease activity remains challenging, as patients prioritize different symptoms and disease phenotypes vary. This is also reflected in clinical trials where the efficacy of drugs is not necessarily measured in an optimal way with the traditional outcome assessment. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has catalyzed a digital transformation in healthcare, embracing telemonitoring and patient-reported data via apps and wearables. As a further driver of digital medicine, electronic medical record (EMR) providers are actively engaged in developing algorithms for clinical decision support, heralding a shift towards patient-centered, decentralized care. Machine learning algorithms have emerged as valuable tools for handling the increasing volume of patient data, promising to enhance treatment quality and patient well-being. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are particularly promising for radiological image analysis, aiding in the detection of specific lesions such as erosions, sacroiliitis, or osteoarthritis, with several FDA-approved applications. Clinical predictions, including numerical disease activity forecasts and medication choices, offer the potential to optimize treatment strategies. Numeric predictions can be integrated into clinical workflows, allowing for shared decision making with patients. Clustering patients based on disease characteristics provides a personalized care approach. Digital biomarkers, such as patient-reported outcomes and wearables data, offer insights into disease progression and therapy response more flexibly and outside patient consultations. In association with patient-reported outcomes, disease-specific digital biomarkers via image recognition or single-camera motion capture enables more efficient remote patient monitoring. Digital biomarkers may also play a major role in clinical trials in the future as continuous, disease-specific outcome measurement facilitating decentralized studies. Prediction models can help with patient selection in clinical trials, such as by predicting high disease activity. Efforts are underway to integrate these advancements into clinical workflows using digital pathways and remote patient monitoring platforms. In summary, machine learning, digital biomarkers, and advanced imaging technologies hold immense promise for enhancing clinical decision support and clinical trials in rheumatology. Effective integration will require a multidisciplinary approach and continued validation through prospective studies. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Remote patient monitoring aspect of Healthcare 4.0 has revolutionized the way we pursue medical treatment. Integration of Medical Internet of Things (MIoT), patient centric healthcare devices and remote robotic equipment has vanished the separative line between physical onsite monitoring and remote monitoring. Secure use of available network to handle this critical patient data is one of the major concern raised due to this methodology. To mitigate this paramount concern Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can be utilized to detect in malicious activity or manipulation occurred on incoming data. Though use of ML algorithms along with conventional feature extraction technique brings performance saturation challenge and creates a black-box in this highly complex communication environment. To overcome this drawback, we propose X-NET, an eXplainable Artificial Intelligent (X-AI) based network data security approach for Healthcare 4.0 applications. For comparison purpose we have used five different types of tradition feature extraction techniques along with Naive Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (LR) and Perception. Utilization of X-AI algorithms such as LIME and SHAP has significantly boosted the overall performance and reliability of X-NET. Performance evolution of our proposed approach has been done through various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, Receiver Operating Characteristic and Precision-Recall Trade-off. Thus, X-NET contributes in defining secured, reliable and robust remote patient monitoring scheme for Healthcare 4.0. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Smart medical devices and the internet of things (IoT) have enhanced healthcare systems by allowing remote monitoring of patient's health. Because of the unexpected increase in the number of diabetes patients, it is critical to regularly evaluate patients' health conditions before any significant illness occurs. As a result of transmitting a large volume of sensitive medical data, dealing with IoT data security issues remains a difficult challenge. This paper presents a secure remote diabetes monitoring (SR-DM) model that uses hybrid encryption, combining the advanced encryption standard and elliptic curve cryptography (AES-ECC), to ensure the patients' sensitive data is protected in IoT platforms based on the cloud. The health statuses of patients are determined in this model by predicting critical situations using machine learning (ML) algorithms for analyzing medical data sensed by smart health IoT devices. The results reveal that the AES-ECC approach has a significant influence on cloud-based IoT systems and the random forest (RF) classification method outperforms with a high accuracy of 91.4%. As a consequence of the outcomes obtained, the proposed model effectively establishes a secure and efficient system for remote health monitoring. © 2024 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

AB  - Apart from providing user-friendly applications that support digitized healthcare routines, the use of wearable devices has proven to increase the independence of patients in a healthcare setting. By applying machine learning techniques to real health-related data, important conclusions can be drawn for unsolved issues related to disease prognosis. In this paper, various machine learning techniques are examined and analyzed for the provision of personalized care to COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms based on individual characteristics and the comorbidities they have, while the connection between the stimuli and predictive results are utilized for the evaluation of the system’s transparency. The results, jointly analyzing wearable and electronic health record data for the prediction of a daily dyspnea grade and the duration of fever, are promising in terms of evaluation metrics even in a specified stratum of patients. The interpretability scheme provides useful insight concerning factors that greatly influenced the results. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the use of wearable devices for remote monitoring through cloud platforms is feasible while providing awareness of a patient’s condition, leading to the early detection of undesired changes and reduced visits for patient screening. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - In several nations, the majority of heart attacks lead to fatality prior to patients receiving any kind of medical intervention. The traditional healthcare system is mostly passive, requiring patients to initiate contact with healthcare services independently. People often do not request the treatment if they are unconscious during a heart disease episode. The use of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) methods offers significant advantages in addressing the issue of caring for patients with cardiac problems. These techniques may transform service delivery into ubiquitous and activate healthcare services. Low-cost remote monitoring systems are essential to implementing a widespread healthcare service. In this article, we proposed a cost-effective Personal Health Care Device(PHCD) based on the Internet of Things (IoT). The PHCD transmits user somatic signals to data acquisition devices using a LoRa (Long-range and low-power) wireless communication network. The received data is uploaded to the cloud using IoT platforms like Adafruit IO. Further, various Machine learning (ML) algorithms, Naïve Bayes, ANN, CNN, and LSTM, were applied to collected data to predict heart rate and SpO2 behavior. The performance results of different forecast models were compared to identify precise modeling and reliable forecasts to prevent emergency cardiovascular conditions. © 2024, Innovative Information Science and Technology Research Group.

AB  - Introduction: Telemonitoring improves clinical outcomes in patients with arterial hypertension (AH) and type 2 diabetes (T2D), however, cost structure analyses are lacking. This study seeks to explore the cost structure of telemonitoring for the elderly with AH and T2D in primary care and identify factors influencing costs for potential future expansions. Methods: Infrastructure, operational, patient participation, and out-of-pocket costs were determined using a bottom-up approach. Infrastructure costs were determined by dividing equipment and telemonitoring platform expenses by the number of participants. Operational and patient participation costs were determined by considering patient training time, data measurement/review time, and teleconsultation time. The change in out-of-pocket costs was assessed in both groups using a structured questionnaire and 12-month expenditure data. Statistical analysis employed an unpaired sample t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, and chi-square test. Results: A total of 117 patients aged 71.4±4.7 years were included in the study. The telemonitoring intervention incurred an annual infrastructure costs of €489.4 and operational costs of €97.3 (95% CI 85.7-109.0) per patient. Patient annual participation costs were €215.6 (95% CI 190.9-241.1). Average annual out-of-pocket costs for both groups were €345 (95% CI 221-469). After 12 months the telemonitoring group reported significantly lower out-of-pocket costs (€132 vs. €545, p<0.001), driven by reduced spending on food, dietary supplements, medical equipment, and specialist check-ups compared to the standard care group. Conclusion: To optimise the cost structure of telemonitoring, strategies like shortening the telemonitoring period, developing a national telemonitoring platform, using patient devices, integrating artificial intelligence into platforms, and involving nurse practitioners as telemedicine centre coordinators should be explored. © National Institute of Public Health, Slovenia.

AB  - Categorizing Artificial Intelligence of Medical Things (AIoMT) devices within the realm of standard Internet of Things (IoT) and Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices, particularly at the server and computational layers, poses a formidable challenge. In this paper, we present a novel methodology for categorizing AIoMT devices through the application of decentralized processing, referred to as "Federated Learning" (FL). Our approach involves deploying a system on standard IoT devices and labeled IoMT devices for training purposes and attribute extraction. Through this process, we extract and map the interconnected attributes from a global federated cum aggression server. The aim of this terminology is to extract interdependent devices via federated learning, ensuring data privacy and adherence to operational policies. Consequently, a global training dataset repository is coordinated to establish a centralized indexing and synchronization knowledge repository. The categorization process employs generic labels for devices transmitting medical data through regular communication channels. We evaluate our proposed methodology across a variety of IoT, IoMT, and AIoMT devices, demonstrating effective classification and labeling. Our technique yields a reliable categorization index for facilitating efficient access and optimization of medical devices within global servers. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - In the age of data science, voice data can be treated as one of the crucial assets used for strengthening biometrics technologies and biomedical applications. However, voice biometrics is still at emergence state facing voice variability, cross-linguistic variations, and voice spoofing challenges. These long-standing issues are proposed to be solved by deploying an organic, flexible, and printed piezoelectric polymeric interface exhibiting several unique features such as strong directionality, stability over a large operating temperature range (30–90 ˚C), broad frequency (6 kHz), ultra sensitivity (5.77 V Pa−1) and high signal-to-noise ratio (38–55 dB). By analyzing speech processing parameters acquired by the voice sensor, an individual voiceprint is established, which is further utilized to train a neural network model for deploying artificial intelligence (AI)-driven voice biometrics, resulting in a remarkable accuracy of >96% for population identification and speaker recognition and >93% for healthcare assessment. Featuring a versatile printing fabrication process, innovative voiceprint approach, and a robust neural network, the programmable polymeric acoustic interface proposes a promising complementary tool to the existing biometrics technologies and plays a vital role in healthcare monitoring. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - The goal of this research is to create an ensemble deep learning model for Internet of Things (IoT) applications that specifically target remote patient monitoring (RPM) by integrating long short-term memory (LSTM) networks and convolutional neural networks (CNN). The work tackles important RPM concerns such early health issue diagnosis and accurate real-time physiological data collection and analysis using wearable IoT devices. By assessing important health factors like heart rate, blood pressure, pulse, temperature, activity level, weight management, respiration rate, medication adherence, sleep patterns, and oxygen levels, the suggested Remote Patient Monitor Model (RPMM) attains a noteworthy accuracy of 97.23%. The model's capacity to identify spatial and temporal relationships in health data is improved by novel techniques such as the use of CNN for spatial analysis and feature extraction and LSTM for temporal sequence modeling. Early intervention is made easier by this synergistic approach, which enhances trend identification and anomaly detection in vital signs. A variety of datasets are used to validate the model's robustness, highlighting its efficacy in remote patient care. This study shows how using ensemble models' advantages might improve health monitoring's precision and promptness, which would eventually benefit patients and ease the burden on healthcare systems. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Patients with advanced heart failure, due to the instability of their clinical conditions, need close surveillance to avoid dangerous exacerbations or sudden events. Digital technology can be of great help in this contest, thanks to remote monitoring, made possible with the use of wearable or implantable instruments. The latter are currently generally inserted inside defibrillators or resynchronization systems, or inserted inside the pulmonary circulation for monitoring pulmonary pressure. Parameters such as thoracic impedance, physical activity, heart rate variability, atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, blood pressure, and O2 saturation can be controlled remotely. The data relating to the actual benefit in terms of avoidable events (death and hospitalizations) are not definitive, but certainly from an organizational point of view, the benefit is evident, both on the part of the patient and of the organization of care. The latter, provided in the form of televisits, requires a re-modulation of the system, making use of trained personnel, a well- structured network, and digital technologies (platforms, electronic health records) that are not yet perfectly developed. The evolution of the solutions offered by artificial intelligence guarantees a rapid and progressive refinement of telemedicine in this sector.  © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study used electrocardiogram data in conjunction with artificial intelligence methods as a noninvasive tool for detecting peripartum cardiomyopathy. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the efficacy of an artificial intelligence-based heart failure detection model for peripartum cardiomyopathy detection. STUDY DESIGN: We first built a deep-learning model for heart failure detection using retrospective data at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center. Cases were adult and nonpregnant female patients with a heart failure diagnosis; controls were adult nonpregnant female patients without heart failure. The model was then tested on an independent cohort of pregnant women at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center with or without peripartum cardiomyopathy. We also tested the model in an external cohort of pregnant women at Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist. Key outcomes were assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. We also repeated our analysis using only lead I electrocardiogram as an input to assess the feasibility of remote monitoring via wearables that can capture single-lead electrocardiogram data. RESULTS: The University of Tennessee Health Science Center heart failure cohort comprised 346,339 electrocardiograms from 142,601 patients. In this cohort, 60% of participants were Black and 37% were White, with an average age (standard deviation) of 53 (19) years. The heart failure detection model achieved an area under the curve of 0.92 on the holdout set. We then tested the ability of the heart failure model to detect peripartum cardiomyopathy in an independent University of Tennessee Health Science Center cohort of pregnant women and an external Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist cohort of pregnant women. The independent University of Tennessee Health Science Center cohort included 158 electrocardiograms from 115 patients; our deep-learning model achieved an area under the curve of 0.83 (0.77–0.89) for this data set. The external Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist cohort involved 80 electrocardiograms from 43 patients; our deep-learning model achieved an area under the curve of 0.94 (0.91–0.98) for this data set. For identifying peripartum cardiomyopathy diagnosed ≥10 days after delivery, the model achieved an area under the curve of 0.88 (0.81–0.94) for the University of Tennessee Health Science Center cohort and of 0.96 (0.93–0.99) for the Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist cohort. When we repeated our analysis by building a heart failure detection model using only lead-I electrocardiograms, we obtained similarly high detection accuracies, with areas under the curve of 0.73 and 0.93 for the University of Tennessee Health Science Center and Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist cohorts, respectively. CONCLUSION: Artificial intelligence can accurately detect peripartum cardiomyopathy from electrocardiograms alone. A simple electrocardiographic artificial intelligence–based peripartum screening could result in a timelier diagnosis. Given that results with 1-lead electrocardiogram data were similar to those obtained using all 12 leads, future studies will focus on remote screening for peripartum cardiomyopathy using smartwatches that can capture single-lead electrocardiogram data. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Innovative research works in the healthcare sector keep on advancing every day. As the “Internet of Things (IoT)” keeps on evolving, the application of IoT in the medical field is prominent these days. Utilizing IoT devices, alert messages can be sent directly to medical professionals in case of an emergency. So, monitoring the health condition of an individual using IoT technology has become a popular and beneficial method in today's contemporary medical field. With the help of mobile IoT medical equipment, the technology of smart Healthcare Monitoring System (HMS) is proliferating. By utilizing deep learning and IoT technology, the medical diagnosis system has evolved from direct face-to-face visits to the hospital to remote telemedicine method. Most of the data generated by the IoT wearable sensors are highly correlated and may consist of outliers. The extraction of the essential attributes from these data is a complicated task. So, “deep learning and machine learning” techniques are adapted to determine the most relevant and appropriate feature required for efficient diagnosis from the unstructured data produced by the IoT devices and thus help in minimizing the redundancy of unnecessary data. Fusing deep learning methods with healthcare IoT made only the essential details to be available for diagnosis. Therefore, a deep learning-oriented IoT-based HMS is executed in this work. With the support of several wearable healthcare devices, the required data are acquired. The encryption of the data acquired from standard sources using Optimal Key-based Advanced Encryption Standard (OK-AES) is carried out next to assure the security of the sensitive medical data. The keys for AES encryption are optimally chosen with the aid of the Enhanced Heap-Based Optimizer Algorithm (EHBOA). The encrypted data is transferred to the “cloud platform” for data storage. Once there is a need for the data, then the encrypted data is initially downloaded from the cloud platform. Then using the same AES scheme, the decryption of the data to attain the original data is carried out. From the retrieved data, the extraction of the crucial attributes is carried out. The extracted features are chosen in an optimized manner and are concatenated with the tuned weights to form the weighted feature matrix. This formulated weighted feature matrix is provided as input to the “Adaptive Dilated Transformer Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) with Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (ADTBi-LSTM-GRU) model.” The variables in the ADTBG are optimized using the EHBOA for providing an accurate classification outcome. The classified disease outcome is obtained from the deployed ADTBi-LSTM-GRU model. Simulations are done to verify the efficiency and reliability of the implemented deep learning and IoT-based HMS. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - In recent years, healthcare monitoring systems (HMS) have increasingly integrated the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) with cloud computing, leading to challenges related to data latency and efficient processing. This paper addresses these issues by introducing a Machine Learning-based Medical Data Segmentation (ML-MDS) approach that employs a k-fold random forest technique for efficient health data classification and latency reduction in a fog-cloud environment. Our method significantly improves latency issues, enhancing the Quality of Service (QoS) in healthcare systems and demonstrating its adaptability in heterogeneous network scenarios. We specifically employ the Random Forest algorithm to mitigate the common problem of overfitting in machine learning models, ensuring broader applicability across various healthcare contexts. Additionally, by optimizing data processing in fog computing layers, we achieve a substantial reduction in overall latency between healthcare sensors and cloud servers. This improvement is evidenced through a comparative performance analysis with existing models. The proposed framework not only ensures secure and scalable management of IoMT health data but also incorporates a stochastic approach to mathematically formulate performance indicators for the HMS queuing model. This model effectively predicts system response times and assesses the computing resources required under varying workload conditions. Our simulation results show a classification accuracy of 92%, a 56% reduction in latency compared to existing models, and an overall enhancement in e-healthcare service quality. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - Maternal mortality due to pregnancy complications remains a significant global challenge, necessitating the development of innovative approaches to safeguard pregnant women from potential threats. This paper introduces Maatran, a technological solution that leverages IoT, Cloud technologies, and Machine Learning solutions to address maternal health issues. Maatran utilizes Arduino-based wearable sensor devices to remotely collect health data, which is then transmitted to an Android app interface for data processing and storage in the cloud. A Random Forest model is employed to accurately predict maternal health risks. The system’s features provide a holistic solution for remote health monitoring of pregnant women and facilitate direct communication with healthcare professionals. Through rigorous machine learning model training, Maatran achieved accuracy, ROC-AUC, and log loss of 0.93, 0.91, and 0.93 respectively, surpassing existing state-of-the-art models. The implementation of Maatran demonstrates its potential to significantly improve maternal health outcomes by enabling early risk detection and timely interventions.

AB  - Medical Internet of Things technology can effectively enable remote physiological data collection, monitoring, and transmission by integrating flexible sensors, wireless communication, and the human body in a wearable and embedded manner. Herein, a stretchable elastomer optical fiber has been developed and sandwiched with two performance of polymethyl methacrylate optical fibers to form a fully flexible polymer optical fiber sensor. The optical fiber integrated with the system mainly consists of a microcomputer, a light-emitting diode (LED) driver, a LED light source, a photodiode, and a Bluetooth module. One intelligent wearable photonic sensing system has been developed based on the Beer-Lambert law of the stretchable elastomer optical fiber for remote healthcare monitoring. Benefiting from the use of elastomer polymer materials, the sensing system features a maximum strain of more than 250%, a high-tensile strain of up to 100%, and a durability of >500 tests. Also, based on the advantage of elastomer optical fiber, the sensing part can be flexibly pasted on the skin surface as a wearable device for real-time monitoring of multiple physiological parameters. In this study, we successfully realized the monitoring of breathing pattern, heart rate, pulse, facial micro-activity, and joint activity, and the recognition of articulatory activity and knee joint activity using a 1-D convolutional neural network, with an accuracy of more than 90% for each activity recognition. Such merits demonstrate its potential as a medical toolkit and indicate promise for remote healthcare monitoring.  © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Millions of individuals globally suffer with diabetes mellitus, a prevalent chronic illness that requires prompt and correct diagnosis for successful management and the avoidance of complica-tions. In real-time scenarios, such as remote healthcare monitoring and emergency situations, rapid and precise diabetes diagnosis becomes paramount. This research introduces an innovative approach to enhance diabetes diagnosis in real-time by leveraging Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs) and data mining techniques. The proposed system harnesses the capabilities of MANETs to establish dynamic and ad hoc communication networks among medical devices, wearable sensors, and health-care professionals’ mobile devices. These networks facilitate the seamless exchange of patient data, including glucose levels, insulin records, and vital signs, enabling timely and continuous monitoring of diabetes patients regardless of their geographical location. Data mining techniques, specifically machine learning algorithms, are employed to analyse the vast amounts of patient data collected through the MANET. The system uses these algorithms to extract valuable insights, patterns, and trends from the data, thus assisting in the real-time diagnosis and personalised management of diabetes. Machine learning models are trained to predict glucose fluctuations, identify potential hyperglycemic or hypoglycemic events, and offer treatment recommendations based on historical and real-time data. To validate the system’s efficacy, extensive simulations and real-world trials were conducted across a diverse group of diabetes patients. The results demonstrate significant im-provements in early diagnosis accuracy, prediction of critical events, and individualised treatment strategies, leading to enhanced patient outcomes and reduced healthcare costs. The system’s ability to provide timely interventions and empower healthcare providers with data-driven insights holds promise for revolutionising diabetes care, particularly in remote or resource-constrained settings. © 2024, Scibulcom Ltd..

We utilized five machine-learning algorithms to enhance the accuracy of triage. Results: The RTOF approach has remarkable efficacy in a simulated telemedicine environment, with a triage accuracy rate of 98%. The Random Forest algorithm exhibited superior performance compared to the other approaches under scrutiny. The performance characteristics attained were an accuracy rate of 98%, a precision rate of 99%, a sensitivity rate of 98%, and a specificity rate of 100%. The findings show a significant improvement compared to the present triage methods. Conclusions: The efficiency of RTOF surpasses that of existing triage frameworks, showcasing its significant ability to enhance the quality and efficacy of telemedicine solutions. This work showcases substantial enhancements compared to existing triage approaches, while also providing a scalable approach to tackle hospital congestion and optimize resource allocation in real-time. The results of our study emphasize the capacity of RTOF to mitigate hospital overcrowding, expedite medical intervention, and enable the creation of adaptable telemedicine networks. This study highlights potential avenues for further investigation into the integration of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) with machine learning to develop cutting-edge medical technologies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Despite the existence of evidence-based rehabilitation strategies that address biomechanical deficits, the persistence of recurrent ankle problems in 70% of patients with acute ankle sprains highlights the unresolved nature of this issue. Artificial intelligence (AI) emerges as a promising tool to identify definitive predictors for ankle sprains. This paper aims to summarize the use of AI in investigating the ankle biomechanics of healthy and subjects with ankle sprains. Methods: Articles published between 2010 and 2023 were searched from five electronic databases. 59 papers were included for analysis with regards to: i). types of motion tested (functional vs. purposeful ankle movement); ii) types of biomechanical parameters measured (kinetic vs kinematic); iii) types of sensor systems used (lab-based vs field-based); and, iv) AI techniques used. Findings: Most studies (83.1%) examined biomechanics during functional motion. Single kinematic parameter, specifically ankle range of motion, could obtain accuracy up to 100% in identifying injury status. Wearable sensor exhibited high reliability for use in both laboratory and on-field/clinical settings. AI algorithms primarily utilized electromyography and joint angle information as input data. Support vector machine was the most used supervised learning algorithm (18.64%), while artificial neural network demonstrated the highest accuracy in eight studies. Interpretations: The potential for remote patient monitoring is evident with the adoption of field-based devices. Nevertheless, AI-based sensors are underutilized in detecting ankle motions at risk of sprain. We identify three key challenges: sensor designs, the controllability of AI models, and the integration of AI-sensor models, providing valuable insights for future research. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The management of heart failure has undergone significant evolution, advancing from the initial utilization of digitalis and diuretics to the contemporary practice of personalized medicine and sophisticated device therapy. Despite these advancements, the persistent challenge of high hospitalization and readmission rates underscores an urgent need for innovative solutions. This manuscript explores how the integration of digital health technologies into interventional cardiology marks a paradigm shift in the management of heart failure. These technologies are no longer mere adjuncts but have become foundational to a modern approach, providing tools for continuous monitoring, patient education, and improved outcomes post-intervention.

AB  - As Canada’s population of older adults rises, the need for aging-in-place solutions is growing due to the declining quality of long-term-care homes and long wait times. While the current standards include questionnaire-based assessments for monitoring activities of daily living (ADLs), there is an urgent need for advanced indoor localization technologies that ensure privacy. This study explores the use of Ultra-Wideband (UWB) technology for activity recognition in a mock condo in the Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital. UWB systems with built-in Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors were tested, using anchors set up across the condo and a tag worn by patients. We tested various UWB setups, changed the number of anchors, and varied the tag placement (on the wrist or chest). Wrist-worn tags consistently outperformed chest-worn tags, and the nine-anchor configuration yielded the highest accuracy. Machine learning models were developed to classify activities based on UWB and IMU data. Models that included positional data significantly outperformed those that did not. The Random Forest model with a 4 s data window achieved an accuracy of 94%, compared to 79.2% when positional data were excluded. These findings demonstrate that incorporating positional data with IMU sensors is a promising method for effective remote patient monitoring. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Wearable electroencephalography devices emerge as a cost-effective and ergonomic alternative to gold-standard polysomnography, paving the way for better health monitoring and sleep disorder screening. Machine learning allows to automate sleep stage classification, but trust and reliability issues have hampered its adoption in clinical applications. Estimating uncertainty is a crucial factor in enhancing reliability by identifying regions of heightened and diminished confidence. In this study, we used an uncertainty-centred machine learning pipeline, U-PASS, to automate sleep staging in a challenging real-world dataset of single-channel electroencephalography and accelerometry collected with a wearable device from an elderly population. We were able to effectively limit the uncertainty of our machine learning model and to reliably inform clinical experts of which predictions were uncertain to improve the machine learning model's reliability. This increased the five-stage sleep-scoring accuracy of a state-of-the-art machine learning model from 63.9% to 71.2% on our dataset. Remarkably, the machine learning approach outperformed the human expert in interpreting these wearable data. Manual review by sleep specialists, without specific training for sleep staging on wearable electroencephalography, proved ineffective. The clinical utility of this automated remote monitoring system was also demonstrated, establishing a strong correlation between the predicted sleep parameters and the reference polysomnography parameters, and reproducing known correlations with the apnea–hypopnea index. In essence, this work presents a promising avenue to revolutionize remote patient care through the power of machine learning by the use of an automated data-processing pipeline enhanced with uncertainty estimation. © 2024 European Sleep Research Society.

AB  - Background. Globally, heart failure is a leading health problem, with an estimated 64 million cases worldwide, including 6.7 million in the U.S., according to estimates. The U.S. economic burden is expected to see a steep rise by the year 2030. Heart failure is a cause of 8.5% of heart disease-related deaths and a central cardiovascular killer. Emergency hospitalization rates and readmission rates are high. Methods: A systematic methodology was followed to generate authentic and reliable data on remote monitoring in the setting of heart failure patients. The inclusion criteria comprise articles describing remote monitoring interventions published in peer-reviewed journals and carried out in human subjects in English. Critical analysis applies quality assessment tools to assess methodological soundness, possible bias, and relevance to the research objective. Results: This review discusses wearable devices, e.g., Zoll HFMS ReDS, and Audicor, each effectively monitoring cardiac parameters and reducing H.F. hospitalizations. Implantable cardiac monitors such as LUX-Dx and CardioMEMS H.F. RM has potential to give real-time data for timely intervention and tailored therapies. The integration of machine learning algorithms in devices, for example VitalPatch and the SimpleSense has led to increased use of these devices to make precise and efficient health care predictions, leading to improved patient outcomes. Conclusion: From all the research, remote monitoring devices and strategies are recommendable for patients with various cardiac complications. It can improve heart function, however, R.M. has not been seen to reduce the overall mortality rate among heart patients. © 2024, Sapienza Grupo Editorial. All rights reserved.

AB  - Starting from the escalating global burden of mental health disorders, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, the article examines the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to revolutionize mental health care. With nearly one in five adults facing mental health issues and suicide ranking as a leading cause of death among the young, the strained mental health system seeks innovative solutions. The text discusses the rapid evolution of AI, particularly in image analysis for early physical health diagnoses, and its promising applications in mental health, including predictive analytics for various disorders. AI’s ability to analyze written language, speech characteristics, and physiological signals from wearables offers avenues for remote monitoring and early prognosis. Despite the need to address ethical considerations, particularly biases in data sets and concerns about potential patient detachment, the article advocates for AI as a complementary tool rather than a replacement for human involvement in mental health services. Overall, the article emphasizes the transformative potential of AI in enhancing diagnostics, monitoring, and treatment strategies for mental health disorders. © 2024 Mary Ann Liebert Inc..

AB  - Wheezing is a critical indicator of various respiratory conditions, including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Current diagnosis relies on subjective lung auscultation by physicians. Enabling this capability via a low-profile, objective wearable device for remote patient monitoring (RPM) could offer pre-emptive, accurate respiratory data to patients. With this goal as our aim, we used a low-profile accelerometer-based wearable system that utilizes deep learning to objectively detect wheezing along with respiration rate using a single sensor. The miniature patch consists of a sensitive wideband MEMS accelerometer and low-noise CMOS interface electronics on a small board, which was then placed on nine conventional lung auscultation sites on the patient’s chest walls to capture the pulmonary-induced vibrations (PIVs). A deep learning model was developed and compared with a deterministic time–frequency method to objectively detect wheezing in the PIV signals using data captured from 52 diverse patients with respiratory diseases. The wearable accelerometer patch, paired with the deep learning model, demonstrated high fidelity in capturing and detecting respiratory wheezes and patterns across diverse and pertinent settings. It achieved accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 95%, 96%, and 93%, respectively, with an AUC of 0.99 on the test set—outperforming the deterministic time–frequency approach. Furthermore, the accelerometer patch outperforms the digital stethoscopes in sound analysis while offering immunity to ambient sounds, which not only enhances data quality and performance for computational wheeze detection by a significant margin but also provides a robust sensor solution that can quantify respiration patterns simultaneously. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - The advancement of medical technology has brought about a significant transformation in remote healthcare monitoring, which is crucial for providing customized care and ongoing observation. This is especially important when it comes to controlling long-term illnesses like high blood pressure, which raises the risk of heart disease considerably, especially in older people. This methodology achieves greater accuracy by combining regular medical monitoring and Electronic Clinical Data (ECD) from complete medical records with physical data from patients' routine medical monitoring. This innovative technique enhances the area of cardiac disease prediction. A technique that uses cutting-edge machine learning models and IoT technology to meet this demand. In particular, we use the powerful Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm to effectively examine big datasets and extract important characteristics to improve prediction accuracy. The deep learning model Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) is used to further enhance prediction skills to extract complex temporal patterns from patient data. It outperformed naive Bayes, decision trees, and random forests with our approach, achieving a greater prediction accuracy of 99.4 %. With the combination of Internet of Things technologies and sophisticated machine learning models, this paper offers a novel approach to remote healthcare monitoring. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - The recent advancements of the emerging technologies (i.e., internet of things [IoT] and machine learning [ML]) has rapidly transformed the healthcare industry in a better way. IoT-enabled wearable and monitoring devices are making new methods to manage patient's health. Sensor-enabled devices are useful for incessant data collection and remote patient monitoring. This enables the healthcare providers to impart more significant healthcare settings. Machine learning classifiers are useful in classifying different diseases and also rank the state of the disease. These two technologies potentially reduce the healthcare costs and accredit the patients to take control of their health condition and improvement. However, different challenges are associated with the implementation of these technologies in healthcare including security, data privacy and availability, proper system integration, and data transfer. This chapter aims to provide an overview of different approaches and security aspects of these emerging technologies in the advancement of remote healthcare monitoring. © 2024, IGI Global.

AB  - Stretchable sensors have been widely investigated and developed for the purpose of human motion detection, touch sensors, and healthcare monitoring, typically converting mechanical/structural deformation into electrical signals. The viscoelastic strain of stretchable materials often results in nonlinear stress−strain characteristics over a broad range of strains, consequently making the stretchable sensors at the body joints less accurate in predicting and recognizing human gestures. Accurate recognition of human gestures can be further deteriorated by environmental changes such as temperature and humidity. Here, we demonstrated an environment-adaptable high stress−strain linearity (up to ε = 150%) and high-durability (>100,000 cycles) stretchable sensor conformally laminated onto the body joints for human gesture recognition. The serpentine configuration of our ionic liquid-based stretchable film enabled us to construct broad data sets of mechanical strain and temperature changes for machine learning-based gesture recognition. Signal recognition and training of distinct strains and environmental stimuli using a machine learning-based algorithm analysis successfully measured and predicted the joint motion in a temperature-changing environment with an accuracy of 92.86% (R-squared). Therefore, we believe that our serpentine-shaped ion gel-based stretchable sensor harmonized with machine-learning analysis will be a significant achievement toward environmentally adaptive and multianalyte sensing applications. Our proposed machine learning-enabled multisensor system may enable the development of future electronic devices such as wearable electronics, soft robotics, electronic skin, and human-machine interaction systems. © 2024 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The IoT (Internet of Things) has played a promising role in e-healthcare applications during the last decade. Medical sensors record a variety of data and transmit them over the IoT network to facilitate remote patient monitoring. When a patient visits a hospital he may need to connect or disconnect medical devices from the medical healthcare system frequently. Also, multiple entities (e.g., doctors, medical staff, etc.) need access to patient data and require distinct sets of patient data. As a result of the dynamic nature of medical devices, medical users require frequent access to data, which raises complex security concerns. Granting access to a whole set of data creates privacy issues. Also, each of these medical user need to grant access rights to a specific set of medical data, which is quite a tedious task. In order to provide role-based access to medical users, this study proposes a blockchain-based framework for authenticating multiple entities based on the trust domain to reduce the administrative burden. This study is further validated by simulation on the infura blockchain using solidity and Python. The results demonstrate that role-based authorization and multi-entities authentication have been implemented and the owner of medical data can control access rights at any time and grant medical users easy access to a set of data in a healthcare system. The system has minimal latency compared to existing blockchain systems that lack multi-entity authentication and role-based authorization. © 2024 Aslam et al.

AB  - Remote monitoring and artificial intelligence will become common and intertwined in anesthesiology by 2050. In the intraoperative period, technology will lead to the development of integrated monitoring systems that will integrate multiple data streams and allow anesthesiologists to track patients more effectively. This will free up anesthesiologists to focus on more complex tasks, such as managing risk and making value-based decisions. This will also enable the continued integration of remote monitoring and control towers having profound effects on coverage and practice models. In the PACU and ICU, the technology will lead to the development of early warning systems that can identify patients who are at risk of complications, enabling early interventions and more proactive care. The integration of augmented reality will allow for better integration of diverse types of data and better decision-making. Postoperatively, the proliferation of wearable devices that can monitor patient vital signs and track their progress will allow patients to be discharged from the hospital sooner and receive care at home. This will require increased use of telemedicine, which will allow patients to consult with doctors remotely. All of these advances will require changes to legal and regulatory frameworks that will enable new workflows that are different from those familiar to today's providers. © 2024 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

AB  - This article presents a novel hardware-assisted distributed ledger-based solution for simultaneous device and data security in smart healthcare. This article presents a novel architecture that integrates PUF, blockchain, and Tangle for Security-by-Design (SbD) of healthcare cyber–physical systems (H-CPSs). Healthcare systems around the world have undergone massive technological transformation and have seen growing adoption with the advancement of Internet-of-Medical Things (IoMT). The technological transformation of healthcare systems to telemedicine, e-health, connected health, and remote health is being made possible with the sophisticated integration of IoMT with machine learning, big data, artificial intelligence (AI), and other technologies. As healthcare systems are becoming more accessible and advanced, security and privacy have become pivotal for the smooth integration and functioning of various systems in H-CPSs. In this work, we present a novel approach that integrates PUF with IOTA Tangle and blockchain and works by storing the PUF keys of a patient’s Body Area Network (BAN) inside blockchain to access, store, and share globally. Each patient has a network of smart wearables and a gateway to obtain the physiological sensor data securely. To facilitate communication among various stakeholders in healthcare systems, IOTA Tangle’s Masked Authentication Messaging (MAM) communication protocol has been used, which securely enables patients to communicate, share, and store data on Tangle. The MAM channel works in the restricted mode in the proposed architecture, which can be accessed using the patient’s gateway PUF key. Furthermore, the successful verification of PUF enables patients to securely send and share physiological sensor data from various wearable and implantable medical devices embedded with PUF. Finally, healthcare system entities like physicians, hospital admin networks, and remote monitoring systems can securely establish communication with patients using MAM and retrieve the patient’s BAN PUF keys from the blockchain securely. Our experimental analysis shows that the proposed approach successfully integrates three security primitives, PUF, blockchain, and Tangle, providing decentralized access control and security in H-CPS with minimal energy requirements, data storage, and response time. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - MXenes are a class of two-dimensional (2D) materials that have gained significant attention in the field of electronic skins (E-skins). MXene-based composites offer several advantages for E-skins, including high electrical conductivity, mechanical flexibility, transparency, and chemical stability. Their mechanical flexibility allows for conformal integration onto various surfaces, enabling the creation of E-skins that can closely mimic human skin. In addition, their high surface area facilitates enhanced sensitivity and responsiveness to external stimuli, making them ideal for sensing applications. Notably, MXene-based composites can be integrated into E-skins to create sensors that can detect various stimuli, such as temperature, pressure, strain, and humidity. These sensors can be used for a wide range of applications, including health monitoring, robotics, and human-machine interfaces. However, challenges related to scalability, integration, and biocompatibility need to be addressed. One important challenge is achieving long-term stability under harsh conditions such as high humidity. MXenes are susceptible to oxidation, which can degrade their electrical and mechanical properties over time. Another crucial challenge is the scalability of MXene synthesis, as large-scale production methods need to be developed to meet the demand for commercial applications. Notably, the integration of MXenes with other components, such as energy storage devices or flexible electronics, requires further developments to ensure compatibility and optimize overall performance. By addressing issues related to material stability, mechanical flexibility, scalability, sensing performance, and power supply, MXene-based E-skins can develop the fields of healthcare monitoring/diagnostics, prosthetics, motion monitoring, wearable electronics, and human-robot interactions. The integration of MXenes with emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence or internet of things, can unlock new functionalities and applications for E-skins, ranging from healthcare monitoring to virtual reality interfaces. This review aims to examine the challenges, advantages, and limitations of MXenes and their composites in E-skins, while also exploring the future prospects and potential advancements in this field. © 2024 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) usage has increased due to advancements in information and communication systems. IoT technologies in contemporary healthcare applications connect doctors and patients for automated and knowledgeable everyday activity monitoring for older adults and older adults. The use of wearable body sensors and mobile devices to track personal health care is becoming more widespread. Wearable sensor technology is one of the key IoT advancements in healthcare tracking systems. IoT integration in healthcare has also sparked the development of intelligent apps like smart healthcare and sophisticated healthcare monitoring systems. Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has received a lot of interest from pervasive computing researchers working on smart healthcare systems. Patients with heart disease, obesity, and diabetes must engage in regular physical activity as part of their therapy plan. Some people with mental illnesses must monitor their everyday physical activity to avoid unfavorable conditions. As a result, identifying and keeping track of physical human activity can help a health professional evaluate a patient’s behavior in terms of their health. HAR system must, therefore, be made accessible to end users to protect their health. Over the past few decades, much work has gone into developing a strong and reliable framework for action recognition and prediction. In this chapter, we discuss the trends and challenges of machine learning-based HAR systems and offer solutions for them. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Healthcare Internet of Things (IoT) initiatives that aim to integrate technology and medicine are shaking the sector to its foundations. The revolutionary potential of the proposed strategy is shown here as we investigate the far-reaching consequences of the Healthcare IoT on remote patient monitoring. The beginning sets the stage by underlining the significance of bridging the gap between technology and medicine. Our multi-pronged approach comprises Internet of Things (IoT) remote monitoring, cloud-based analysis, artificial intelligence (AI) integrated diagnostics, real-time alerts, and predictive analytics. Our study's results demonstrate that the proposed approach is superior to the status quo. The area of remote patient monitoring has profited considerably from the employment of traditional approaches, such as the fusion of data from wearable sensors, analysis in the cloud, diagnostics that utilize artificial intelligence, real-time monitoring, predictive modeling, and smart alarm systems. The suggested strategy, however, performs very well across all of the most important measures of assessment. Comparatively, the accuracy rate of the conventional wearable sensor fusion approach was only 76%, whereas our suggested method reached 89%. Our strategy was also more accurate than the standard approach (88% vs. 73%). When compared to the recall rate of 68% produced by conventional methods, our suggested strategy significantly outperformed the competition. It's a great option for hospitals and clinics since it improves diagnostic precision and speed without breaking the bank. © 2024, American Scientific Publishing Group (ASPG). All rights reserved.

AB  - Remote patient monitoring has recently been popularised due to advanced technological innovations. The advent of the Sixth Generation Internet of Things (6G-IoT) communication technology, combined with deep learning algorithms, presents a groundbreaking opportunity for enhancing remote cardiac system monitoring. This paper proposes an innovative framework leveraging the ultra-reliable, low-latency communication capabilities of 6G-IoT to transmit real-time cardiac data from wearable devices directly to healthcare providers. Integrating deep learning models facilitates the accurate analysis and prediction of cardiac anomalies, significantly improving traditional monitoring systems. Our methodology involves the deployment of cutting-edge wearable sensors capable of capturing high-fidelity cardiac signals. These signals are transmitted via 6G-IoT networks, ensuring minimal delay and maximum reliability. Upon receiving the data, a densely connected deep neural network with an optimised swish activation function—designed explicitly for cardiac anomaly detection is employed to analyse the data in real-time. These algorithms are trained on vast datasets to recognise patterns indicative of potential cardiac issues, allowing immediate intervention when necessary. The proposed system’s efficacy is validated through extensive testing in simulated environments, demonstrating its ability to accurately detect and swiftly predict a wide range of cardiac conditions. Moreover, implementing 6G-IoT communication ensures the system's scalability and adaptability to future technological advancements. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - Cardiometabolic diseases (CMDs) are the major types of non-communicable diseases, contributing to huge disease burdens in the Western Pacific region (WPR). The use of digital health (dHealth) technologies, such as wearable gadgets, mobile apps, and artificial intelligence (AI), facilitates interventions for CMDs prevention and treatment. Currently, most studies on dHealth and CMDs in WPR were conducted in a few high- and middle-income countries like Australia, China, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and New Zealand. Evidence indicated that dHealth services promoted early prevention by behavior interventions, and AI-based innovation brought automated diagnosis and clinical decision-support. dHealth brought facilitators for the doctor-patient interplay in the effectiveness, experience, and communication skills during healthcare services, with rapidly development during the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019. In the future, the improvement of dHealth services in WPR needs to gain more policy support, enhance technology innovation and privacy protection, and perform cost-effectiveness research. © 2023

AB  - The remote monitoring of vital signs and healthcare provision has become an urgent necessity due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the world. Blood oxygen level, heart rate, and body temperature data are crucial for managing the disease and ensuring timely medical care. This study proposes a low-cost wearable device employing non-contact sensors to monitor, process, and visualize critical variables, focusing on body temperature measurement as a key health indicator. The wearable device developed offers a non-invasive and continuous method to gather wrist and forehead temperature data. However, since there is a discrepancy between wrist and actual forehead temperature, this study incorporates statistical methods and machine learning to estimate the core forehead temperature from the wrist. This research collects 2130 samples from 30 volunteers, and both the statistical least squares method and machine learning via linear regression are applied to analyze these data. It is observed that all models achieve a significant fit, but the third-degree polynomial model stands out in both approaches. It achieves an R2 value of 0.9769 in the statistical analysis and 0.9791 in machine learning. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - The possibility of remotely monitoring and managing chronic diseases is made feasible by the Internet of Things (IoT), which enables the collection and analysis of vast amounts of data from various sources such as sensors, devices, and wearables. However, conventional machine learning approaches often encounter difficulties when dealing with IoT data due to its noise, heterogeneity, and high dimensions. In this study, we introduce a novel technique for developing human-centric intelligent systems for remote monitoring of chronic diseases using deep learning in an IoT context. This technique is capable of handling complex and diverse IoT data, providing accurate and comprehensible predictions and recommendations. We outline a standardized architecture for these systems, comprising of three distinct phases: data acquisition, data processing, and data visualization. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology, we apply it to a case study involving the development and evaluation of a human-centered intelligent system for remote monitoring of hypertension and diabetic patients, involving real users. Our findings reveal a substantial enhancement in prediction accuracy when employing our proposed hybrid algorithm. When compared to traditional algorithms, our proposed hybrid algorithm exhibits superior performance, achieving an accuracy of 93.5%, surpassing the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) with an accuracy of 88.2%, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks at 90.4%, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) at 91.6%. This improvement in accuracy is critical for ensuring reliable disease monitoring and management, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach. In terms of precision, scalability, and user satisfaction, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. Furthermore, we address the social and ethical implications inherent in our methodology and suggest avenues for future research in this domain. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The surge in popularity of wireless headphones, particularly wireless earbuds, as smart wearables, has been notable in recent years. These devices, empowered by artificial intelligence (AI), are broadening their utility in areas such as speech recognition, augmented reality, pose recognition, and health care monitoring, thereby enriching user experiences through novel interactive interfaces driven by embedded sensors. However, the widespread adoption of wireless earbuds has spurred concerns regarding security and privacy, necessitating robust bespoke security measures. Despite the miniaturization of mobile chips enabling the integration of sophisticated algorithms into smart wearables, the research and industrial communities have yet to accord adequate attention to earbud security. This article focuses on empowering wireless earbuds to authenticate their legitimate users, tackling the challenges associated with conventional authentication methods. Instead of relying on input interface authentication methods like PIN or lock patterns, this research delves into leveraging inertial measurement unit (IMU) data collected during interactions with devices to extract novel biometric features, presenting an alternative approach that nonetheless confronts challenges related to signal capture and interference. Consequently, we propose and design BudsAuth, an implicit user authentication framework that harnesses built-in IMU sensors in smart earbuds to capture vibration signals induced by on-face touching interactions with the earbuds. These vibrations are utilized to deliver continuous and implicit user authentication with high precision and compatibility across various earbud models. Extensive evaluation demonstrates BudsAuth's capability to achieve an equal error rate (EER) of 0.0003, representing an approximate 99.97% accuracy with seven consecutive samples of interactive gestures for implicit authentication.  © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Satellite-based positioning is among the useful functionalities provided by wearable devices. In active and assisted living, positioning information from wearable devices may be exploited to support subjects affected by cognitive impairments, but it suffers from a limited measurement accuracy. This paper presents a method based on Machine Learning (ML) for positioning classification. Differently from other ML algorithms, the method here proposed leverages the measurement error committed by wearable devices in acquiring coordinates of geographical positions. Then, the tests are performed on three commercial smartwatches, in two near outdoor positions with different conditions of non-optimal signal reception. The proposed method generally exhibits notable performance, reaching on average a classification accuracy of 91.97%. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Objective: Sleep monitoring has extensively utilized electroencephalogram (EEG) data collected from the scalp, yielding very large data repositories and well-trained analysis models. Yet, this wealth of data is lacking for emerging, less intrusive modalities, such as ear-EEG.Methods and procedures: The current study seeks to harness the abundance of open-source scalp EEG datasets by applying models pre-trained on data, either directly or with minimal fine-tuning; this is achieved in the context of effective sleep analysis from ear-EEG data that was recorded using a single in-ear electrode, referenced to the ipsilateral mastoid, and developed in-house as described in our previous work. Unlike previous studies, our research uniquely focuses on an older cohort (17 subjects aged 65-83, mean age 71.8 years, some with health conditions), and employs LightGBM for transfer learning, diverging from previous deep learning approaches. Results: Results show that the initial accuracy of the pre-trained model on ear-EEG was 70.1%, but fine-tuning the model with ear-EEG data improved its classification accuracy to 73.7%. The fine-tuned model exhibited a statistically significant improvement (p < 0.05, dependent t-test) for 10 out of the 13 participants, as reflected by an enhanced average Cohen's kappa score (a statistical measure of inter-rater agreement for categorical items) of 0.639, indicating a stronger agreement between automated and expert classifications of sleep stages. Comparative SHAP value analysis revealed a shift in feature importance for the N3 sleep stage, underscoring the effectiveness of the fine-tuning process.Conclusion: Our findings underscore the potential of fine-tuning pre-trained scalp EEG models on ear-EEG data to enhance classification accuracy, particularly within an older population and using feature-based methods for transfer learning. This approach presents a promising avenue for ear-EEG analysis in sleep studies, offering new insights into the applicability of transfer learning across different populations and computational techniques.Clinical impact: An enhanced ear-EEG method could be pivotal in remote monitoring settings, allowing for continuous, non-invasive sleep quality assessment in elderly patients with conditions like dementia or sleep apnea.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has emerged as a paradigm shift in healthcare, integrating the Internet of Things (IoT) with medical devices, sensors, and healthcare systems. From peripheral devices that monitor vital signs to remote patient monitoring systems and smart hospitals, IoMT provides a vast array of applications that empower healthcare professionals. However, the integration of IoMT presents numerous obstacles, such as data security, privacy concerns, interoperability, scalability, and ethical considerations. For the successful integration and deployment of IoMT, addressing these obstacles is essential. Federated Learning (FL) permits collaborative model training while maintaining data privacy in distributed environments like IoMT. By incorporating Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, the resulting models become more interpretable and transparent, enabling healthcare professionals to comprehend the underlying decision-making processes. This integration not only improves the credibility of Artificial Intelligence models but also facilitates the detection of biases, errors, and peculiar patterns in the data. The combination of FL and XAI contributes to the development of more privacy-preserving, trustworthy, and explainable AI systems, which are essential for the development of dependable and ethically sound IoMT applications. Hence, the aim of this paper is to conduct a literature review on the amalgamation of FL and XAI for IoMT. © 2024 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - “Digital Hypertension” is a new research field proposed by the Japanese Society of Hypertension that integrates digital technology into hypertension management and proactively promotes research activities. This novel approach includes the development of new technologies for better BP management, such as sensors for detecting environmental factors that affect BP, information processing, and machine learning. To facilitate “Digital Hypertension,” a more sophisticated BP monitoring system capable of measuring an individual’s BP more frequently in various situations would be required. With the use of these technologies, hypertension management could shift from the current “dots” management based on office BP readings during clinic visits to a “line” management system based on seamless home BP or individual BP data taken by a wearable BP monitoring device.

AB  - Introduction: Distinguishing Parkinson's disease (PD) from Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) at early disease stages is important for clinical trial enrollment and clinical care/prognostication. Methods: We recruited 21 participants with PSP(n = 11) or PD(n = 10) with reliable caregivers. Standardized passage reading, counting, and sustained phonation were recorded on the BioDigit Home tablet (BioSensics LLC, Newton, MA USA), and speech features from the assessments were analyzed using the BioDigit Speech platform (BioSensics LLC, Newton, MA USA). An independent t-test was performed to compare each speech feature between PSP and PD participants. We also performed Spearman's correlations to evaluate associations between speech measures and clinical scores (e.g., PSP rating scales and MoCA). In addition, the model's performance in classifying PSP and PD was evaluated using Rainbow passage reading analysis. Results: During Rainbow passage reading, PSP participants had a significantly slower articulation rate (2.45(0.49) vs 3.60(0.47) words/minute), lower speech-to-pause ratio (2.33(1.08) vs 3.67(1.18)), intelligibility dynamic time warping (DTW, 0.26(0.19) vs 0.53(0.26)), and similarity DTW (0.43(0.27) vs 0.67(0.13)) compared to PD participants. PSP participants also had longer pause times (17.24(5.47) vs 8.45(3.13) sec) and longer total signal times (52.44(6.67) vs (36.67(6.73) sec) when reading the passage. In terms of the phonation ‘a’, PSP participants showed a significant higher spectral entropy, spectral centroid, and spectral spread compared to PD participants and no differences were found for phonation ‘e’. PD participants had more accurate reverse number counts than PSP participants (14.89(3.86) vs 7.36(4.67)). PSP Rating Scale (PSPRS) dysarthria (r = 0.79, p = 0.004) and bulbar item scores (r = 0.803, p = 0.005) were positively correlated with articulation rate in reverse number counts. Correct reverse number counts were positively correlated with total Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores (r = 0.703, p = 0.016). Machine learning models using passage reading-derived measures obtained an AUC of 0.93, and the sensitivity/specificity in correctly classifying PSP and PD participants were 0.95 and 0.90, respectively. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates the feasibility of differentiating PSP from PD using a digital health technology platform. Further multi-center studies are needed to expand and validate our initial findings. © 2023

AB  - Soft and stretchable electronics have garnered significant attention in various fields, such as wearable electronics, electronic skins, and soft robotics. However, current wearable electronics made from materials like conductive elastomers, hydrogels, and liquid metals face limitations, including low permeability, poor adhesion, inadequate conductivity, and limited stretchability. These issues hinder their effectiveness in long-term healthcare monitoring and exercise monitoring. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel design of web-droplet-like electronics featuring a semi-liquid metal coating for wearable applications. This innovative design offers high permeability, excellent stretchability, strong adhesion, and good conductivity for the electronic skin. The unique structure, inspired by the architecture of a spider web, significantly enhances air permeability compared to commercial breathable patches. Furthermore, the distribution of polyborosiloxane mimics the adhesive properties of spider web mucus, while the use of semi-liquid metals in this design results in remarkable conductivity (9 × 106 S/m) and tensile performance (up to 850% strain). This advanced electronic skin technology enables long-term monitoring of various physiological parameters and supports machine learning recognition functions with unparalleled advantages. This web-droplet structure design strategy holds great promise for commercial applications in medical health monitoring and disease diagnosis. © 2024 Science China Press

AB  - Core body temperature (CBT) is a key vital sign and fever is an important indicator of disease. In the past decade, there has been growing interest for vital sign monitoring technology that may be embedded in wearable devices, and the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for remote patient monitoring systems. While wrist-worn sensors allow continuous assessment of heart rate and oxygen saturation, reliable measurement of CBT at the wrist remains challenging. In this study, CBT was measured continuously in a free-living setting using a novel technology worn at the wrist and compared to reference core body temperature measurements, i.e., CBT values acquired with an ingestible temperature-sensing pill. Fifty individuals who received the COVID-19 booster vaccination were included. The datasets of 33 individuals were used to develop the CBT prediction algorithm, and the algorithm was then validated on the datasets of 17 participants. Mean observation time was 26.4 h and CBT > 38.0 °C occurred in 66% of the participants. CBT predicted by the wrist-worn sensor showed good correlation to the reference CBT (r = 0.72). Bland–Altman statistics showed an average bias of 0.11 °C of CBT predicted by the wrist-worn device compared to reference CBT, and limits of agreement were − 0.67 to + 0.93 °C, which is comparable to the bias and limits of agreement of commonly used tympanic membrane thermometers. The small size of the components needed for this technology would allow its integration into a variety of wearable monitoring systems assessing other vital signs and at the same time allowing maximal freedom of movement to the user. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Healthcare highly depends on accessing, processing, analyzing, sharing, and storing electronic data. Cloud computing has evolved in various healthcare fields, such as bioinformatics, health management systems, and telemedicine. The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), a subset of IoT, is an essential element of a healthcare management system. The expeditious development in IoMT, intelligent medical devices, healthcare applications, and high-speed networks has enabled medical systems to efficiently diagnose, treat, manage diseases, and remotely monitor and improve the Quality of Service (QoS). To achieve this high data, high speed network, longer battery life and reliable connectivity are basic requirements. 5G conformed these needs with its numerous and distinct potential. However, the shortcomings of these medical devices in the IoMT are privacy concerns and direct physical threats. We propose a new algorithm to enhance the QoS of the IoMT devices/systems. Initially, the dataset is collected and the 5G network is operationalized. We propose a Dynamic Step-wise Tiny Encryption Algorithm with Fruit Fly Optimization Algorithm to encrypt data. Encrypted data is transmitted using the Energy Efficient Routing Protocol. When the user requests to access the data, the data is decrypted. We show that the proposed system has higher QoS attributes and is more effective. Our experimental results show that our proposed solution considerably improves QoS and network performance in terms of lifetime, communication overhead, storage footprint, and power consumption compared to the competing methods. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - The increasing pressure on the NHS has accelerated the digital transformation of healthcare technology by building smart hospitals as net zero carbon buildings with more sustainable and energy-efficient operation of structures. This has reinforced the need for technology enablement to support large scale transformation and models to adapt rapidly to support real-time remote monitoring and predictive control of healthcare estates such as compressed medical gas systems (CMGSs), where the combinations of reliability, energy inefficiency, energy loss by leakages, air quality and plant downtime are considered as the key risks. However, due to the complexity in different NHS contexts, to reliably predict demands for optimal control and detect leaks developed over time in compressed air systems is still a challenge. To suit the needs of healthcare industry, this paper proposed a novel AI-based data-driven system to make production processes more efficient and adaptive using artificial intelligence (AI) through big data analytics over Internet of things (IoT). By developing deep wavelet neural networks (DWNNs) with structure simplified and optimised for fast learning and using tight frame Mexican hat (Gaussian) wavelets with sparsity as activation functions for better generalisation to process streaming data in time and frequency domain, the real-time AI system designed can achieve optimum performance of medical air and vacuum plants with power efficiency optimised by predictive control. Through qualitative and quantitative data analytics, the real-time deep learning allows to provide valuable insights, track everything that is relevant to operations, and predict and optimise system performance. Experimental results demonstrate that optimal operations of CMGSs can thus be achieved by the real-time AI, where remotely collected data communication, processing and analytics are provided by the designed controller, communicator and distributed cloud, such that by real-time deep learning, both knowledge-based and data-driven AI techniques can be applied to detect leaks, correct errors, predict demands for predictive control with best energy efficiency, maximising productivity and helping digitise the NHS. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Egocentric activity recognition, also known as first-person vision, captures human actions and activities from the perspective of a wearable camera, providing a personalized and contextualized viewpoint. This unique perspective is crucial for various real-world applications, including healthcare monitoring, sports analy-sis, augmented reality, and assistive technologies. In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of various state-of-the-art algorithms for egocentric action recognition using the recently curated dataset, 'Coer-Egovision.' This dataset captures human actions and activities from the unique perspective of a wearable camera, providing a personalized and context-aware viewpoint. Such a perspective holds significant value for real-world applications, including healthcare monitoring, sports analysis, augmented reality, and assistive technologies.The 'Coer-Egovision' dataset encompasses diverse actions, such as 'Going-Downstairs', 'Going-Upstairs', 'Texting', 'Walking' and 'Writing' allowing for a challenging benchmark to evaluate algorithms in this domain. By leveraging the wearable camera perspective, the dataset addresses the need for a more com-prehensive understanding of human interactions with the environment.Among the evaluated algorithms, the Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Network (LRCN) emerges as the top performer, achieving an impressive accuracy of 88% in effectively modeling long-term temporal dependencies. Additionally, the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) combined with Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach demonstrates robust performance with 82% accuracy, highlighting the efficacy of feature-based methods. The study also reveals promising results for the 2-Stream Approach with 3D CNN and LSTM, achieving an accuracy of 74%. Furthermore, pretrained models like VGG16 and DenseNet201 along with LSTM exhibit competitive performances with accuracies of 80% each.These results offer valuable insights into the performance of diverse algorithms on the 'Coer-Egovision' dataset, providing valuable guidance for future research in the field of egocentric action recognition.  © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Current method for monitoring patients for cancer recurrence after treatment requires patients to travel to a centralized laboratory, causing time in scheduling appointments/waiting for results, financial burden in travel costs to clinics, and invasive procedures (i.e., biopsies) leading to discomfort in patients. To improve convenience, outcomes, and enable more frequent monitoring of cancer recurrence, we propose using an implantable hydrogel sensor for remote cancer surveillance. Gold nanostars (GNS), efficient plasmonic nanomaterials, embedded in hydrogels, enhance Raman scattering signals of cancer biomarkers. A handheld Raman spectroscopy probe collects these signals, representing the unique vibrational molecular fingerprint. Toward this effort, this study demonstrates the performance of a GNS-embedded hydrogel for discriminating serum in two preclinical mouse prostate cancer models: NSG and C57BL/6J mice. GNS labeled with 4-mercaptobenzoic acid (4-MBA) were embedded in 70 µL hydrogels. Six serum samples from NSG mice (3 with LNCaP subcutaneous tumors, 3 normal) and eight serum samples from C57BL/6J mice (3 wild type, 5 transgenic modified–TRAMP with prostate cancer) were obtained. Serum (70 µL) was incubated overnight (4°C) with the hydrogel sample. Raman spectra were collected at five distinct locations using the Raman handheld probe. Spectral analysis involved intensity normalization, principal component analysis (PCA) for dimension reduction, and linear discriminate analysis (LDA) for classification with leave-one-spectra-out cross-validation. NSG mice exhibited band differences at 775-825 cm-1, 1202-1249 cm-1, and 1430-1478 cm-1 (LDA ROC AUC = 0.83), while C57BL/6J mice showed differences at 1152-1245 cm-1 and 1362-1407 cm-1 (LDA ROC AUC = 0.98). Successful discrimination of serum in mouse models demonstrates the presence of biomarkers that differentiate cancer-bearing mice and the potential for remote cancer monitoring. © 2024 SPIE.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is capable of controlling the healthcare monitoring system for remote-based patients. Epilepsy, a chronic brain syndrome characterized by recurrent, unpredictable attacks, affects individuals of all ages. IoT-based seizure monitoring can greatly enhance seizure patients' quality of life. IoT device acquires patient data and transmits it to a computer program so that doctors can examine it. Currently, doctors invest significant manual effort in inspecting Electroencephalograph (EEG) signals to identify seizure activity. However, EEG-based seizure detection algorithms face challenges in real-world scenarios due to non-stationary EEG data and variable seizure patterns among patients and recording sessions. Therefore, a sophisticated computer-based approach is necessary to analyze complex EEG records. In this work, the authors proposed a hybrid approach by combining traditional convolution neural (CN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) along with an attention mechanism for the automatic recognition of epileptic seizures through EEG signal analysis. This attention mechanism focuses on significant subsets of EEG data for class recognition, resulting in improved model performance. The proposed methods are evaluated using a publicly available UCI epileptic seizure recognition dataset, which consists of five classes: four normal conditions and one abnormal seizure condition. Experimental results demonstrate that the suggested approach achieves an overall accuracy of 97.05% for the five-class EEG recognition data, with an accuracy of 99.52% for binary classification distinguishing seizure cases from normal instances. Furthermore, the proposed intelligent seizure recognition model is compatible with an IoMT (Internet of Medical Things) cloud-based smart healthcare framework.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Cardiovascular rehabilitation is essential for illness prevention and management. A unique method for cardiovascular rehabilitation uses cloud computing and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to dynamically create personalized workout regimens. Traditional rehabilitation plans lack flexibility and are less successful. The suggested system analyses real-time physiological data and adapts workout regimens in the cloud using RNNs. Heart rate, blood pressure, and physical activity are monitored using wearable sensors. These gadgets smoothly send data to the cloud, where a powerful RNN model processes it. The RNN adapts workout suggestions to the user's physiological reactions, historical data, and health objectives. The cloud-based system, which effectively processes sizable datasets and accommodates expanding user bases, ensures scalability. Remote access to rehabilitation services allows healthcare practitioners to monitor patients and alter workout routines remotely. The personalized approach tailors therapies to each person's health profile to promote adherence and rehabilitation results. The suggested dynamic cardiovascular rehabilitation system uses cloud computing and powerful machine learning to build adaptive, personalized workout regimens, revolutionizing rehabilitation. This technique may improve cardiovascular rehabilitation plans, improving long-term health outcomes for at-risk or recovering cardiovascular disease patients. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Flexible tactile sensors are under high pursuit for wearable electronics toward healthcare monitoring, human-machine interaction, and artificial intelligence. Permeability and hydrophobicity are emerging unique properties and require significant dedication of research efforts. Herein, we develop a type of flexible, breathable, and waterproof iontronic tactile sensor based on a nonwoven fabric platform using a facile dip-drying and solution-spraying technique. The intrinsic open-ended porous structure of the fabric offers air permeability (∼224.9 mm s-1), and the stearic acid microsheets decorated on the outside of the sensor provides effective hydrophobic protection (water contact angle ∼151.9°). The designed electrode-to-electrolyte interfacing microstructures of MXene microspheres and nanosheets on the fabric electrodes and the hierarchical structures with conical secondary features of chrysanthemum pollen on the fabric electrolyte endow the sensor with a high sensitivity of 214.92 kPa-1 and a wide detection range of 0-45 kPa. Fast response time, low detection limit, good dynamic response, and excellent stability are also achieved. With the help of a home-built mechatronic sensing system, the developed fabric tactile sensor can be practically used either as sensor units for human health status monitoring and motion detection or as a sensor array for spatial pressure distribution identification of human-object interaction. © 2023 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) is considered a serious public health problem due to the uncertainty of its onset. Consuming wearable devices have increasing popularities for healthcare monitoring, and many of them are capable of continuous monitoring and early detection of CVDs. This paper proposes a framework for heart sound detection that can be considered for deployment on smart wearable devices to screen CVDs conveniently. A dual-stream convolutional neural network (DS-CNN) is developed to detect abnormal ones from short-term heart sound recordings. Preprocessing module is first employed for noise filtering and amplitude normalization. Then short-time Fourier transform and higher-order spectral are introduced for feature extraction, whose products are subsequently fed into the DS-CNN for screening abnormal heart sound signals. Two open accessible datasets are employed for performance evaluation. The results well demonstrate the classification accuracy of the proposed DS-CNN, and also indicate its advantages for adapting to heart sound recordings collected by different equipments.  © 1975-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Shoulder rehabilitation is a process that requires physical therapy sessions to recover the mobility of the affected limbs. However, these sessions are often limited by the availability and cost of specialized technicians, as well as the patient’s travel to the session locations. This paper presents a novel smartphone-based approach using a pose estimation algorithm to evaluate the quality of the movements and provide feedback, allowing patients to perform autonomous recovery sessions. This paper reviews the state of the art in wearable devices and camera-based systems for human body detection and rehabilitation support and describes the system developed, which uses MediaPipe to extract the coordinates of 33 key points on the patient’s body and compares them with reference videos made by professional physiotherapists using cosine similarity and dynamic time warping. This paper also presents a clinical study that uses QTM, an optoelectronic system for motion capture, to validate the methods used by the smartphone application. The results show that there are statistically significant differences between the three methods for different exercises, highlighting the importance of selecting an appropriate method for specific exercises. This paper discusses the implications and limitations of the findings and suggests directions for future research. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) represents a hazardous cardiac arrhythmia that significantly elevates the risk of stroke and heart failure. Despite its severity, its diagnosis largely relies on the proficiency of health care professionals. At present, the real-time identification of paroxysmal AF is hindered by the lack of automated techniques. Consequently, a highly effective machine learning algorithm specifically designed for AF detection could offer substantial clinical benefits. We hypothesized that machine learning algorithms have the potential to identify and extract features of AF with a high degree of accuracy, given the intricate and distinctive patterns present in electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings of AF. Objective: This study aims to develop a clinically valuable machine learning algorithm that can accurately detect AF and compare different leads’ performances of AF detection. Methods: We used 12-lead ECG recordings sourced from the 2020 PhysioNet Challenge data sets. The Welch method was used to extract power spectral features of the 12-lead ECGs within a frequency range of 0.083 to 24.92 Hz. Subsequently, various machine learning techniques were evaluated and optimized to classify sinus rhythm (SR) and AF based on these power spectral features. Furthermore, we compared the effects of different frequency subbands and different lead selections on machine learning performances. Results: The light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) was found to be the most effective in classifying AF and SR, achieving an average F1-score of 0.988 across all ECG leads. Among the frequency subbands, the 0.083 to 4.92 Hz range yielded the highest F1-score of 0.985. In interlead comparisons, aVR had the highest performance (F1=0.993), with minimal differences observed between leads. Conclusions: In conclusion, this study successfully used machine learning methodologies, particularly the LightGBM model, to differentiate SR and AF based on power spectral features derived from 12-lead ECGs. The performance marked by an average F1-score of 0.988 and minimal interlead variation underscores the potential of machine learning algorithms to bolster real-time AF detection. This advancement could significantly improve patient care in intensive care units as well as facilitate remote monitoring through wearable devices, ultimately enhancing clinical outcomes. © 2024 JMIR Publications Inc..

AB  - The advancement of the medical equipment and its integration with the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has facilitated the remote monitoring of the health-related information of the patient and its analytics by the expert. IoMT network generates the large amount of medical data that are remotely accessed by the smart hospital, smart ambulance, and doctors for better observation and monitoring of the patient. In recent years, the smart connectivity of IoMT devices faces various known and unknown malware threats. To protect the IoMT system, there is a need to device an intelligent malware detection system for IoMT network. Thus, this paper proposes a hybrid Deep learning model by integrating the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Iterative Neighbourhood Component Analysis (INCA), for malware detection and identification task, named as (CNN-INCA-MD). The proposed model is evaluated on IoT malware dataset and achieved an accuracy of 96.98% with precision of 96.68%, recall of 96.67% and f1score of 96.66%. The proposed model is robust in detecting malware and outperforms from existing models. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Background: Physical disabilities become more common with advancing age. Rehabilitation restores function, maintaining independence for longer. However, the poor availability and accessibility of rehabilitation limits its clinical impact. Artificial Intelligence (AI) guided interventions have improved many domains of healthcare, but whether rehabilitation can benefit from AI remains unclear. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of AI-supported physical rehabilitation technology tested in the clinical setting to understand: 1) availability of AI-supported physical rehabilitation technology; 2) its clinical effect; 3) and the barriers and facilitators to implementation. We searched in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Science Citation Index (Web of Science), CIRRIE (now NARIC), and OpenGrey. Results: We identified 9054 articles and included 28 projects. AI solutions spanned five categories: App-based systems, robotic devices that replace function, robotic devices that restore function, gaming systems and wearables. We identified five randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which evaluated outcomes relating to physical function, activity, pain, and health-related quality of life. The clinical effects were inconsistent. Implementation barriers included technology literacy, reliability, and user fatigue. Enablers included greater access to rehabilitation programmes, remote monitoring of progress, reduction in manpower requirements and lower cost. Conclusion: Application of AI in physical rehabilitation is a growing field, but clinical effects have yet to be studied rigorously. Developers must strive to conduct robust clinical evaluations in the real-world setting and appraise post implementation experiences. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - Healthcare is an area of concern where the application of human-centred design practices and principles can enormously affect well-being and patient care. The provision of high-quality healthcare services requires a deep understanding of patients' needs, experiences, and preferences. Human activity recognition (HAR) is paramount in healthcare monitoring by using machine learning (ML), sensor data, and artificial intelligence (AI) to track and discern individuals' behaviours and physical movements. This technology allows healthcare professionals to remotely monitor patients, thereby ensuring they adhere to prescribed rehabilitation or exercise routines, and identify falls or anomalies, improving overall care and safety of the patient. HAR for healthcare monitoring, driven by deep learning (DL) algorithms, leverages neural networks and large quantities of sensor information to autonomously and accurately detect and track patients' behaviors and physical activities. DL-based HAR provides a cutting-edge solution for healthcare professionals to provide precise and more proactive interventions, reducing the burden on healthcare systems and improving patient well-being while increasing the overall quality of care. Therefore, the study presents an improved coyote optimization algorithm with a deep learning-assisted HAR (ICOADL-HAR) approach for healthcare monitoring. The purpose of the ICOADL-HAR technique is to analyze the sensor information of the patients to determine the different kinds of activities. In the primary stage, the ICOADL-HAR model allows a data normalization process using the Z-score approach. For activity recognition, the ICOADL-HAR technique employs an attention-based long short-term memory (ALSTM) model. Finally, the hyperparameter tuning of the ALSTM model can be performed by using ICOA. The stimulation validation of the ICOADL-HAR model takes place using benchmark HAR datasets. The wide-ranging comparison analysis highlighted the improved recognition rate of the ICOADL-HAR method compared to other existing HAR approaches in terms of various measures.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Sleep problems are serious issues that make life difficult for all people, including sleep apnea. Sleep apnea, which causes breathlessness for more than 10 s, is linked to severe health problems due to the serious damage it can induce. To mitigate the risk of these disorders, the monitoring of patients has become increasingly challenging. Wearable technologies offer an effective healthcare solution for remote patient monitoring and diagnosis. A novel wearable system based on Arduino technology is introduced, specifically designed to monitor the breath patterns of patients. The analysis of breath data from patients holds great importance for the diagnosis and continuous monitoring of sleep apnea. To address this need, an advanced image processing system based on deep learning techniques is presented. This system automatically detects respiratory patterns, including inhalation, exhalation, and breathlessness. The device has an average of 97.6% sensitivity, 79.7% specificity, and 96% accuracy in identifying breath patterns. The designed device can offer patients and healthcare institutions a simple, inexpensive, noninvasive, and ergonomic system for the analysis of breath patterns that can be further extended for sleep apnea diagnosis. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - The transformation of traditional hospitals to a smart healthcare system is a patient-centric, reliable, and smarter way to enhance healthcare facilities for individuals. These healthcare devices are based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and conventional network structures such as 3rd generation (3G) or 4th generation (4G). That did not provide the patient health data in the real-time scenario. Therefore, the integrated 5G-IoT system offers distinct benefits such as remote monitoring, surgery, and real-time data analysis of healthcare system that is operated with slice of dedicated network. It generates huge data with the billions of healthcare equipment that can be evaluated for decision making. This enormous data requires low latency, high-security, capacity, and more reliable techniques for evaluation. In this scenario, network slicing is one of the key solutions that can be considered for isolated end-to-end network structures. Network slicing enables logical and independent network virtual networks to be multiplexed for the same physical network. In this article, we propose an intelligent approach for network resource optimization and analysis of a 5G-IoT based smart healthcare network. We examine the performance of the machine learning algorithm by an automatic model, named A Fast Library for automated machine learning (FLAML). In addition, we perform network slicing to obtain resource optimization in 5G-IoT-based healthcare application. © 2023 by author(s).

AB  - Presently Every nation places a high value on healthcare due to the rise in trauma instances. The ideal approach in this case is thought to be an Internet of Things (IoT) based health monitoring system. A novel approach in internet technology, the Internet of Things (IoT) is an increasing study area, mainly in the field of healthcare. The rising use of wearable sensors and cellphones has allowed these remote health care monitoring systems to grow at such a rapid rate. IoT health monitoring helps patients receive the appropriate care for their present level of health even when a physician is far away. The notion of the IoT and deep learning are combined in this study to present a systematic method to identify trauma instances more effectively. By utilizing some of the biological information from the patient's body, such as temperature, heart rate, and other factors, this approach presents an overview of the IoT and is also used to monitor health status and identify symptoms in the human body. For fall detection using sensor nodes, the Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) analyses individuals' motion and architecture. The suggested method may be put in place for less money but has significant potential to identify symptoms by giving patients and suspected cases the care they need and reacting to life-or-death circumstances. Metrics such as precision, recall, F-measure, and accuracy are utilized to evaluate the results when applying classification algorithms. When compared to techniques like the Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K Nearest Neighbour (k-NN), the findings show that it has been very successful. © 2023

AB  - Stroke is one of the leading causes of disability among the elderly population and is a significant public health problem worldwide. The main impact of stroke is functional disabilities due to motor impairment after stroke. Advances in modern medicine and technology have significantly improved diagnosis and treatment; however, most post-stroke care is based on the effectiveness of rehabilitation. Stroke rehabilitation depends on two main components: (i) training (or therapy) to restore the patient to pre-stroke mobility and (ii) assessing motor functionality of affected patients performing activities to track motor recovery. This article highlights how combining wearable devices and machine learning (ML) produces new pathways for effective stroke rehabilitation. While wearable devices help capture patient movements at much finer time resolutions, ML allows us to build predictive models from wearable data to assist clinicians in diagnosis and treatments. Specifically, we expand on how wearable devices and ML can improve monitoring quality in training intervention, assessment, and remote monitoring. In addition, we provide our main findings from the literature, research challenges, and future directions in post-stroke therapies using wearable devices and ML.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Introduction: Asthma is a common chronic respiratory disease affecting 262 million people globally, causing half a million deaths each year. Poor asthma outcomes are frequently due to non-adherence to medication, poor engagement with asthma services, and a lack of objective diagnostic tests. In recent years, technologies have been developed to improve diagnosis, monitoring, and care. Areas Covered: Technology has impacted asthma care with the potential to improve patient outcomes, reduce healthcare costs, and provide personalized management. We focus on current evidence on home diagnostics and monitoring, remote asthma reviews, and digital smart inhalers. PubMed, Ovid/Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus and Google Scholar were searched in November 2023 with no limit by year of publication. Expert Opinion: Advanced diagnostic technologies have enabled early asthma detection and personalized treatment plans. Mobile applications and digital therapeutics empower patients to manage their condition and improve adherence to treatments. Telemedicine platforms and remote monitoring devices have the potential to streamline asthma care. AI algorithms can analyze patient data and predict exacerbations in proof-of-concept studies. Technology can potentially provide precision medicine to a wider patient group in the future, but further development is essential for implementation into routine care which in itself will be a major challenge. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Pig farming, a vital industry, necessitates proactive measures for early disease detection and crush symptom monitoring to ensure optimum pig health and safety. This review explores advanced thermal sensing technologies and computer vision-based thermal imaging techniques employed for pig disease and piglet crush symptom monitoring on pig farms. Infrared thermography (IRT) is a non-invasive and efficient technology for measuring pig body temperature, providing advantages such as non-destructive, long-distance, and high-sensitivity measurements. Unlike traditional methods, IRT offers a quick and labor-saving approach to acquiring physiological data impacted by environmental temperature, crucial for understanding pig body physiology and metabolism. IRT aids in early disease detection, respiratory health monitoring, and evaluating vaccination effectiveness. Challenges include body surface emissivity variations affecting measurement accuracy. Thermal imaging and deep learning algorithms are used for pig behavior recognition, with the dorsal plane effective for stress detection. Remote health monitoring through thermal imaging, deep learning, and wearable devices facilitates non-invasive assessment of pig health, minimizing medication use. Integration of advanced sensors, thermal imaging, and deep learning shows potential for disease detection and improvement in pig farming, but challenges and ethical considerations must be addressed for successful implementation. This review summarizes the state-of-the-art technologies used in the pig farming industry, including computer vision algorithms such as object detection, image segmentation, and deep learning techniques. It also discusses the benefits and limitations of IRT technology, providing an overview of the current research field.

AB  - The prevalence of heart failure (HF) is increasing, necessitating accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment. The accumulation of clinical information from patients with HF generates big data, which poses challenges for traditional analytical methods. To address this, big data approaches and artificial intelligence (AI) have been developed that can effectively predict future observations and outcomes, enabling precise diagnoses and personalized treatments of patients with HF. Machine learning (ML) is a subfield of AI that allows computers to analyze data, find pat-terns, and make predictions without explicit instructions. ML can be supervised, unsupervised, or semi-supervised. Deep learning is a branch of ML that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to find complex patterns. These AI technologies have shown significant potential in various aspects of HF research, including diagnosis, outcome prediction, classification of HF phenotypes, and optimization of treatment strategies. In addition, integrating multiple data sources, such as electrocardiography, electronic health records, and imaging data, can enhance the diagnostic accuracy of AI algorithms. Currently, wearable devices and remote monitoring aided by AI enable the earlier detection of HF and improved patient care. This review focuses on the rationale behind utilizing AI in HF and explores its various applications. © 2024. Korean Society of Heart Failure.

AB  - In this article, an assistive technology in the form of a stress monitoring system customized exclusively for people affected by autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is proposed. ASD tends to impact the linguistic and motor skills and the effects of stress often has a negative impact on the physical and mental health of the individuals. The suppressed heart rate variability (HRV) is found to be lesser in ASD affected individuals. This is considered as a key factor and the constraints of the parameters to be monitored such as heart rate, body temperature and body movements is set accordingly. The hardware module encompasses various sensors such as pulse sensor, temperature sensor and accelerometers and can be developed into a variety of wearables specific to the user. The acquired data is transmitted to a non-relational database whose data is extracted and processed by a machine learning model consisting of a linear regression algorithm and random forest classifier algorithm to generate and analyse reports to support the mental stress management of the user. This wearable device can be accommodated for remote monitoring of the users in mundane day to day situations and even in social habitats such as healthcare establishments and even in educational institutions. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Bharati Vidyapeeth's Institute of Computer Applications and Management.

AB  - The dramatic progresses of wireless technologies and wearable devices have significantly promoted the development and popularity of smart home, while digital twin (DT) emerges as a game changer benefiting from its enhanced capabilities of visualization and interaction. The DT is able to build a realtime and continuous visual replica of a physical object or process, and to provide realtime monitoring, anomaly prediction, smart interaction, and lifecycle management. This paper presents a DT model to empower healthcare monitoring in the smart home with the goals of graphical monitoring, healthcare prediction, and intelligent control. High fidelity DT of the house and its equipments is created for visualized monitoring, and two suites of devices are deployed for continuously acquiring the users' electrocardiograph (ECG) waves and the WiFi signals in the house. Two intelligent algorithms are then developed to perform fall detection from WiFi signals and to screen atrial fibrillation from ECG waves collected by wearable devices. Experimental results well validate the proposed model's effectiveness for smart home monitoring, and the advantages of the developed smart algorithms for healthcare prediction over counterparts.  © 1983-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Essential tremor (ET) is a prevalent neurological disorder that necessitates using objective and non-invasive methods for assessing symptom severity. Traditional visual assessments are often limited by subjectivity, while other wearable sensors or visual markers may result in unnatural movements. This study presents a novel contact-free visual-based pipeline for ET assessment that integrates refined whole-body pose estimation with Transformer-based tremor detection to quantify tremor severity at a fine-grained level. The proposed pose estimation method combines the Transformer with HRNet, effectively capturing spatial-temporal complementary information from multiple body parts and enabling highly accurate tremor detection. The Transformer-based tremor detection is well-suited for modeling long-range dependencies and sequential tremor data extracted by the pose estimation model, further improving the performance of our proposed method. Our study collected data from 61 patients with ET, achieving an average accuracy, recall, and F1 score of 95.6%/95.6%, 89.2%/95.0%, and 83.0%/92.4% for classifying ET severity both during rest and postural tasks, respectively. Our proposed method outperforms the temporal convolutional network baseline, increasing F1 scores by 21.17% and 14.22% for rest and postural tasks, respectively. This high level of accuracy makes our method highly useful for clinical applications such as remote monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment evaluation. Our proposed technique has many advantages over traditional ET assessment techniques, including non-invasiveness, contact-free operation, and not requiring any wearable sensors or visual markers. Moreover, our method can be applied to other movement disorders requiring objective measurements of symptom severity. In summary, our contact-free visual-based pipeline for ET assessment represents a significant improvement over traditional ET assessment techniques, and our quantification results demonstrate its potential for use in clinical settings. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - As described throughout this book, there are several different factors impacting the performance and strategy for healthcare organizations. Certainly, the industry will see changes tomorrow that we have not even imagined. Today, the industry is grappling with how to improve medical technology to get closer to patients, through artificial intelligence and digital transformation that will help organizations be more consumer centric. Population health management, telehealth, and remote patient monitoring are also becoming more advanced, as healthcare delivery moves outside of hospital walls. Interoperability will also become more important, with the ability to seamlessly share data between apps, providers, and multiple partners within the healthcare value chain. Re-examining how health is reimbursed, through value-based payments and bundled care, will force a higher focus on cost-effectiveness. Rapid deployment of new vaccines to deal with future pandemics also need to be part of the agenda. Public health in general will undergo significant transformations going forward as well. © 2024 James Langabeer.All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: e-Health has played a crucial role during the COVID-19 pandemic in primary health care. e-Health is the cost-effective and secure use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) to support health and health-related fields. Various stakeholders worldwide use ICTs, including individuals, non-profit organizations, health practitioners, and governments. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, ICT has improved the quality of healthcare, the exchange of information, training of healthcare professionals and patients, and facilitated the relationship between patients and healthcare providers. This study systematically reviews the literature on ICT-based automatic and remote monitoring methods, as well as different ICT techniques used in the care of COVID-19-infected patients. Objective: The purpose of this systematic literature review is to identify the e-Health methods, associated ICTs, method implementation strategies, information collection techniques, advantages, and disadvantages of remote and automatic patient monitoring and care in COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The search included primary studies that were published between January 2020 and June 2022 in scientific and electronic databases, such as EBSCOhost, Scopus, ACM, Nature, SpringerLink, IEEE Xplore, MEDLINE, Google Scholar, JMIR, Web of Science, Science Direct, and PubMed. In this review, the findings from the included publications are presented and elaborated according to the identified research questions. Evidence-based systematic reviews and meta-analyses were conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework. Additionally, we improved the review process using the Rayyan tool and the Scale for the Assessment of Narrative Review Articles (SANRA). Among the eligibility criteria were methodological rigor, conceptual clarity, and useful implementation of ICTs in e-Health for remote and automatic monitoring of COVID-19 patients. Results: Our initial search identified 664 potential studies; 102 were assessed for eligibility in the pre-final stage and 65 articles were used in the final review with the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The review identified the following eHealth methods—Telemedicine, Mobile Health (mHealth), and Telehealth. The associated ICTs are Wearable Body Sensors, Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms, Internet-of-Things, or Internet-of-Medical-Things (IoT or IoMT), Biometric Monitoring Technologies (BioMeTs), and Bluetooth-enabled (BLE) home health monitoring devices. Spatial or positional data, personal and individual health, and wellness data, including vital signs, symptoms, biomedical images and signals, and lifestyle data are examples of information that is managed by ICTs. Different AI and IoT methods have opened new possibilities for automatic and remote patient monitoring with associated advantages and weaknesses. Our findings were represented in a structured manner using a semantic knowledge graph (e.g., ontology model). Conclusions: Various e-Health methods, related remote monitoring technologies, different approaches, information categories, the adoption of ICT tools for an automatic remote patient monitoring (RPM), advantages and limitations of RMTs in the COVID-19 case are discussed in this review. The use of e-Health during the COVID-19 pandemic illustrates the constraints and possibilities of using ICTs. ICTs are not merely an external tool to achieve definite remote and automatic health monitoring goals; instead, they are embedded in contexts. Therefore, the importance of the mutual design process between ICT and society during the global health crisis has been observed from a social informatics perspective. A global health crisis can be observed as an information crisis (e.g., insufficient information, unreliable information, and inaccessible information); however, this review shows the influence of ICTs on COVID-19 patients' health monitoring and related information collection techniques. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Merging electrophysiology signal monitoring technology with wearable devices offers interesting future health care options. This study presented carbon-based screen-printing inks produced by mixing a graphite composite with a polymer emulsion to bind with flexible fabric substrates and tested with 10,000 bending cycles. The prepared carbon-based ink performed well for electrical conduction and vital signal response. Adding calcium carbonate resulted in a microstructure of graphite that decreased the electrical sheet resistance and resistance to 11.61 &#x03A9;&#x002F;&EmptySmallSquare; and 0.127 &#x03A9;. The signal-to-noise ratio of the electrocardiogram (ECG) was 31.02 dB with built-in front-end powering noise filtration. Noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP) was achieved by bio-impedance measurement and showed outstanding systolic and diastolic pressure values with a correlation coefficient of 0.799, and exhibited a similar interval time to define the same precise heart rate. The ECG data from the prepared electrode were applied to the machine learning models. The Random Forest (RF) model exhibited the optimized prediction value, with an F1 score of 99.9&#x0025;. Equipment made from carbon screen-printing inks showed potential for health care monitoring with no excessive pressure, dry processing, and repeatability as a flexible wearable bio-electronic device.

AB  - This chapter explores the transformative potential of integrating computer vision, artificial intelligence (AI), and the Internet of Things (IoT) in healthcare. We examine the opportunities and challenges of implementing these technologies in healthcare settings, including their potential to improve patient outcomes, enhance healthcare delivery, and reduce costs. We also consider the ethical and regulatory considerations that must be addressed when deploying these technologies, including privacy concerns and issues related to data ownership and control. Finally, we outline future directions for research and development in this area, including the need for interdisciplinary collaboration between computer science, healthcare, and regulatory experts to realize the full potential of these transformative technologies. Computer vision, AI, and IoT are rapidly evolving fields that have the potential to revolutionize healthcare. By leveraging these technologies, healthcare providers can collect and analyze vast amounts of data, enabling them to identify patterns and make more informed decisions about patient care. This can lead to earlier and more accurate diagnoses, more personalized treatment plans, and better patient outcomes. However, there are also significant challenges associated with the integration of these technologies in healthcare. For example, there are concerns about the accuracy and reliability of AI algorithms, as well as the potential for bias in their decision-making processes. Additionally, there are regulatory and ethical considerations related to data privacy, ownership, and control that must be addressed to ensure that these technologies are deployed in a responsible and ethical manner. Despite these challenges, the potential benefits of integrating computer vision, AI, and IoT in healthcare are too great to ignore. In the future, we can expect to see continued advances in these technologies, along with increased interdisciplinary collaboration between computer scientists, healthcare providers, and regulatory experts. By working together, we can unlock the full transformative potential of these technologies and improve healthcare outcomes for patients around the world. One promising area of application for computer vision, AI, and IoT in healthcare is remote patient monitoring. By using wearable devices and sensors, healthcare providers can collect real-time data on patient health and behavior, allowing them to detect and respond to potential issues before they become serious. This can lead to improved patient outcomes and reduced healthcare costs by avoiding unnecessary hospitalizations and emergency room visits. Another area of potential application is drug discovery and development. By using AI to analyze large datasets, researchers can identify promising drug candidates more quickly and accurately than traditional methods. This can lead to faster development of new drugs and therapies and ultimately improve patient outcomes. Overall, the integration of computer vision, AI, and IoT in healthcare holds great promise for improving patient outcomes, enhancing healthcare delivery, and reducing costs. However, realizing this potential will require continued investment in research and development, as well as careful attention to ethical and regulatory considerations. By working together, researchers, healthcare providers, and policymakers can ensure that these transformative technologies are deployed in a responsible and effective manner. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Alex Khang.

AB  - The fusion of Internet of Things (IoT) technology into healthcare, known as the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), has significantly enhanced medical treatment and operational efficiency. Real-time patient monitoring (RPM) and remote diagnostics enabled by IoMT allow doctors to treat more patients effectively and save lives. However, healthcare devices' interconnected nature makes them vulnerable to cyber-attacks, threatening patient privacy and security. Ensuring the security and accuracy of patient health data is paramount, as any tampering could have life-threatening consequences, especially in emergency situations. To address these challenges, this research focuses on developing robust security models to secure patient data in IoMT networks while meeting the growing demand for efficient healthcare services. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have the potential to be employed as the methodology for intrusion detection. The goal of this research is threefold: firstly, the linear support vector machine (LinSVM) model; secondly, the convolutional support vector machine (ConvSVM) model; and finally, the categorical embedding (CatEmb) model, which have been proposed to overcome the issue of security in a network. This article offers the CatEmb model as the first effort to use a DL-based embedding approach to recognize intrusion in the IoMT environment, utilizing patient biometric and network traffic flow data. Our experimental results show the efficacy of the proposed DL models, with the LinSVM achieving a training accuracy of 99.78%, ConvSVM reaching 99.98%, and CatEmb achieving 99.84%. These models outperform existing methodologies by 2.61% in detecting network intrusions, as demonstrated through metrics such as detection rate and F1-score. Furthermore, the proposed approaches are thoroughly compared with the existing state-of-the-art studies. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - Mental disorders, encompassing conditions like depression, pose a significant global health challenge. Traditional diagnostic methods, while valuable, have inherent limitations, necessitating the exploration of innovative approaches. In this study, we delved into the analysis of grapho-phonological data as potential objective indicators of depression. Our research journey began with an analysis of an existing database, containing handwriting and drawing data from both healthy individuals and those diagnosed with depressive disorders. Leveraging this data, we developed machine learning models designed to distinguish between these two groups. Notably, we observed that models utilizing drawing-related features outperformed those relying on writing features. This section of our study highlights the potential of combining these data for enhanced depression detection. The creation of a new database is a noteworthy addition, providing grapho-phonological data (i.e., handwriting, drawing and laughter data) from healthy and depressed subjects. The analysis of these data sets reached peak performance, achieving superior accuracy values in comprehensive classification models, underscoring the potential of this multi-modal approaches. The study also presents a streamlined, non-invasive protocol that allows to efficiently gather essential grapho-phonological data, taking only approximately 7 min per participant. Moreover, our work introduces the “Voice & Drawing App”, an accessible tool enabling remote data collection for mental health assessment. This innovation aligns with telemonitoring trends and offers a user-friendly solution, whether within clinical settings or patients’ homes. An accelerometer-based inertial measurement units system (IMUs) to capture motion patterns has been introduced into the app. This choice is driven by the recognition of the valuable information encoded in psychomotor behaviour, that can serve as indicators of depression. Our study highlights promising avenues for future research, including expanding subject populations, implementing automatic laughter recognition, and incorporating video data to capture facial expressions. Wearable devices with IMUs offer exciting opportunities for comprehensive depression assessment. In summary, our research seeks to improve our understanding of depression by exploring innovative approaches that incorporate graphological signals, laughter, and IMUs. These multidimensional strategies aim to enhance the accuracy of depression detection and telemonitoring, ultimately facilitating more timely and effective interventions in mental health care. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Postural instability is associated with disease status and fall risk in Persons with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS). However, assessments of postural instability, known as postural sway, leverage force platforms or wearable accelerometers, and are most often conducted in laboratory environments and are thus not broadly accessible. Remote measures of postural sway captured during daily life may provide a more accessible alterative, but their ability to capture disease status and fall risk has not yet been established. We explored the utility of remote measures of postural sway in a sample of 33 PwMS. Remote measures of sway differed significantly from lab-based measures, but still demonstrated moderately strong associations with patient-reported measures of balance and mobility impairment. Machine learning models for predicting fall risk trained on lab data provided an Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.79, while remote data only achieved an AUC of 0.51. Remote model performance improved to an AUC of 0.74 after a new, subject-specific k-means clustering approach was applied for identifying the remote data most appropriate for modelling. This cluster-based approach for analyzing remote data also strengthened associations with patient-reported measures, increasing their strength above those observed in the lab. This work introduces a new framework for analyzing data from remote patient monitoring technologies and demonstrates the promise of remote postural sway assessment for assessing fall risk and characterizing balance impairment in PwMS. © 2001-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Introduction: Apomorphine, a potent dopamine agonist, is a therapeutic option for patients with Parkinson’s disease and motor fluctuations. However, the adoption of and adherence to this therapy have been limited by the need for complex delivery devices and specialized care as well as resource consumption, posing challenges for new physicians. Thailand is a unique example of a developing nation that has successfully implemented and continued the use of this therapy by employing cooperative technology that has dramatically enhanced apomorphine delivery services. Methods: Establishing apomorphine delivery services requires significant resources and step-by-step solutions. We began our services by implementing various strategies in three chronological stages: the initial stage (2013–2015), intermediate stage (2016–2019), and current stage (2020–present), each presenting unique challenges. Together, we also implemented a proposed set of five mottos to strengthen our apomorphine delivery service. Using additive technology, we developed a patient registry platform that combined electronic data acquisition, video and remote monitoring using wearable sensors, and in-house mobile applications to support our service. Results: At the initial stage, we assembled a team to enhance the efficacy and confirm the safety of apomorphine treatment in our hospital. At the intermediate stage, we expanded our apomorphine delivery services beyond just the patients at our hospital. We supported other hospitals in Thailand in setting up their own apomorphine services by educating both physicians and nurses regarding apomorphine therapy. With this educational undertaking, increased apomorphine-related knowledge among medical professionals, and a greater number of hospitals providing apomorphine services, an increasing number of patients were administered apomorphine in subsequent years. Currently, we are providing effective apomorphine delivery to improve patient outcomes and are seamlessly integrating technology into clinical practice. Incorporating integrative technologies in our apomorphine delivery program yielded positive results in data collection and support throughout patient care, in tracking patients’ statuses, in the long-term use of this treatment, and in increasing medication adherence rates. Conclusion: This perspective paper describes how technology can help provide supportive healthcare services in resource-constrained environments, such as in Thailand, offering a step-by-step approach to overcoming several limitations. The valuable insights from our 10-year journey in successfully integrating technology into apomorphine delivery services can benefit new physicians seeking to replicate our success.

AB  - Many stroke survivors experience persistent upper extremity impairment that limits performance in activities of daily living. Upper limb recovery requires high repetitions of task-specific practice. Stroke survivors are often prescribed task practices at home to supplement rehabilitation therapy. A poor quality of task practices, such as the use of compensatory movement patterns, results in maladaptive neuroplasticity and suboptimal motor recovery. There currently lacks a tool for the remote monitoring of movement quality of stroke survivors’ task practices at home. The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of classifying movement quality at home using a wearable IMU. Nineteen stroke survivors wore an IMU sensor on the paretic wrist and performed four functional upper limb tasks in the lab and later at home while videorecording themselves. The lab data served as reference data to classify home movement quality using dynamic time warping. Incorrect and correct movement quality was labeled by a therapist. The home task practice movement quality was classified with an accuracy of 92% and F1 score of 0.95 for all tasks combined. Movement types contributing to misclassification were further investigated. The results support the feasibility of a home movement quality monitoring system to assist with upper limb rehabilitation post stroke. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are needed in high-performance piezoresistive sensors due to their strong strain-induced bandgap modification and thereby large gauge factors. However, integrating a conventional high-temperature chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-grown TMD with a flexible substrate necessitates a transfer process that inevitably degrades the sensing properties of the TMDs and increases the overall fabrication complexity. We present a high-performance piezoresistive strain sensor that employs large-area PdSe2 films grown directly on polyimide (PI) substrates via plasma-assisted selenization of a sputtered Pd film. The reliable strain transfer from the substrate to the PdSe2 film ensures an outstanding strain-sensing capability of the sensor. Specifically, the sensors have a gauge factor of up to −315 ± 2.1, a response time under 25 ms, a detection limit of 8 × 10−6, and an exceptional stability of over 104 loading–unloading cycles. By attaching the sensors to the skin surface, we demonstrate their application for measuring physiological parameters in health care monitoring, including motion, voice, and arterial pulse vibration. Furthermore, using the PdSe2 film sensor combined with deep learning technology, we achieved intelligent recognition of artery temperature from arterial pulse signals with only a 2% difference between predicted and actual temperatures. The excellent sensing performance, together with the advantages of low-temperature fabrication and simple device structure, make the PdSe2 film sensor promising for wearable electronics and health care sensing systems.

AB  - Respiratory rate (RR) is an important biomarker as RR changes can reflect severe medical events, such as heart disease, lung disease, and sleep disorders. Unfortunately, standard manual RR counting is prone to human error and cannot be performed continuously. This study proposes a method for continuously estimating RR, RRWaveNet. The method is a compact end-to-end deep learning model which does not require feature engineering and can use low-cost raw photoplethysmography (PPG) as input signal. RRWaveNet was tested subject-independently and compared to baseline in four data sets (BIDMC, CapnoBase, WESAD, and SensAI) and using three window sizes (16, 32, and 64 s). RRWaveNet outperformed current state-of-the-art methods with mean absolute errors at an optimal window size of 1.66 ± 1.01, 1.59 ± 1.08, 1.92 ± 0.96, and 1.23 ± 0.61 breaths per minute for each data set. In remote monitoring settings, such as in the WESAD and SensAI data sets, we apply transfer learning to improve the performance using two other ICU data sets as pretraining data sets, reducing the MAE by up to 21%. This shows that this model allows accurate and practical estimation of RR on affordable and wearable devices. Our study also shows feasibility of remote RR monitoring in the context of telemedicine and at home.  © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Physical rehabilitation and exercise training have emerged as promising solutions for improving health, restoring function, and preserving quality of life in populations that face disparate health challenges related to disability. Despite the immense potential for rehabilitation and exercise to help people with disabilities live longer, healthier, and more independent lives, people with disabilities can experience physical, psychosocial, environmental, and economic barriers that limit their ability to participate in rehabilitation, exercise, and other physical activities. Together, these barriers contribute to health inequities in people with disabilities, by disproportionately limiting their ability to participate in health-promoting physical activities, relative to people without disabilities. Therefore, there is great need for research and innovation focusing on the development of strategies to expand accessibility and promote participation in rehabilitation and exercise programs for people with disabilities. Here, we discuss how cutting-edge technologies related to telecommunications, wearables, virtual and augmented reality, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing are providing new opportunities to improve accessibility in rehabilitation and exercise for people with disabilities. In addition, we highlight new frontiers in digital health technology and emerging lines of scientific research that will shape the future of precision care strategies for people with disabilities. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Purpose of Review: This review aims to explore the applications of digital technology in cardiovascular care across African countries. It highlights the opportunities and challenges associated with leveraging technology to enhance patient self-monitoring, remote patient-clinician interactions, telemedicine, clinician and patient education, and research facilitation. The purpose is to highlight how technology can transform cardiovascular care in Africa. Recent Findings: Recent findings indicate that the increasing penetration of mobile phones and internet connectivity in Africa offers a unique opportunity to improve cardiovascular care. Smartphone-based applications and text messaging services have been employed to promote self-monitoring and lifestyle management, although challenges related to smartphone ownership and digital literacy persist. Remote monitoring of patients by clinicians using home-based devices and wearables shows promise but requires greater accessibility and validation studies in African populations. Telemedicine diagnosis and management of cardiovascular conditions demonstrates significant potential but faces adoption challenges. Investing in targeted clinician and patient education on novel digital technology and devices as well as promoting technology-assisted research for participant recruitment and data collection can facilitate cardiovascular care advancements in Africa. Summary: Technology has the potential to revolutionize cardiovascular care in Africa by improving access, efficiency, and patient outcomes. However, barriers related to limited resources, supportive infrastructure, digital literacy, and access to devices must be addressed. Strategic actions, including investment in digital infrastructure, training programs, community collaboration, and policy advocacy, are crucial to ensuring equitable integration of digital health solutions. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Tele-rehabilitation has the potential to transform the way patients are monitored from home, overcoming geographical barriers, enhancing accessibility, and promoting patient autonomy. The development of a tele-rehabilitation system capable of automating the recognition of performed exercises may significantly impact rehabilitation outcomes. Implementation of machine learning algorithms combined with magneto-inertial measurement units (M-IMUs) has enabled remote home-based rehabilitation therapy through wearable systems. Thus, in this study sixteen healthy participants and sixteen patients with rotator cuff injuries were enrolled to perform six shoulder rehabilitation exercises while wearing a wearable system based on three M-IMUs. This study aimed to conduct a thorough analysis of the features extracted from time-series data collected by these three sensors during these exercises. The statistical analysis indicated statistically significant differences in task features, but not between participant groups. Three features, identified as the most representative and distinctive among all tasks, were subsequently, used to train the Support Vector Classifier in classifying the six exercises. The obtained classification results are promising for the application of this wearable device in remote monitoring of patients with shoulder musculoskeletal disorders during home-based rehabilitation exercises. Further studies will involve the implementation of the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), along with the training of additional machine learning models. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - The rapid advancement in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and wireless networking technologies has ushered in a new era for healthcare, particularly in the domain of smart health monitoring for elderly populations. This paper explores the development and implementation of a state-of-the-art cyber-physical wireless network system designed to enhance the health monitoring of elderly individuals, thereby improving their quality of life and enabling independent living. By leveraging the interconnectivity of CPS within a 6G wireless network framework, our proposed system facilitates real-time health monitoring and emergency response through the seamless integration of wearable health sensors, mobile devices, and cloud computing services. The core of our system architecture is built on robust wireless communication protocols that ensure reliable data transmission from wearable sensors to the central monitoring system. This paper introduces a digital twin (DT)-based model designed to enhance healthcare monitoring within smart homes, aiming at graphical monitoring, healthcare prediction, and intelligent control. A high-fidelity DT of the home and its equipment is developed for visual monitoring purposes, and two sets of devices are utilised to continually gather users’ electrocardiograph (ECG) waves and the WiFi signals within the home. Furthermore, two advanced deep learning algorithms are proposed for detecting falls using WiFi signals and identifying atrial fibrillation from ECG waves recorded by wearable devices. The effectiveness of the proposed model for smart home monitoring is confirmed through experimental results, showcasing the superiority of the developed intelligent algorithms in healthcare prediction compared to existing solutions. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - A novel wireless wearable, Holter, was developed to automatically measure blood pressure and heart rate based on the principle of oscillometry. It offers two measuring modes: on-demand - users activate the measurements at will, and programmable - measurements are triggered automatically at a selected rate. The accuracy of the results was validated using a mercury plethysmograph and simulator. The results are uploaded to a cloud server for remote monitoring and immediate care from healthcare providers when necessary. The main device is secured to an inflatable cuff wrapping around the user's arm, consisting of a microprocessor control board and other electromechanical parts. Firmware was implemented to control the device's functioning and wirelessly handshake to a smartphone developed for iOS and Android platforms for activating the Holter, displaying data, and facilitating communication between patients, healthcare providers, and relatives. Hence, this Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem is useful in the LMIC society, where more and more adults not living with their parents can still care for them from a distance, and healthcare can be conveniently provided to patients living in remote areas. The collected data can be stored in a digital repository and utilized by artificial intelligence technology. The calibrated Holter accurately measured blood pressure under various conditions, including normal blood pressure, weak pulse, mild exercise, obesity, and tachycardia, except for arrhythmia, where significant inaccuracies were observed. Standard conditions resulted in higher accuracy, achieving 97.1% based on 300 samples, compared to 74.25% accuracy under arrhythmic conditions with 200 samples. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG. 2024.

AB  - Objective. Physiological sensor data (e.g. photoplethysmograph) is important for remotely monitoring patients’ vital signals, but is often affected by measurement noise. Existing feature-based models for signal cleaning can be limited as they might not capture the full signal characteristics. Approach. In this work we present a deep learning framework for sensor signal cleaning based on dilated convolutions which capture the coarse- and fine-grained structure in order to classify whether a signal is noisy or clean. However, since obtaining annotated physiological data is costly and time-consuming we propose an autoencoder-based semi-supervised model which is able to learn a representation of the sensor signal characteristics, also adding an element of interpretability. Main results. Our proposed models are over 8% more accurate than existing feature-based approaches with half the false positive/negative rates. Finally, we show that with careful tuning (that can be improved further), the semi-supervised model outperforms supervised approaches suggesting that incorporating the large amounts of available unlabeled data can be advantageous for achieving high accuracy (over 90%) and minimizing the false positive/negative rates. Significance. Our approach enables us to reliably separate clean from noisy physiological sensor signal that can pave the development of reliable features and eventually support decisions regarding drug efficacy in clinical trials. © 2023The Author(s).

AB  - Microalgal biotechnology holds the potential for renewable biofuels, bioproducts, and carbon capture applications due to unparalleled photosynthetic efficiency and diversity. Outdoor open raceway pond (ORP) cultivation enables utilization of sunlight and atmospheric carbon dioxide to drive microalgal biomass synthesis for production of bioproducts including biofuels; however, environmental conditions are highly dynamic and fluctuate both diurnally and seasonally, making ORP productivity prediction challenging without time-intensive physical measurements and location-specific calibrations. Here, for the first time, we present an image-based deep learning method for the prediction of ORP productivity. Our method is based on parameter profile plot images of sensor parameters, including pH, dissolved oxygen, temperature, photosynthetically active radiation, and total dissolved solids. These parameters can be remotely monitored without physical interaction with ORPs. We apply the model to data we generated during the Unified Field Studies of the Algae Testbed Public-Private-Partnership (ATP3 UFS), the largest publicly available ORP data set to date, which includes millions of sensor records and 598 productivities from 32 ORPs operated in 5 states in the United States. We demonstrate that this approach significantly outperforms an average value based traditional machine learning method (R2 = 0.77 ≫ R2 = 0.39) without considering bioprocess parameters (e.g., biomass density, hydraulic retention time, and nutrient concentrations). We then evaluate the sensitivity of image and monitoring data resolutions and input parameter variations. Our results demonstrate ORP productivity can be effectively predicted from remote monitoring data, providing an inexpensive tool for microalgal production and operational forecasting. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Pressure sensors with high flexibility and sensitivity face significant challenges in meeting the delicate balance and synergy among suitable active sensing electrode materials, substrates, and their device geometry design. In this contribution, layer-engineered delaminated Ti-MXene (DL-Ti3C2Tx) is introduced, which has relatively wider interlayer spacing through intercalated large organic molecules and accordion-like open internal microstructure than the narrower pristine Ti3C2Tx MXene (Ti-MXene), graphene/carbon nanotube's interlayer spacing suitably fulfill the high sensitivity and flexibility requirement through accessible electronic pathways under the external pressure. Notably, a milder in-situ ambient condition etching is performed to eliminate the associated safety risks for a flexible personal healthcare monitoring pressure sensor. DL-Ti3C2Tx MXene-empowered, flexible pressure sensor demonstrates a broad range of sensitivities up to a very high-pressure of 20.8 kPa at a sensitivity of 242.3 kPa−1 with a fast response and recovery time (<300 ms). A twofold increase in pressure sensitivity performance of DL-Ti3C2Tx MXene than that of Ti-MXene, graphene can be attributed to the engineered wider interlayer distance among the delaminated DL-Ti3C2Tx MXene layers causing a facile interlayer atomic movements, contacts, and reversible compressibility. The current economical, scalable DL-Ti3C2Tx MXene flexible pressure sensor can provide future safe personal healthcare artificial intelligence with real-time tracking ability. © 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

AB  - Cardiac monitoring is crucial for health assessment, and in the era of technology, the integration of cutting-edge technologies has opened up new opportunities for non-invasive and remote monitoring solutions. The focus of this study is cardiac monitoring use-case involving Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML). Sensor data from Electrocardiogram(ECG) and Photoplethysmography(PPG) waveforms, which are collected and pre-processed such as signal cleaning and robust feature extraction to ensure that the acquired data are kept intact also we introduce a 1-D Convolutional Neural Network for efficient estimation of heart modalities. We introduced comprehensive analysis that includes time, frequency, and nonlinear domains which proves to be a critical method to validate our data sets and aim to study the underlying HRV metrics. This task of remote monitoring and deployment is handled by the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense, which uses Tiny Machine Learning's capabilities for real-time heart state classification. To summarize the applications of wearable ECG & PPG devices, specifically their analysis, identify their potential use case for remote applications using Edge AI, and outline our future research directions to realize their full potential to prevent and diagnose CVDs.  © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - In this present time, Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has been of considerable aid in the case of health monitoring and recovery. The exploitation of machine learning with an intelligent agent in the area of health informatics gathered using HAR augments the decision-making quality and significance. Although many research works conducted on Smart Healthcare Monitoring, there remain a certain number of pitfalls such as time, overhead, and falsification involved during analysis. Therefore, this paper proposes a Statistical Partial Regression and Support Vector Intelligent Agent Learning (SPR-SVIAL) for Smart Healthcare Monitoring. At first, the Statistical Partial Regression Feature Extraction model is used for data preprocessing along with the dimensionality-reduced features extraction process. Here, the input dataset the continuous beat-to-beat heart data, triaxial accelerometer data, and psychological characteristics were acquired from IoT wearable devices. To attain highly accurate Smart Healthcare Monitoring with less time, Partial Least Square helps extract the dimensionality-reduced features. After that, with these resulting features, SVIAL is proposed for Smart Healthcare Monitoring with the help of Machine Learning and Intelligent Agents to minimize both analysis falsification and overhead. Experimental evaluation is carried out for factors such as time, overhead, and false positive rate accuracy concerning several instances. The quantitatively analyzed results indicate the better performance of our proposed SPR-SVIAL method when compared with two state-of-the-art methods. © 2024 Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is a platform that combines Internet of Things (IoT) technology with medical applications, enabling the realization of precision medicine, intelligent healthcare, and telemedicine in the era of digitalization and intelligence. However, the IoMT faces various challenges, including sustainable power supply, human adaptability of sensors and the intelligence of sensors. In this study, we designed a robust and intelligent IoMT system through the synergistic integration of flexible wearable triboelectric sensors and deep learning-assisted data analytics. We embedded four triboelectric sensors into a wristband to detect and analyze limb movements in patients suffering from Parkinson's Disease (PD). By further integrating deep learning-assisted data analytics, we actualized an intelligent healthcare monitoring system for the surveillance and interaction of PD patients, which includes location/trajectory tracking, heart monitoring and identity recognition. This innovative approach enabled us to accurately capture and scrutinize the subtle movements and fine motor of PD patients, thus providing insightful feedback and comprehensive assessment of the patients’ conditions. This monitoring system is cost-effective, easily fabricated, highly sensitive, and intelligent, consequently underscores the immense potential of human body sensing technology in a Health 4.0 society. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Medical Internet of Things (MIoT) is a rapidly growing field that promises to revolutionize health care. The ability to connect devices and collect data from them has the potential to transform the way it monitors and treat patients. However, the security and privacy of this data is a major concern. The cryptography and other conventional methods for security in resource constrained MIoT has several shortcomings. First, it does not provide adequate protection for patient data. Second, it is not designed to work with the large number of devices and huge volumes of data that are typically generated in MIoT applications. In this article, secure M-Trust privacy protocol (SMP) has been designed to address these issues. The SMP protocol uses a combination of trust, cryptographic, and machine learning techniques to provide security and privacy for data in transit. The SMP protocol has been designed to work with the smart health care monitoring system to provide a secure and private communication channel between devices in the system. The SMP protocol is an improvement over the existing security and privacy protocols for medical data. The simulation results proves that the SMP protocol is more efficient and scalable than the existing protocols. The SMP protocol is a valuable addition to the MIoT landscape and can help improve the privacy of data exchanged between medical devices.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Architectural, cognitive, and service layers are the three components that come together to form the system as a whole. The data that is acquired by the instruments at the application layer is processed by the system that is in charge of the network. The conceptual layer, which is where edge sensors are put, is responsible for managing radio resource management and intersensor connections in order to solve the issues raised by the physical layer about increasing power consumption and increased latency. In response to the processed data provided by the logical layer, the application layer will make judgements. The key objective is to lower prices so that they are more accessible to regular people. Patients will not only be able to maintain their financial stability, but they will also have easy access to private therapy. This research presents a solution based on the Internet of Things (IoT), which will simplify the usage of a generally complicated medical device while allowing you to do it at a reasonable cost and in the comfort of your own home. The Elephant Herding Optimizations using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) method is discussed here in order to differentiate between healthy and unhealthy patterns of behavior. The scoring function, also known as fuzzy logic, is used in order to arrive at a conclusion on the severity of the irregularity. In the end, tests were carried out to see how well the recommended work fared in contrast to the existing approaches in terms of specificity, recall, f1-score, and ROC curve. These metrics were examined.  © 2023 - IOS Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is the subset of the Internet of Things (IoT) that connects multiple medical devices, collect information/data from devices, and transmits and process data in real-time. IoMT is crucial for increasing electronic device accuracy, reliability, and productivity in the healthcare industry. IoMT has emerged as a next-generation bio-analytical tool that converges network-linked biomedical devices with relevant software applications for advancing human health. Adapting IoMT and associated technologies has fixed several problems using telemedicine, remote monitoring, sensors, robotics, etc. However, adopting IoMT technologies for a large population is challenging due to extensive data management, privacy, security, upgradation, scalability, etc. Although significant research has been carried out in this domain, identifying emerging trends and highlighting the technological advancement and challenges within IoMT is required for its success. Moreover, it will aid policymakers, scientists, healthcare practitioners, and researchers to measure the pertinence of IoMT in healthcare sectors more efficiently. This review discusses the evolution of IoMT, Machine Learning Integration, Security, and interoperability challenges of IoMT devices.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Serious clinical complications (SCC; CTCAE grade ≥ 3) occur frequently in patients treated for hematological malignancies. Early diagnosis and treatment of SCC are essential to improve outcomes. Here we report a deep learning model-derived SCC-Score to detect and predict SCC from time-series data recorded continuously by a medical wearable. In this single-arm, single-center, observational cohort study, vital signs and physical activity were recorded with a wearable for 31,234 h in 79 patients (54 Inpatient Cohort (IC)/25 Outpatient Cohort (OC)). Hours with normal physical functioning without evidence of SCC (regular hours) were presented to a deep neural network that was trained by a self-supervised contrastive learning objective to extract features from the time series that are typical in regular periods. The model was used to calculate a SCC-Score that measures the dissimilarity to regular features. Detection and prediction performance of the SCC-Score was compared to clinical documentation of SCC (AUROC ± SD). In total 124 clinically documented SCC occurred in the IC, 16 in the OC. Detection of SCC was achieved in the IC with a sensitivity of 79.7% and specificity of 87.9%, with AUROC of 0.91 ± 0.01 (OC sensitivity 77.4%, specificity 81.8%, AUROC 0.87 ± 0.02). Prediction of infectious SCC was possible up to 2 days before clinical diagnosis (AUROC 0.90 at −24 h and 0.88 at −48 h). We provide proof of principle for the detection and prediction of SCC in patients treated for hematological malignancies using wearable data and a deep learning model. As a consequence, remote patient monitoring may enable pre-emptive complication management. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Post-surgical treatments of the human throat often require continuous monitoring of diverse vital and muscle activities. However, wireless, continuous monitoring and analysis of these activities directly from the throat skin have not been developed. Here, we report the design and validation of a fully integrated standalone stretchable device platform that provides wireless measurements and machine learning-based analysis of diverse vibrations and muscle electrical activities from the throat. We demonstrate that the modified composite hydrogel with low contact impedance and reduced adhesion provides high-quality long-term monitoring of local muscle electrical signals. We show that the integrated triaxial broad-band accelerometer also measures large body movements and subtle physiological activities/vibrations. We find that the combined data processed by a 2D-like sequential feature extractor with fully connected neurons facilitates the classification of various motion/speech features at a high accuracy of over 90%, which adapts to the data with noise from motion artifacts or the data from new human subjects. The resulting standalone stretchable device with wireless monitoring and machine learning-based processing capabilities paves the way to design and apply wearable skin-interfaced systems for the remote monitoring and treatment evaluation of various diseases. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Due to the growth of Internet of Things (IoT) and advanced sensing based technologies have enabled the development of the miniature-based system. In recent years, the use of wearable and mobile sensors for Human Walking Gesture Recognition has become more popular in various applications, including health care, surveillance, robotics, and industry. The recent growth of edge computing technology for industry 4.0 has provided the opportunity to design the low power and less computationally expensive devices. The edge computing devices cannot support heavy computation and provide great efficiency by reducing the network size and communication latency. Deep learning algorithms have recently demonstrated high performance in HAR. However, the deep learning (DL) models require very high computation systems, which make them ineffective when used on edge devices. In this research, a hybrid deep learning-based model is trained to recognize the various gestures. Three deep learning-based models, namely one-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN), Convolutional Neural Network–Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM), and CNN-Gated Recurrent Unit (CNN-GRU), are designed to test the various human mobility gestures. The WISDM, PAMAP2, and UCI-HAR benchmark datasets were used to assess these models. Among the three datasets, the best accuracies of the models are 99.89%, 97.28%, and 96.78%, respectively, achieved for CNN-LSTM hybrid model. In future, the work can be extended to design an end-to-end edge computing application using Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sensing microcontroller board. The compressed deep learning model will be fused on the Arduino Nano board to recognize various human motion gestures.

AB  - In the midst of a global health crisis, it is of utmost importance for healthcare technologies to possess the capability to regulate and monitor the physiological variables of patients remotely and automatically. The effective control of mean arterial pressure (MAP) in a closed-loop manner is particularly critical for individuals who are critically ill or in the process of recovering from surgical procedures. Within the framework of the present research, an adaptive closed-loop structure has been formulated with the objective of controlling a patient's MAP through governed administration of the medication sodium nitroprusside (SNP), to attain the desired MAP levels under varying conditions. The proposed closed-loop technique incorporates an intelligent controller known as the active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) with the intention of tracking the desired MAP value, alongside the utilization of continuous action policy gradient (CAPG) for the optimization of the controller's coefficients. Under the DRL strategy, an actor is responsible for generating policy requests, while a critic assesses the efficacy of the actor's policy directives. This approach uses gradient descent to train the weight values of both actor and critic networks, and it is dependent on the reward return linked to the MAP fault. Upon comparing the outcomes of the recommended structure with conventional models, numerical simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed system in coping with varying working conditions, key-value fluctuations, and uncertainties, while effectively maintaining the desired mean arterial pressure and drug administration rate.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - In recent times, there has been a notable rise in the utilization of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) frameworks particularly those based on edge computing, to enhance remote monitoring in healthcare applications. Most existing models in this field have been developed temperature screening methods using RCNN, face temperature encoder (FTE), and a combination of data from wearable sensors for predicting respiratory rate (RR) and monitoring blood pressure. These methods aim to facilitate remote screening and monitoring of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and COVID-19. However, these models require inadequate computing resources and are not suitable for lightweight environments. We propose a multimodal screening framework that leverages deep learning-inspired data fusion models to enhance screening results. A Variation Encoder (VEN) design proposes to measure skin temperature using Regions of Interest (RoI) identified by YoLo. Subsequently, the multi-data fusion model integrates electronic records features with data from wearable human sensors. To optimize computational efficiency, a data reduction mechanism is added to eliminate unnecessary features. Furthermore, we employ a contingent probability method to estimate distinct feature weights for each cluster, deepening our understanding of variations in thermal and sensory data to assess the prediction of abnormal COVID-19 instances. Simulation results using our lab dataset demonstrate a precision of 95.2&#x0025;, surpassing state-of-the-art models due to the thoughtful design of the multimodal data-based feature fusion model, weight prediction factor, and feature selection model.

AB  - Nowadays, deep learning has been extensively supported in various healthcare applications to detect diseases from the human body. It becomes so powerful when it is combined with other domains like deep learning and machine vision. The conventional methods of healthcare monitoring systems only contain smart wearables and vision-based methods that are limited to detecting only the specific issues from the human body. The proposed system gives a detailed summary and experiments on a deep learning-based non-invasive disease diagnosis approach in a smart healthcare system. The proposed system is processed into two steps: first, AX-YOLOV5 (Arbitrary Extra-Large You Only Look Once Version 5) algorithm is to detect the position of the patient in the video input, and next the AlphaPose Library is to detect 17 key points from the patient’s body, and their body movements are continuously captured by an IP camera. AX-YOLOV5 algorithm analyzes the real-time images from the video sequences to localize the position of the patient’s body. The key points are compared with the five most important key point coordinates of the human body using the rule of mining associations. These key points are used to identify the body position of a patient either lying on a bed or sitting. The temporal thresholding technique recognizes healthcare issues by how repeatedly the coordinates of the key points of the human body move in a certain period. Last, the distance of key points and the temporal threshold helps to categorize the diseases of the human organs. Moreover, the coordinates of the key points are accessed for identifying the correct disease from the human body. Based on the experimental results, the confusion matrix created by the proposed system reveals the accuracy is 99%. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) are a kind of Internet of Things (IoT) systems which are used in the healthcare domain. Nowadays, there are an abundance of wearable smart devices, either commercial or clinical, which can be used to collect vital signs and transmit the collected data to remote servers for further analysis. Remote patient monitoring, smart diagnostics, and autonomous control of chronic diseases are examples of different healthcare services that can be provided by these systems at a lower cost and higher efficiency compared to traditional healthcare settings. However, as data related to patients' health status and treatment history, transmitted in these systems, are highly confidential and private, security and privacy concerns in their widespread adoption may arise. Deap Learning (DL) algorithms, with their ability in extracting knowledge from big data generated in these systems, can be leveraged to design smart security mechanisms. In this survey study, the recent literature on the DL-assisted security and privacy provisioning frameworks in IoMT systems are categorized and summarized with respect to their main contributions. Finally, some possible future directions are introduced to assist interested researchers to continue research in this domain.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The integration of IoT devices to healthcare sector has enabled remote monitoring of patient data and delivery of suitable diagnostics whenever required. Because of the rapid advancement in embedded software and network connectivity, Cyber physical systems (CPS) have been widely used in the medical industry to provide top-notch patient care in a variety of clinical scenarios because of the quick advancements in embedded software and network connectivity. Due to the heterogeneity of the medical devices used in these systems, there is a requirement for providing efficient security solutions for these intricate environments. Any alteration to the data could have an effect on the patient’s care, which may lead to accidental deaths in an emergency. Deep learning has the potential to offer an efficient solution for intrusion detection because of the high dimensionality and conspicuous dynamicity of the data involved in such systems. Therefore, in this study, a deep learning-assisted Attack Detection Framework has been suggested for safely transferring healthcare data in medical cyber physical systems. Additionally, the efficacy of the suggested framework in comparison to various cutting-edge machine and ensemble learning techniques has been assessed on healthcare dataset consisting of sixteen thousand records of normal and attack data and the experimental findings indicate that the suggested framework offers promising outcomes when compared with the state-of-the-art machine learning and ensemble learning approaches. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Telemedicine can provide benefits in patient affected by chronic diseases or elderly citizens as part of standard routine care supported by digital health. The GATEKEEPER (GK) Project was financed to create a vendor independent platform to be adopted in medical practice and to demonstrate its effect, benefit value, and scalability in 8 connected medical use cases with some independent pilots. This paper, after a description of the GK platform architecture, is focused on the creation of a FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource) IG (Implementation Guide) and its adoption in specific use cases. The final aim is to combine conventional data, collected in the hospital, with unconventional data, coming from wearable devices, to exploit artificial intelligence (AI) models designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a new parsimonious risk prediction model for Type 2 diabetes (T2D).

AB  - This pilot study aimed to predict exercise exertion levels from physiological data collected from wearable devices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). During a 16-minute cycling exercise, real-time ECG, pulse rate, oxygen saturation, and revolutions per minute (RPM) data were collected at three intensity levels. In addition, the study subjects' ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) were gathered once per minute throughout each exercise session. Each 16-minute exercise session was further divided into eight 2-minute windows. Based on the self-reported RPEs, each 2-minute window was labeled as either "high exertion" or "low exertion" classes. RPMs, heart rate, and oxygen saturation levels were averaged for each window to form the predictive features. In addition, collected ECG data were used to extract the heart rate variability (HRV) features in both the temporal and frequency domains. We used the minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) algorithm to select the best predictive features. The top selected features were then used to train and test the LSTM classifier to predict the next window's exertion level. The designed classifier showed the training accuracy of 85.7% and the testing accuracy of 78.6%. This pilot study shows the potential of a deep learning classifier to track perceived exercise exertion automatically in real-time. ©2024 IEEE.

AB  - The remarkable increase in the number of patients poses challenges to healthcare providers in telemedicine systems, and certain challenges are associated with the difficulties of identifying the most urgent emergencies to save lives. Remote monitoring of patients with multiple chronic diseases (MCDs) is a major issue that must be addressed. This work aims to improve the triage system for remote patients who are far from hospital and use telemedicine system by considering the variation in their chronic diseases (chronic heart, hypertension, hypotension, and diabetes diseases). The proposed framework named machine learning-based remote triage framework in telemedicine (ML-ART) collects the patient’s data using medical sensors and sources within Internet of medical things (IoMT) environment, transfers the data through gateway to telemedicine servers in the hospital, where machine learning is performed to classify (triages) each patient into one of five categories (normal, cold, sick, urgent, and risk) depending on the medical emergency level of the patients. The simulation results showed that the decision tree (DT) algorithm has the most accurate result, 100%, compared to the relevant algorithm (neural network (NN) 97%, support vector machine (SVM) 91%, and random forest (RF) 97%). The performance of (DT) logically matched the medical triage procedure. Moreover, the (ML-ART) outcomes improve the performance of e-triage system for remote patients and pave the way for future works in telemedicine systems through moving from remote monitoring to remote diagnostics. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In the wake of recent advancements in technologies such as 5G, the Internet of Things (IoT), and Artificial Intelligence (AI), unprecedented smart solutions are made possible. Plenty of IoT use cases that have not been practical so far. IoT is being used to realize eHealth and mHealth applications to enable Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) in the healthcare domain. The health of human beings has been given the highest importance and there are many practical issues in the existing healthcare domain. The problems include delays in healthcare service and high costs involved in the procedures. Many prominent personalities died of heart attacks due to delays in medical intervention. Therefore, the need of the hour is to have real-time patient monitoring and treatment without causing delay. IoT has brought its grace to realize applications like remote patient monitoring (RPM). Wearable devices (biosensors) with IoT integration transmit the vital signs from patients to doctors in real time, enable to initiate treatment immediately. The phenomenon RPM has the potential to save time, healthcare costs, and improve the quality of life of patients and the quality of healthcare services as well. This paper throws light on the present state of the art on RPM using IoT and paves the way for identifying potential research gaps for leveraging RPM systems. The proposed IoT-integrated RPM for patient health monitoring employs an algorithm called data analytics for remote patient monitoring and presented experimental results that lead the system to analyze patient health details. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) based Arrhythmia Classification is a cutting-edge algorithm that amalgamates the abilities of the IoT and advanced medical diagnosis to revolutionize the detection and classification of arrhythmias— irregular heartbeats that may indicate fundamental cardiovascular issues. This technique leverages IoT devices, namely connected health monitors and wearable sensors, to continuously gather electrocardiogram (ECG) information from individuals. This information, streamed in real-time, provides a great opportunity for timely and remote monitoring of cardiac health. Leveraging the abilities of deep learning and IoT, this technique provides an automated and more sophisticated means of classifying and detecting arrhythmias, improving the efficiency and accuracy of diagnoses. This article presents an Internet of Things Enabled Based Arrhythmia Classification using the Dandelion Optimization Algorithm with Ensemble Learning (AC-DOAEL) method. The presented AC-DOAEL technique utilizes IoT-based data collection with an ensemble learning-based classification process. For the arrhythmia detection and classification process, the AC-DOAEL technique follows an ensemble learning algorithm such as long short-term memory (LSTM), autoencoder (AE), and bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) models. To improve the recognition rate of the ensemble models, the AC-DOAEL technique uses DOA as a hyperparameter optimizer. The simulation outcomes of the AC-DOAEL method are well-studied on benchmark ECG data. The experimental result analysis inferred the greater performance of the AC-DOAEL algorithm with other techniques. © 2024, American Scientific Publishing Group (ASPG). All rights reserved.

AB  - Telemonitoring is the use of electronic devices such as smartphones to remotely monitor patients. It provides great convenience and enables timely medical decisions. To facilitate the decision making for each patient, a model is needed to translate the data collected by the patient's smartphone into a predicted score for his/her disease severity. To train a robust predictive model, semi-supervised learning (SSL) provides a viable approach by integrating both labeled and unlabeled samples to leverage all the available data from each patient. There are two challenging issues that need to be simultaneously addressed in using SSL for this problem: (1) feature selection from high-dimensional noisy telemonitoring data; and (2) instance selection from many, possibly redundant unlabeled samples. We propose a novel SSL model allowing for simultaneous feature and instance selection, namely the S2SSL model. We present a real-data application of telemonitoring for patients with Parkinson's Disease using their smartphone-collected activity data such as tapping and speaking. A total of 382 features were extracted from the activity data of each patient. 74 labeled and 563 unlabeled instances from 37 patients were used to train S2SSL. The trained model achieved a high accuracy of 0.828 correlation between the true and predicted disease severity scores on a validation dataset. Note to Practitioners - Telemonitoring is an emerging health care platform enabled by smartphones and wearables. Because it allows for health data to be collected anytime and anywhere, patients can be frequently monitored and medical decisions can be made more timely and effectively. This paper addresses the data science challenges in leveraging the telemonitoring platform to benefit patient care. Specifically, we propose a new model, S2SSL, to tackle these challenges and provide better robustness, accuracy, and efficiency. This paper may be interesting to health care practitioners seeking advanced analytics capabilities to model and integrate the data collected through telemonitoring devices, with ultimate purposes of improving the decision in treating each patient and increasing patient access to specialized care.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Hospital readmission prediction models often perform poorly, but most only use information collected until the time of hospital discharge. In this clinical trial, we randomly assigned 500 patients discharged from hospital to home to use either a smartphone or wearable device to collect and transmit remote patient monitoring (RPM) data on activity patterns after hospital discharge. Analyses were conducted at the patient-day level using discrete-time survival analysis. Each arm was split into training and testing folds. The training set used fivefold cross-validation and then final model results are from predictions on the test set. A standard model comprised data collected up to the time of discharge including demographics, comorbidities, hospital length of stay, and vitals prior to discharge. An enhanced model consisted of the standard model plus RPM data. Traditional parametric regression models (logit and lasso) were compared to nonparametric machine learning approaches (random forest, gradient boosting, and ensemble). The main outcome was hospital readmission or death within 30 days of discharge. Prediction of 30-day hospital readmission significantly improved when including remotely-monitored patient data on activity patterns after hospital discharge and using nonparametric machine learning approaches. Wearables slightly outperformed smartphones but both had good prediction of 30-day hospital-readmission. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Traditional trial designs have well-recognized inefficiencies and logistical barriers to participation. Decentralized trials and digital health solutions have been suggested as potential solutions and have certainly risen to the challenge during the pandemic. Clinical trial designs are now increasingly data driven. The use of distributed clinical data networks and digitization has helped to fundamentally upgrade existing research systems. A trial design may vary anywhere from fully decentralized to hybrid to traditional on-site. Various decentralization components are available for stakeholders to increase the reach and pace of their trials, such as electronic informed consent, remote interviews, administration, outcome assessment, monitoring, and laboratory and imaging modalities. Furthermore, digital health technologies can be included to enrich study conduct. However, careful consideration is warranted, including assessing verification and validity through usability studies and having various contingencies in place through dedicated risk assessment. Selecting the right combination depends not just on the ability to handle patient care and the medical know-how but also on the availability of appropriate technologic infrastructure, skills, and human resources. Throughout this process, quality of evidence generation and physician-patient relation must not be undermined. Here we also address some knowledge gaps, cost considerations, and potential impact of decentralization and digitization on inclusivity, recruitment, engagement, and retention. Last, we mention some future directions that may help drive the necessary change in the right direction. © 2023 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research

AB  - Continuous monitoring of stress in individuals during their daily activities has become an inevitable need in present times. Unattended stress is a silent killer and may lead to fatal physical and mental disorders if left unidentified. Stress identification based on individual judgement often leads to under-diagnosis and delayed treatment possibilities. EEG-based stress monitoring is quite popular in this context, but impractical to use for continuous remote monitoring.Continuous remote monitoring of stress using signals acquired from everyday wearables like smart watches is the best alternative here. Non-EEG data such as heart rate and ectodermal activity can also act as indicators of physiological stress. In this work, we have explored the possibility of using nonlinear features from non-EEG data such as (a) heart rate, (b) ectodermal activity, (c) body temperature (d) SpO2 and (e) acceleration in detecting four different types of neurological states; namely (1) Relaxed state, (2) State of Physical stress, (3) State of Cognitive stress and (4) State of Emotional stress. Physiological data of 20 healthy adults have been used from the noneeg database of PhysioNet.Results: We used two machine learning models; a linear logistic regression and a nonlinear random forest to detect (a) stress from relaxed state and (4) the four different neurological states. We trained the models using linear and nonlinear features separately. For the 2-class and 4-class problems, using nonlinear features increased the accuracy of the models. Moreover, it is also proved in this study that by using nonlinear features, we can avoid the use of complex machine learning models. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Intelligent sensors have attracted substantial attention for various applications, including wearable electronics, artificial intelligence, healthcare monitoring, and human-machine interactions. However, there still remains a critical challenge in developing a multifunctional sensing system for complex signal detection and analysis in practical applications. Here, we develop a machine learning-combined flexible sensor for real-time tactile sensing and voice recognition through laser-induced graphitization. The intelligent sensor with a triboelectric layer can convert local pressure to an electrical signal through a contact electrification effect without external bias, which has a characteristic response behavior when exposed to various mechanical stimuli. With the special patterning design, a smart human-machine interaction controlling system composed of a digital arrayed touch panel is constructed to control electronic devices. Based on machine learning, the real-time monitoring and recognition of the changes of voice are achieved with high accuracy. The machine learning-empowered flexible sensor provides a promising platform for the development of flexible tactile sensing, real-time health detection, human-machine interaction, and intelligent wearable devices. © 2023 American Chemical Society.

AB  - PURPOSE The advent of new medical devices allows patients with asthma to self-monitor at home, providing a more complete picture of their disease than occasional in-person clinic visits. This raises a pertinent question: which devices and parameters perform best in exacerbation detection? METHODS A total of 149 patients with asthma (90 children, 59 adults) participated in a 6-month observational study. Participants (or parents) regularly (daily for the first 2 weeks and weekly for the next 5.5 months, with increased frequency during exacerbations) performed self-examinations using 3 devices: an artificial intelligence (AI)-aided home stethoscope (providing wheezes, rhonchi, and coarse and fine crackles intensity; respiratory and heart rate; and inspiration-to-expiration ratio), a peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) meter, and a peak expiratory flow (PEF) meter and filled out a health state survey. The resulting 6,029 examinations were evaluated by physicians for the presence of exacerbations. For each registered parameter, a machine learning model was trained, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated to assess its utility in exacerbation detection. RESULTS The best single-parameter discriminators of exacerbations were wheezes intensity for young children (AUC 84% [95% CI, 82%-85%]), rhonchi intensity for older children (AUC 81% [95% CI, 79%-84%]), and survey answers for adults (AUC 92% [95% CI, 89%-95%]). The greatest efficacy (in terms of AUC) was observed for a combination of several parameters. CONCLUSIONS The AI-aided home stethoscope provides reliable information on asthma exacerbations. The parameters provided are effective for children, especially those younger than 5 years of age. The introduction of this tool to the health care system might enhance asthma exacerbation detection substantially and make remote monitoring of patients easier. © 2023, Annals of Family Medicine, Inc.

AB  - Global population growth might have an impact on how much each country spends on healthcare. Rapid technological advancement makes it possible that patients can be monitored remotely by the healthcare system without visiting hospitals in person. The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is such a paradigm which enables doctors to treat more patients and save many lives through remote monitoring of patients by integrating Internet of Things (IoT) with medical devices. It can provide more accurate diagnosis and treatment when deep learning (DL) algorithms are deployed in analysis of medical data. DL algorithms play an inevitable role in assessing the patient data maintained in IoMT servers and forecasting the existence of deadly illnesses. DL not only can diagnose major problems like tumors, heart disorders, skin diseases, COVID-19, etc., but it can also provide alerts for healthcare professionals. Security is another vertical framework that should be included in IoMT to ensure secured data access. Apart from health monitoring and diagnosis, the medical servers and HCRs (healthcare records) can be secured from attackers by using an intrusion detection system using DL techniques. This chapter discusses the various DL technologies applied in healthcare monitoring, healthcare diagnosis, and intrusion detection system of IoMT systems. © 2024 Rajiv Pandey, Pratibha Maurya and Raymond Chiong.

AB  - Chronic respiratory illnesses exert a major strain on healthcare systems globally, necessitating creative ways to optimize patient outcomes and treatment. This work presents a new technique for remote monitoring and treatment of chronic respiratory illnesses that blends wearable sensor data with artificial intelligence (AI). The method's properties are highlighted, including the employment of Random Forest, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) as three important algorithms for modeling illness development, forecasting exacerbations, and spotting abnormalities in real-time patient data. Our method has proven to be a big success. It is now conceivable to consistently forecast illness exacerbations, which speeds up medical treatments and decreases the likelihood of life-threatening respiratory crises. Real-time vital sign monitoring gives comprehensive, up-to-date data to patients and healthcare practitioners while allowing people to actively govern their own health. Real-time feedback and individualized treatment regimens assist in enhancing patient involvement. By addressing privacy and ethical concerns, adequate data management has been achieved. The integration of wearable sensors with AI provides a considerable improvement in the treatment of chronic respiratory illnesses. It enables for a more proactive, patient-centered, and data-driven approach to healthcare. The results not only boost patient outcomes, but also offer the ability to minimize healthcare expenses and deliver tailored therapy on a worldwide scale.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Due to the expanding growth of populations worldwide, infectious disease expenses are increasing rapidly. Patients with lesser chronic health problems are often encouraged to recover at home, which requires continuous remote monitoring and recommendation systems for decision-making. To overcome the above-mentioned challenges and reduce connectivity between infected patients and medical officers, we develop an artificial intelligence (AI)-based healthcare prototype in edge networks to monitor and analyze health parameters remotely. In the first phase of the work, health parameters are collected through multiple biosensors, including temperature, pulse rate, and oxygen saturation, and stored at the edge of the network. In the second phase, the monitoring data are preprocessed and analyzed using the neural network (NN) model in the edge devices for decision-making about the health status of the infected patient. Finally, the performance of the proposed model is evaluated using a real-time dataset, and multiple performance metrics are collected from the developed prototype to assess its effectiveness. The extensive simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed model over the existing ML models, i.e., the NN model achieves 94.05% accuracy, which is higher than the existing ones.  © 2001-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Purpose of reviewWe highlight the recent advances in home monitoring of patients with asthma, and show that these advances converge towards the implementation of digital twin systems.Recent findingsConnected devices for asthma are increasingly numerous, reliable and effective: new electronic monitoring devices extend to nebulizers and spacers, are able to assess the quality of the inhalation technique, and to identify asthma attack triggers when they include a geolocation function; environmental data can be acquired from databases and refined by wearable air quality sensors; smartwatches are better validated. Connected devices are increasingly integrated into global monitoring systems. At the same time, machine learning techniques open up the possibility of using the large amount of data collected to obtain a holistic assessment of asthma patients, and social robots and virtual assistants can help patients in the daily management of their asthma.SummaryAdvances in the internet of things, machine learning techniques and digital patient support tools for asthma are paving the way for a new era of research on digital twins in asthma. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

AB  - Mental disorders, including depression, pose a significant global health challenge. The rise in the prevalence of mental health issues demands innovative diagnostic tools and early intervention. This article presents a study that harnesses the power of machine learning and multi-modal data analysis to develop a robust classifier for distinguishing between healthy individuals and those with depression. The study utilizes graphological signals, such as handwriting and drawing as potential markers for depression. In this study we conducted an analysis on an existing database, upon which we developed machine learning models that outperformed existing literature. The results demonstrate the potential of these signals accurately classify individuals, with implications for early detection and telemedicine applications. Additionally, we collected new data, including handwriting, drawing, and laughter recordings, which will be utilized to create new models with the aim of achieving more effective performance. Our study also includes the integration of an inertial motion sensor into a mobile app, offering prospects for wearable technology and expanded diagnostic capabilities.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Due to their excellent mechanical properties and high tensile strain sensitivity, conductive hydrogels show great potential applications in the fields of artificial intelligence and human-machine interaction. The integration of reliable resilience, excellent viscosity and high strain sensitivity is a great challenge for conductive hydrogels. Here, inspired by human skin with a layered structure, glycerol was first introduced into a dual-network structure to prepare a hydrogel with hydrogen bonds, endowing the hydrogels with high resilience and adhesion. A mixture of graphene oxide and carbon nanotubes was sprayed on the hydrogel as a conductive layer to achieve high strain sensing. Then, a hydrogel with good toughness and high resilience was prepared by in situ polymerization as an elastic layer. Benefitting from its unique crack response mechanism, the integrated sensor showed high sensitivity (gauge factor = 20). Additionally, it presented a wide strain range (0-300%), super adhesion (56.9 N m−1) to pigskin with similar elastic modulus to the human body, and low hysteresis. This study provides a feasible solution for the improvement of wearable electronic devices for healthcare monitoring. © 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Mobile health (mHealth) has recently had significant advances in tele-dermatology (TD) thanks to the developments following the COVID-19 pandemic. This topic is very important, as telemedicine and mHealth, when applied to dermatology, could improve both the quality of healthcare for citizens and the workflow in the health domain. The proposed study was centered on the last three years. We conducted an overview on the opportunities, the perspectives, and the problems involved in TD integration with mHealth. The methodology of the narrative review was based on: (I) a search of PubMed and Scopus and (II) an eligibility assessment, using properly proposed parameters. The outcome of the study showed that during the COVID-19 pandemic, TD integration with mHealth advanced rapidly. This integration enabled the monitoring of dermatological problems and facilitated remote specialist visits, reducing face-to-face interactions. AI and mobile apps have empowered citizens to take an active role in their healthcare. This differs from other imaging sectors where information exchange is limited to professionals. The opportunities for TD in mHealth include improving service quality, streamlining healthcare processes, reducing costs, and providing more accessible care. It can be applied to various conditions, such as (but not limited to) acne, vitiligo, psoriasis, and skin cancers. Integration with AI and augmented reality (AR), as well as the use of wearable sensors, are anticipated as future developments. However, integrating TD with mHealth also brings about problems and challenges related to regulations, ethics, cybersecurity, data privacy, and device management. Scholars and policymakers need to address these issues while involving citizens in the process. © 2023 by the author.

AB  - Owing to increasing connected medical devices and rapid development of deep learning technologies, the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has attracted great attention for healthcare monitoring with intelligent sensors. Radar serves as a non-contact healthcare device, continuously measuring human's vital signs and behavior to provide daily and comprehensive long-term record on health status. However, radar sensor data collected from various users and families usually involve sensitive personal information, while traditional deep learning technologies using IoMT radar data may present high privacy leakage risks. This paper proposes FedRadar, a novel federated multi-task transfer learning framework for radar-based heartbeat rate and activity monitoring in IoMT to solve these challenges. It deals with the decentralized structure, training personalized multi-task models collaboratively, combining the shared relevance knowledge of human's physiological information while keeping personal radar data locally for privacy protection. First, the multi-task neural network is built on the spatial-temporal radar data to capture the potential relationship and shared representations between human's vital sign and activity. Furthermore, the federated learning with knowledge transfer scheme is designed to achieve personalized local models by transferring coarse relevant features and keeping fine-grained individual information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of FedRadar with 2.8% and 2.5% superior than local training model respectively on the accuracy of heartbeat rate estimation and activity classification in realistic constructed radar datasets. In addition, FedRadar is extensible and suitable to continuously monitor multiple health indicators with privacy protection in IoMT. The FedRadar codes and constructed radar datasets are available on https://github.com/bupt-uwb/FedRadar. © 2004-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Resistance training is an exercise modality that involves using weights or resistance to strengthen and tone muscles. It has become popular in recent years, with numerous people including it in their fitness routines to ameliorate their strength, muscle mass, and overall health. Still, resistance training can be complex, requiring careful planning and execution to avoid injury and achieve satisfactory results. Wearable technology has emerged as a promising tool for resistance training, as it allows monitoring and adjusting training programs in real time. Several wearable devices are currently available, such as smart watches, fitness trackers, and other sensors that can yield detailed physiological and biomechanical information. In resistance training research, this information can be used to assess the effectiveness of training programs and identify areas for improvement. Wearable technology has the potential to revolutionize resistance training research, providing new insights and opportunities for developing optimized training programs. This review examines the types of wearables commonly used in resistance training research, their applications in monitoring and optimizing training programs, and the potential limitations and challenges associated with their use. Finally, it discusses future research directions, including the development of advanced wearable technologies and the integration of artificial intelligence in resistance training research. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Emerging eHealth tools including wearable technology and telemedicine are becoming increasingly popular. This advancement revolutionizes the early detection and management of diseases such as Parkinson Disease (PD). Due to the loss of dopamine-producing neurons, PD is a progressive central nervous system condition that affects fundamental motor abilities, with hand tremors often being the first symptom. Despite the importance of early diagnosis, there is currently no conclusive test for PD. In our work, we consider a diagnostic tool for the early detection and diagnosis of PD by analyzing hand-drawn spiral and wave patterns. Hence, we aim in our model to automate the PD s early diagnosis. This innovation opens up a realm of possibilities, particularly in enabling remote monitoring and timely intervention. In this paper, we use two deep learning models, Inception V3 and Xception, to predict the risk of PD based on the pattern of the drawings. The models were trained on augmented data consisting of more than 4500 images. Our diagnostic tool achieves an accuracy rate of 97% which ultimately improves the lives of countless individuals battling this challenging condition.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is recently seeing significant advances in teledermatology (TD), also thanks to the developments that have taken place during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the last two years, there was an important development of studies that focused on opportunities, perspectives, and problems in this field. The topic is very important because the telemedicine and AI applied to dermatology have the opportunity to improve both the quality of healthcare for citizens and the workflow of healthcare professionals. This study conducted an overview on the opportunities, the perspectives, and the problems related to the integration of TD with AI. The methodology of this review, following a standardized checklist, was based on: (I) a search of PubMed and Scopus and (II) an eligibility assessment, using parameters with five levels of score. The outcome highlighted that applications of this integration have been identified in various skin pathologies and in quality control, both in eHealth and mHealth. Many of these applications are based on Apps used by citizens in mHealth for self-care with new opportunities but also open questions. A generalized enthusiasm has been registered regarding the opportunities and general perspectives on improving the quality of care, optimizing the healthcare processes, minimizing costs, reducing the stress in the healthcare facilities, and in making citizens, now at the center, more satisfied. However, critical issues have emerged related to: (a) the need to improve the process of diffusion of the Apps in the hands of citizens, with better design, validation, standardization, and cybersecurity; (b) the need for better attention paid to medico-legal and ethical issues; and (c) the need for the stabilization of international and national regulations. Targeted agreement initiatives, such as position statements, guidelines, and/or consensus initiatives, are needed to ensure a better result for all, along with the design of both specific plans and shared workflows. © 2023 by the author.

AB  - Heart failure is a growing concern due to its high incidence nowadays, also representing a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In this paper we propose a web-based platform that incorporates both the clinical data prediction aspect and the continuous monitoring of the heart health. We implement multiple machine learning models that can support the doctors in the process of classification between a healthy and unhealthy situation. The platform benefits from an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) sub-system that processes biometric data from smart wearables and displays it in customizable dashboards for a more illustrative visualization. The prediction service integrates three Machine Learning (ML) techniques, namely Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes Classifier, and a custom Artificial Neural Network responsible for making classifications on the monitored data. The results illustrate that the proposed solution's usage for performing remote monitoring and heart health assessment is feasible, obtaining promising accuracies with the aid of a public heart failure dataset (best accuracy of 88.5%).  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Current remote monitoring of COVID-19 patients relies on manual symptom reporting, which is highly dependent on patient compliance. In this research, we present a machine learning (ML)-based remote monitoring method to estimate patient recovery from COVID-19 symptoms using automatically collected wearable device data, instead of relying on manually collected symptom data. We deploy our remote monitoring system, namely eCOVID, in two COVID-19 telemedicine clinics. Our system utilizes a Garmin wearable and symptom tracker mobile app for data collection. The data consists of vitals, lifestyle, and symptom information which is fused into an online report for clinicians to review. Symptom data collected via our mobile app is used to label the recovery status of each patient daily. We propose a ML-based binary patient recovery classifier which uses wearable data to estimate whether a patient has recovered from COVID-19 symptoms. We evaluate our method using leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation, and find that Random Forest (RF) is the top performing model. Our method achieves an F1-score of 0.88 when applying our RF-based model personalization technique using weighted bootstrap aggregation. Our results demonstrate that ML-assisted remote monitoring using automatically collected wearable data can supplement or be used in place of manual daily symptom tracking which relies on patient compliance. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Flexible strain sensors have attracted great interest in many fields, including wearable devices, healthcare monitoring, and electronic skin. However, their non-linearity and tardy response time severely influence their sensing precision, and their low toughness, inferior environmental adaptation and non-recyclability are bad for their durability and unfavorable for electronic waste management. Here, we designed and synthesized a wide linear range and fast response strain sensor based on ionic conductive hydrogels (PVA-CS-PA hydrogels) using biodegradable polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and chitosan (CS) as the polymer backbone, and biogenic phytic acid (PA) as the crosslinker. PVA-CS-PA hydrogels are tough and ductile. The hydrogel with a volume ratio of 3 : 2 for PA : H2O (PVA-CS-3PA-2 hydrogel), had a stretchability of 915 ± 32.44%, strength of 6.02 ± 0.18 MPa, and fracture energy of 5.28 ± 0.24 kJ m−2. It was also thermoplastic and anti-drying (more than 90% water retention after 30 days). The hydrogel-based strain sensor displayed a wide linear working range up to 900% strain, a fast response time within 50 ms, and reliable stability to detect subtle and large motions. Moreover, its sensing performance is maintained well after a thermoplastic process and long-term storage, suggesting it has reusability and a long lifetime. This tough, wide linear range, fast response, green, and recyclable hydrogel-based strain sensor is expected to pave the way for the development of environmentally friendly and high-performance artificial intelligence in versatile electronic applications. © 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases have increased in the graph over the past few years worldwide. Annually, it is estimated that coronary heart disease (CHD) kills approximately 382,820 people in the world. According to statistics, in the year 2022 around 200 million people are living with coronary heart disease thus, prevention and detection of CVD are important. According to surveys, India will have more cardiac patients than any other nation by the year 2023. Thus, electrocardiograms, which are used to monitor the electrical activity of the heart, are more of a need than a pleasure. Remote vital sign monitoring systems have become a promising solution to detect and prevent heart attacks. This study proposes a health monitoring system that utilizes wearable devices to collect and analyze data on the vital signs of heart attack patients continuously. The system also incorporates machine-learning algorithms to analyze the data, identify patterns and anomalies, and generate real-time alerts for healthcare professionals in case of any abnormalities. The proposed system can be a valuable tool in preventing and detecting heart attacks and has the potential to revolutionize how healthcare professionals monitor and treat heart attack patients. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Coronary artery disease (CAD), an acute and life-threatening cardiovascular disease, is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Coronary angiography, the principal diagnostic tool for CAD, is invasive, expensive, and requires a lot of skilled effort. The current study aims to develop an automated and non-invasive CAD detection model and improve its performance as closely as possible to clinically acceptable diagnostic sensitivity. Electrocardiogram (ECG) characteristics are observed to be altered due to CAD and can be studied to develop a screening tool for its detection. The subject's clinical information can help broadly identify the high-cardiac-risk population and serve as a primary step in diagnosing CAD. This paper presents an approach to automatically detect CAD based on clinical data, morphological ECG features, and heart rate variability (HRV) features extracted from short-duration Lead-II ECG recordings. A few popular machine-learning classifiers, including support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), K-nearest neighbours (KNN), Gaussian Naïve Bayes (GNB), and multi-layer perceptron (MLP), are trained on the extracted feature space, and their performance is evaluated. Classifiers built by integrating clinical data and features extracted from ECG recordings demonstrated better performance than those built on each feature set separately, and the RF classifier outperforms other considered machine learners and reports an average testing accuracy of 94% and a G-mean score of 92% with a 5-fold cross-validation training accuracy of 95(± 0.04)%.Clinical relevance-The proposed method uses a brief, single-lead ECG recording and performs similarly to current clinical practices in an explainable manner. This makes it suitable for deployment via wearable technology (like smart watch gadgets) and telemonitoring, which may facilitate an earlier and more widespread CAD diagnosis. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Recently, deep learning and the Internet of Things (IoT) have been widely used in the healthcare monitoring system for decision making. Disease prediction is one of the emerging applications in current practices. In the method described in this paper, lung cancer prediction is implemented using deep learning and IoT, which is a challenging task in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). Because lung cancer is a dangerous medical disease that must be identified at a higher detection rate, disease-related information is obtained from IoT medical devices and transmitted to the server. The medical data are then processed and classified into two categories, benign and malignant, using a multi-layer CNN (ML-CNN) model. In addition, a particle swarm optimization method is used to improve the learning ability (loss and accuracy). This step uses medical data (CT scan and sensor information) based on the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). For this purpose, sensor information and image information from IoMT devices and sensors are gathered, and then classification actions are taken. The performance of the proposed technique is compared with well-known existing methods, such as the Support Vector Machine (SVM), probabilistic neural network (PNN), and conventional CNN, in terms of accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, F-score, and computation time. For this purpose, two lung datasets were tested to evaluate the performance: Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC) and Linear Imaging and Self-Scanning Sensor (LISS) datasets. Compared to alternative methods, the trial outcomes showed that the suggested technique has the potential to help the radiologist make an accurate and efficient early lung cancer diagnosis. The performance of the proposed ML-CNN was analyzed using Python, where the accuracy (2.5–10.5%) was high when compared to the number of instances, precision (2.3–9.5%) was high when compared to the number of instances, sensitivity (2.4–12.5%) was high when compared to several instances, the F-score (2–30%) was high when compared to the number of cases, the error rate (0.7–11.5%) was low compared to the number of cases, and the computation time (170 ms to 400 ms) was low compared to how many cases were computed for the proposed work, including previous known methods. The proposed ML-CNN architecture shows that this technique outperforms previous works. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - The convergence of Internet-based technology with primary care utility is critical for the worldwide amalgamation of quality medical management and its accessibility. Innovation has remained a significant aspect of medical care, allowing physicians to employ a variety of instruments to examine, administer, and observe patients. This paper’s central emphasis is on e-health data collection, conveyance, and surveillance apparatus. The wireless monitoring system monitors patients’ medical metrics and communicates them to the furthest edge via the ZigBee gateway. This paper introduces an IoT-enabled smart e-healthcare system that can continuously monitor patients' vital signs and the real-time room environment where patients are currently positioned. This system collects data from the hospital premises using five sensors: the body temperature sensor, the heartbeat sensor, the room temperature sensor, the CO2 sensor, and the CO sensor. For each situation, the percentage of errors in the developed scheme is less than 2%. The patient's situation is relayed to medical personnel via a portal, where they can monitor, process, and analyze the patient's real-time situation. A low-power communication device and an embedded smart IoT system are being designed and developed with the goal of covertly gathering physiological metrics without interfering with daily life. Sensor-based data analytics using machine learning methods were used in this study to identify predictors and/or sudden abnormality indicators accurately. The data for heart rate and body temperature is analyzed using the bio-medical sensors embedded with an ARM Cortex-A7 microcontroller. For the benchmark accuracy of the dataset, a detailed calculation of experiments in the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) with various machine learning techniques is compared. It has been exemplified through extensive testing that the recommended procedure outperforms machine learning methodologies with a 15% increase in accuracy, facilitating rapid alarms to prevent the aftereffects of abnormalities if they occur, which the system without the utilized methodology lags. Cloud storage allows for the analysis of parameters regarding patients. The error between observed and actual data is analyzed to validate the proposed Internet of Medical Things model. The performance of the proposed method is further identified by using various classifications, like decision trees, discriminant analysis, support vector machines, and Naive Bayes, for detecting any variation from normal data or disorder on real-time datasets. © 2023 Seventh Sense Research Group®

AB  - Aggression in children is highly prevalent and can have devastating consequences, yet there is currently no objective method to track its frequency in daily life. This study aims to investigate the use of wearable-sensor-derived physical activity data and machine learning to objectively identify physical-aggressive incidents in children. Participants (n = 39) aged 7 to 16 years, with and without ADHD, wore a waist-worn activity monitor (ActiGraph, GT3X+) for up to one week, three times over 12 months, while demographic, anthropometric, and clinical data were collected. Machine learning techniques, specifically random forest, were used to analyze patterns that identify physical-aggressive incident with 1-min time resolution. A total of 119 aggression episodes, lasting 7.3 ± 13.1 min for a total of 872 1-min epochs including 132 physical aggression epochs, were collected. The model achieved high precision (80.2%), accuracy (82.0%), recall (85.0%), F1 score (82.4%), and area under the curve (89.3%) to distinguish physical aggression epochs. The sensor-derived feature of vector magnitude (faster triaxial acceleration) was the second contributing feature in the model, and significantly distinguished aggression and non-aggression epochs. If validated in larger samples, this model could provide a practical and efficient solution for remotely detecting and managing aggressive incidents in children. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Wearable sensors and the data they gather are becoming more popular, which will hopefully lead to improvements in diagnostic methods and overall quality of life. The patient may take early preventative action if they know that their vital signs are being monitored regularly. There is a pressing need to close the gap between conventional medical practice and cutting-edge scientific development in order to speed up patient care. Since the worldwide epidemic, healthcare monitoring systems have seen massive growth in their user base. With the use of IoT, healthcare may shift from being primarily based on hospitals to being shared between hospitals and patients' homes. The practice of profile monitoring is becoming more common in the quality assurance industry. When it comes to making predictions, machine learning clearly outperforms traditional conditional flow of programs. This is true across a broad variety of use cases, from predicting the weather to detecting fraud in a network. However, a bigger data set is required for model training with each gain in prediction accuracy, which in turn raises the requirement for faster hardware and greater processing capacity. As a result, you can only use regular computers or the cloud to run your ML models. The purpose of this work is to implement a linear regression-based machine learning model on a low-power microcontroller for use in IoT-based wearables for health prediction.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - One of the most significant phases of human life is health. Every society is paying more consideration to and implementing knowledge in the areas of health and healthcare. Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being used in the healthcare industry to provide accurate and rapid outcomes. Predictions about the onset of disease help doctors save the lives of their patients by intervening early. Smart health monitoring systems are becoming a reality thanks to the IoT. The IoT is functioning as a catalyst for artificial intelligence applications in healthcare. IoT sensors collect patient information, which is then analyzed with machine learning (ML) programs. In this chapter, we present a novel and intelligent healthcare monitoring system based on cutting-edge technologies like the IoT, optimization methods, and machine learning, with the goal of providing early and accurate diagnosis of a wide range of diseases. In this section, we examine the pros and cons of several IoT and ML-based healthcare monitoring systems. ML strategies are utilized to make predictions based on the medical sensor data that has been uploaded to the cloud. Using data from the UCI repository, this chapter describes the common frameworks for developing AI-based machine learning techniques for the Internet of Things. When compared to conventional methods, the proposed IoT-ONN model is 4-15 percentage points more precise. In addition, the IoT-ONN model cuts training time by 15% to 52% compared to ANNs trained with the BPN algorithm. Results show that when various healthcare data sets are utilized for training, the proposed IoT-ONN model performs well in terms of accuracy. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Arun Kumar, Sumit Chakravarty, Aravinda K., and Mohit Kumar Sharma; individual chapters, the contributors.

AB  - Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors integrated in wearable devices offer the potential to monitor arterial blood pressure (ABP) in patients. Such cuffless, non-invasive, and continuous solution is suitable for remote and ambulatory monitoring. A machine learning model based on PPG signal can be used to detect hypertension, estimate beat-by-beat ABP values, and even reconstruct the shape of the ABP. Overall, models presented in literature have shown good performance, but there is a gap between research and potential real-world use cases. Usually, models are trained and tested on data from the same dataset and same subjects, which may lead to overestimating their accuracy. In this paper: we compare cross-validation, where the test data are from the same dataset as training data, and external validation, where the model is tested on samples from a new dataset, on a regression model which predicts diastolic blood pressure from PPG features. The results show that, in the cross-validation, the predicted and the real values are linearly dependent, while in the external validation, the predicted values are not related to the real ones, but probably just through an average value. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Flexible capacitive pressure sensors as one of the crucial sensing components have aroused widespread concern because of their vital role in development of wearable artificial devices, healthcare biomonitoring and human-machine interface. However, there has been a considerable challenge to successfully fabricate them with a tradeoff between high sensitivity and wide sensing range by low-cost and convenient manufacturing methods. Herein, the orientated thermoplastic polyurethane elastomer rubber nanofiber membranes (TPU-O NMs) were prepared via conjugated electrospinning to build a dielectric layer for the flexible capacitive wide-range pressure sensors with high sensitivity. In addition, polyaniline (PANI) was in situ polymerized on the TPU-O NMs as flexible electrodes to maintain the conductive pathway, flexibility, and breathability of the sensors. The TPU@PANI NMs form a bamboo-raft-like microstructure between the aligned fibers under pressure, resulting in a significant increase in sensitivity and working range. Furthermore, the conductive TPU@PANI NMs can be stretched to 1600% without fracture. The assembled sensor has a high sensitivity of 31.73 kPa−1 and a fast response/recovery time of 96 ms. Meantime, it also exhibits a minimum detection limit of 1 Pa, an excellent stability of 10,000 cycles, and a good linearity in a broad working age (1 Pa∼122.5 kPa). Finally, the capacitive pressure sensor was successfully applied for full-range detection of human motions, such as finger bending, joint bending, and even boxing movements. Hence this highly sensitive and wide-range pressure sensor can be a promising candidate for healthcare monitoring, motion recognition, and wearable circuitry in artificial intelligence. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - Telemedicine and remote patient monitoring (RPM) systems have been gaining interest and received adaptation in healthcare sectors since the COVID-19 pandemic due to their efficiency and capability to deliver timely healthcare services while containing COVID-19 transmission. These systems were developed using the latest technology in wireless sensors, medical devices, cloud computing, mobile computing, telecommunications, and machine learning technologies. In this article, a real-time remote patient monitoring system is proposed with an accessible, compact, accurate, and low-cost design. The implemented system is designed to an end-to-end communication interface between medical practitioners and patients. The objective of this study is to provide remote healthcare services to patients who need ongoing care or those who have been discharged from the hospital without affecting their daily routines. The developed monitoring system was then evaluated on 1177 records from MIMIC-III clinical dataset (aged between 19 and 99 years). The performance analysis of the proposed system achieved 88.7% accuracy in generating alerts with logistic regression classification algorithm. This result reflects positively on the quality and robustness of the proposed study. Since the processing time of the proposed system is less than 2 minutes, it can be stated that the system has a high computational speed and is convenient to use in real-time monitoring. Furthermore, the proposed system will fulfil to cover the lower doctor-to-patient ratio by monitoring patients from remote locations and aged people who reside in their residences. © 2023 Htet Yamin Ko Ko et al.

AB  - The Intelligent Hybrid Model for energy efficiency on Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) has gained substantial attention for its potential to enable remote monitoring and healthcare applications. However, energy efficiency remains a crucial challenge in the design and operation of WBANs due to the constrained resources of wearable devices and the need for continuous operation. In this research paper, we recommend an intelligent hybrid framework for energy efficiency in WBANs. The model combines the benefits of two key techniques: dynamic duty cycling and machine learning-based optimization. By intelligently adapting the duty cycle of individual sensor nodes based on their activity levels and environmental context, the proposed framework may optimize energy consumption while maintaining reliable data transmission. Additionally, machine learning algorithms are used, that can also help in the prediction of sensor node activity patterns and optimize duty cycle settings in real-time. The intelligent hybrid framework may achieve significant energy savings that extend the WBAN devices' lifetime and also enhance their reliability for critical healthcare applications. The proposed model holds the potential to revolutionize the energy efficiency paradigm in WBANs, paving the way for widespread adoption and deployment in various healthcare and remote monitoring scenarios.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Background: Central nervous system (CNS) disorders benefit from ongoing monitoring to assess disease progression and treatment efficacy. Mobile health (mHealth) technologies offer a means for the remote and continuous symptom monitoring of patients. Machine Learning (ML) techniques can process and engineer mHealth data into a precise and multidimensional biomarker of disease activity. Objective: This narrative literature review aims to provide an overview of the current landscape of biomarker development using mHealth technologies and ML. Additionally, it proposes recommendations to ensure the accuracy, reliability, and interpretability of these biomarkers. Methods: This review extracted relevant publications from databases such as PubMed, IEEE, and CTTI. The ML methods employed across the selected publications were then extracted, aggregated, and reviewed. Results: This review synthesized and presented the diverse approaches of 66 publications that address creating mHealth-based biomarkers using ML. The reviewed publications provide a foundation for effective biomarker development and offer recommendations for creating representative, reproducible, and interpretable biomarkers for future clinical trials. Conclusion: mHealth-based and ML-derived biomarkers have great potential for the remote monitoring of CNS disorders. However, further research and standardization of study designs are needed to advance this field. With continued innovation, mHealth-based biomarkers hold promise for improving the monitoring of CNS disorders. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - (1) Background: We present the protocol of a randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the benefit of a novel clinical decision support system for the management of patients with COVID-19. (2) Methods: The study will recruit up to 500 participants (250 cases and 250 controls). Both groups will receive the conventional telephone follow-up protocol by primary care and will also be provided with access to a mobile application, in which they will be able to report their symptoms three times a day. In addition, patients in the active group will receive a wearable smartwatch and a pulse oximeter at home for real-time monitoring. The measured data will be visualized by primary care and emergency health service professionals, allowing them to detect in real time the progression and complications of the disease in order to promote early therapeutic interventions based on their clinical judgement. (3) Results: Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the Drug Research Ethics Committee of the Valladolid East Health Area (CASVE-NM-21-516). The results obtained from this study will form part of the thesis of two PhD students and will be disseminated through publication in a peer-reviewed journal. (4) Conclusions: The implementation of this telemonitoring system can be extrapolated to patients with other similar diseases, such as chronic diseases, with a high prevalence and need for close monitoring. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Background: The availability and effectiveness of Digital Health Technologies (DHTs) to support clinicians, empower patients, and generate economic savings for national healthcare systems are growing rapidly. Of particular promise is the capacity of DHTs to autonomously facilitate remote monitoring and treatment. Diabetic Foot Ulcers (DFUs) are characterised by high rates of infection, amputation, mortality, and healthcare costs. With clinical outcomes contingent on activities that can be readily monitored, DFUs present a promising focus for the application of remote DHTs. Objective: This scoping review has been conducted as a first step toward ascertaining fthe data-related challenges and opportunities for the development of more comprehensive, integrated, and individualised sense/act DHTs. We review the latest developments in the application of DHTs to the remote care of DFUs. We cover the types of DHTs in development and their features, technological readiness, and scope of clinical testing. Eligibility criteria: Only peer-reviewed original experimental and observational studies, case series and qualitative studies were included in literature searches. All reviews and manuscripts presenting pre-trial prototype technologies were excluded. Methods: An initial search of three databases (Web of Science, MEDLINE, and Scopus) generated 1,925 English-language papers for screening. 388 papers were assessed as eligible for full-text screening by the review team. 81 manuscripts were found to meet the eligibility criteria. Results: Only 19% of studies incorporated multiple DHTs. We categorised 56% of studies as ‘Treatment-Manual’, i.e. studies involving technologies aimed at treatment requiring manual data generation, and 26% as ‘Prevention-Autonomous’, i.e. studies of technologies generating data autonomously through wearable sensors aimed at ulcer prevention through patient behavioural change. Only 10% of studies involved more ambitious ‘Treatment-Autonomous’ interventions. We found that studies generally reported high levels of patient adherence and satisfaction. Conclusions: Our findings point to a major potential role for DHTs in remote personalised medical management of DFUs. However, larger studies are required to assess their impact. Here, we see opportunities for developing much larger, more comprehensive, and integrated monitoring and decision support systems with the potential to address the disease in a more complete context by capturing and integrating data from multiple sources from subjective and objective measurements.

AB  - Background: Patients with chronic respiratory diseases and those in the postdischarge period following hospitalization because of COVID-19 are particularly vulnerable, and little is known about the changes in their symptoms and physiological parameters. Continuous remote monitoring of physiological parameters and symptom changes offers the potential for timely intervention, improved patient outcomes, and reduced health care costs. Objective: This study investigated whether a real-time multimodal program using commercially available wearable technology, home-based Bluetooth-enabled spirometers, finger pulse oximeters, and smartphone apps is feasible and acceptable for patients with chronic respiratory diseases, as well as the value of low-burden, long-term passive data collection. Methods: In a 3-arm prospective observational cohort feasibility study, we recruited 60 patients from the Royal Free Hospital and University College Hospital. These patients had been diagnosed with interstitial lung disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or post–COVID-19 condition (n=20 per group) and were followed for 180 days. This study used a comprehensive remote monitoring system designed to provide real-time and relevant data for both patients and clinicians. Data were collected using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture; Vanderbilt University) periodic surveys, Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapses–base active app questionnaires, wearables, finger pulse oximeters, smartphone apps, and Bluetooth home-based spirometry. The feasibility of remote monitoring was measured through adherence to the protocol, engagement during the follow-up period, retention rate, acceptability, and data integrity. Results: Lowest-burden passive data collection methods, via wearables, demonstrated superior adherence, engagement, and retention compared with active data collection methods, with an average wearable use of 18.66 (SD 4.69) hours daily (77.8% of the day), 123.91 (SD 33.73) hours weekly (72.6% of the week), and 463.82 (SD 156.70) hours monthly (64.4% of the month). Highest-burden spirometry tasks and high-burden active app tasks had the lowest adherence, engagement, and retention, followed by low-burden questionnaires. Spirometry and active questionnaires had the lowest retention at 0.5 survival probability, indicating that they were the most burdensome. Adherence to and quality of home spirometry were analyzed; of the 7200 sessions requested, 4248 (59%) were performed. Of these, 90.3% (3836/4248) were of acceptable quality according to American Thoracic Society grading. Inclusion of protocol holidays improved retention measures. The technologies used were generally well received. Conclusions: Our findings provide evidence supporting the feasibility and acceptability of remote monitoring for capturing both subjective and objective data from various sources for respiratory diseases. The high engagement level observed with passively collected data suggests the potential of wearables for long-term, user-friendly remote monitoring in respiratory disease management. The unique piloting of certain features such as protocol holidays, alert notifications for missing data, and flexible support from the study team provides a reference for future studies in this field. © Malik A Althobiani, Yatharth Ranjan, Joseph Jacob, Michele Orini, Richard James Butler Dobson, Joanna C Porter, John R Hurst, Amos A Folarin.

AB  - Background: Innovative models of health care that involve advanced technology in the form of a digital hospital are emerging globally. Models include technology such as machine learning and smart wearables, that can be used to integrate patient data and improve continuity of care. This model may have benefits in situations where patient deterioration must be detected quickly so that a rapid response can occur such as cardiopulmonary settings. Aim: The purpose of this scoping review was to examine the evidence for a digital hospital model of care, in the context of cardiac and pulmonary settings. Design: Scoping review. Data sources: Databases searched were using PsycInfo, Ovid MEDLINE, and CINAHL. Studies written in English and containing key terms related to digital hospital and cardiopulmonary care were included. The Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for systematic reviews was used to assess the risk of bias. Results: Thirteen (13) studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. For cardiac conditions, a deep-learning-based rapid response system warning system for predicting patient deterioration leading to cardiac arrest had up to 257% higher sensitivity than conventional methods. There was also a reduction in the number of patients who needed to be examined by a physician. Using continuous telemonitoring with a wireless real-time electrocardiogram compared with non-monitoring, there was improved initial resuscitation and 24-hour post-event survival for high-risk patients. However, there were no benefits for survival to discharge. For pulmonary conditions, a natural language processing algorithm reduced the time to asthma diagnosis, demonstrating high predictive values. Virtual inhaler education was found to be as effective as in-person education, and prescription error was reduced following the implementation of computer-based physician order entry electronic medical records and a clinical decision support tool.

AB  - Ischemic heart disease (IHD), a critical and dreadful cardiovascular disease, is a leading cause of death globally. The steady progress of IHD leads to an irreversible condition called myocardial infarction (MI). The detection of MI can be done by observing the altered electrocardiogram (ECG) characteristics. Often, automated ECG analysis is preferred in place of visual inspection to reduce time and ensure reliable detection even when the recording quality is not very good. This paper presents an automated approach to classify recent MI, past MI, and normal sinus rhythm (NSR) classes based on the morphological features of the ECG. In clinical practice, a standard 12-lead ECG setup is typically employed to identify MI. However, acquiring a 12-lead ECG is not always convenient. Hence, in this study, we have explored the possibility of using a minimal number of ECG leads by deriving the augmented limb leads using leads I and II. A well-known and widely used ensemble machine learning tool, the random forest (RF) classifier is trained using features extracted from the derived augmented limb leads and their combinations. An RF classifier built using features extracted from all limb leads has outperformed classifiers built on combinations of them with five-fold cross-validation training accuracy of 97.9 (±0.008) % and testing accuracy of 98 %.Clinical relevance-As high sensitivity is reported in identifying recent MI and past MI classes, the proposed approach is suitable for preventative healthcare applications since it is less likely that subjects with recent or past MI will be misclassified. Due to its low computational complexity, better interpretability, and comparable performance to the state-of-the-art results, the proposed approach can be employed in clinical and cardiac health screening applications. It also has the potential to be employed in remote monitoring with mobile and wearable devices because it is built on features extracted from only lead I and II ECG recordings. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has revolutionised healthcare by allowing for remote monitoring and diagnosis of patients through medical devices. Medical image classification is essential for IoMT applications, as it enables early detection of diseases and personalised treatments. However, single-phase classification models face challenges distinguishing between similar conditions and differentiating them from normal cases. To address these challenges, this research proposes a Machine Learning-based Multi-Phase Medical Image Classification (ML-MPMIC) model that combines image segmentation and classification techniques to achieve higher accuracy in disease diagnosis. The proposed model is evaluated through simulation analysis and parameter optimisation. The proposed ML-MPMIC approach has high accuracy, precision, F score, and Low Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values and its potential to improve healthcare outcomes in IoMT applications  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - With the rise of artificial intelligence, sensor-based human activity recognition (S-HAR) is increasingly being employed in healthcare monitoring for the elderly, fitness tracking, and patient rehabilitation using smart devices. Inertial sensors have been commonly used for S-HAR, but wearable devices have been demanding more comfort and flexibility in recent years. Consequently, there has been an effort to incorporate stretch sensors into S-HAR with the advancement of flexible electronics technology. This paper presents a deep learning network model, utilizing aggregation residual transformation, that can efficiently extract spatial–temporal features and perform activity classification. The efficacy of the suggested model was assessed using the w-HAR dataset, which included both inertial and stretch sensor data. This dataset was used to train and test five fundamental deep learning models (CNN, LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, and BiGRU), along with the proposed model. The primary objective of the w-HAR investigations was to determine the feasibility of utilizing stretch sensors for recognizing human actions. Additionally, this study aimed to explore the effectiveness of combining data from both inertial and stretch sensors in S-HAR. The results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in enhancing HAR using inertial and stretch sensors. The deep learning model we presented achieved an impressive accuracy of 97.68%. Notably, our method outperformed existing approaches and demonstrated excellent generalization capabilities. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - The eHealth systems are in great demand, particularly during times of outbreak like COVID-19, when there is a shortage of caregivers. The technological advancements, such as wearable wireless devices, the Internet of Things, and improved machine learning methods have made these systems more reliable. In modern times, these systems can play a vital role in post-rehabilitation journeys, which have significant social impact and high costs in traditional settings. Cost efficiency, portability, and generalization are key factors in adopting new technology. In this study, we investigate the potential for optimizing and simplifying hardware in order to increase the cost-effectiveness and versatility of post-stroke eHealth rehabilitation systems. It leverages the rich information available from Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors to compensate the need for foot pressure sensing. We present the first attempt to demonstrate the potential of machine learning, aided by affordable off the shelf motion sensing devices, for foot pressure analysis. Our proposed foot pressure decoding model is trained in an exercise-agnostic, self-supervised manner that eliminates the need for human annotation. The algorithm is evaluated using appropriate performance metrics, and our experimental results show very promising performance. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Ubiquitous devices, such as smartphones and wearables, are becoming increasingly popular for monitoring user behavior, health, and well-being. Through omnipresent monitoring, they aim to raise user awareness and encourage positive health behavior change. Yet, ubiquitous technologies suffer from expectation mismatch, lack of user-centric adaptiveness, and, ultimately, high abandonment rates. This work is motivated by the vital need to tailor and personalize ubiquitous technologies while dealing with the challenges arising from the lack of user profiling and the absence of relevant, self-reported user data. To this end, we show that the automatically passively collected sensing data from the wearables can be exploited to improve personalization and infer several user states relevant to demographic, physiological, psychological, and personality aspects, complementing the need for time-consuming self-reports. To accomplish this task, and enable the reproducibility and extensibility of our work; we propose an extensive benchmark suite by exploiting sensing data harvested from ubiquitous devices.Our benchmark covers a wide range of personalization tasks, including modeling gender, age, personality states, and stress, experimenting on the publicly available, newly released LifeSnaps dataset containing over 71 million rows of data capturing the daily lives of 71 participants in their naturalistic environments. The proposed benchmarking continuum showcases the strong potential for the applicability of the presented work in critical applications, such as mental healthcare monitoring, privacy preservation, and responsible artificial intelligence (AI), by fostering fairness assessments when protected attribute knowledge is unavailable. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - The framework presented in this article provides a guide for designing secure and sustainable internet of medical things (IoMT) solutions. The main objective is to address the challenges related to safety and sustainability in the medical field. The critical conditions driving these challenges are identified, and future trends in the field of IoMT are discussed. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed framework, a case study was carried out in a private medical clinic. In this study, an IoMT system was implemented to monitor patients’ vital signs, even when they were not in the clinic. The positive results demonstrated that the implemented IoMT system met the established security and sustainability requirements. The main statistical findings of the case study include the real-time monitoring of the vital signs of the patients, which improved the quality of care and allowed for the early detection of possible complications. In addition, medical devices such as the blood pressure monitor, pulse oximeter, and electrocardiograph were selected, proving safe, durable, and energy and maintenance efficient. These results were consistent with previous research that had shown the benefits of IoMT in remote monitoring, the early detection of health problems, and improved medical decision-making. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - In an effort to digitalize and modernize medical equipment maintenance services in Government Hospitals, remote monitoring dashboard has become indispensable. Monitoring dashboards are often used to monitor, control, improve and maintain the operations of medical equipment as they are a powerful tool that provides an overview of the current status of the operating system. This paper presents the design development of a Remote Monitoring Predictive Maintenance Dashboard via web-based application for the Reverse Osmosis (RO) Water Purification System at Hospital Temenggong Seri Maharaja Tun Ibrahim, Johor, Malaysia. The dashboard monitors real-time data captured from nine sensors located in the RO plant. The real-time data is processed for breakdown prediction of the plant by incorporating the long short-term memory (LSTM) network which will be displayed on the dashboard and produced an alert when necessary. The system development approach practices the 'Waterfall Method' with a combination of the 'Agile Method'. This paper discusses the system requirement specifications, system architecture, system functions and the outcome of the development. The system has been successfully deployed and tested by the stakeholders.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - The need for remote healthcare monitoring systems that utilize limited resources' biosensors is growing. These biosensors increase the amount of transmitted data across the Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT) network. Therefore, it is necessary to decrease the transmitted data and make a decision at the edge gateway to save the energy of the biosensors and produce a quick response for the medical staff. This paper proposes an energy-efficient multisensor adaptive sampling and aggregation (EMASA) for patient monitoring in edge computing-based IoHT networks. In the edge-based IoHT network, EMASA operates on two levels: biosensors and the edge gateway. Each biosensor removes the redundant sensed data using the local emergency detection and sampling rate adaptation algorithms. In the edge gateway, it implements a machine learning-based Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to provide a suitable decision about the status of the monitored patient. We accomplished various examinations using real data from the patients' biosensors. According to the simulation results, EMASA reduced the size of transmitted data from 93.5% to 99% and saved 78.35% of energy when compared to a previous study. It keeps the whole score with a good representation at the Edge gateway and provides accurate and fast decisions based on the patient's condition. © 2023-IOS Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - The paper articulates an exploration into the integration of wearable devices for remote patient data monitoring, which marks a transformative shift in healthcare practices. This transition is underscored by user-centric interfaces and applications, enabling convenient remote monitoring. However, the escalating concern of patient data vulnerability to network breaches presents a substantial impediment. In response, we introduce the proposed scheme that harnesses Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques. The main objective of the proposed scheme is to meet the exacting requirements of healthcare systems, aiming to fortify data integrity and confidentiality. Within this context, the proposed scheme unveils a sophisticated DL-driven detection model, adeptly tailored for discerning and countering data manipulation endeavors through a nuanced multi-label classification paradigm. Notably, the emphasis lies on safeguarding patient data privacy and security, which is paramount in today's information-rich landscape. The narrative seamlessly interweaves elements of wearable technology, sensor networks, advanced DL capabilities, and robust security measures, resulting in an innovative scheme. Finally, the proposed scheme is evaluated against various metrics such as accuracy and loss curve and F1, recall, and precision comparison. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - In social IoMT systems, resource-constrained devices face the challenges of limited computation, bandwidth, and privacy in the deployment of deep learning models. Federated learning (FL) is one of the solutions to user privacy and provides distributed training among several local devices. In addition, it reduces the computation and bandwidth of transferring videos to the central server in camera-based IoMT devices. In this work, we design an edge-based federated framework for such devices. In contrast to traditional methods that drop the resource-constrained stragglers in a federated round, our system provides a methodology to incorporate them. We propose a new phase in the FL algorithm, known as split learning. The stragglers train collaboratively with the nearest edge node using split learning. We test the implementation using heterogeneous computing devices that extract vital signs from videos. The results show a reduction of 3.6 h in the training time of videos using the split learning phase with respect to the traditional approach. We also evaluate the performance of the devices and system with key parameters, CPU utilization, memory consumption, and data rate. Furthermore, we achieve 87.29% and 60.26% test accuracy at the nonstragglers and stragglers, respectively, with a global accuracy of 90.32% at the server. Therefore, FedCare provides a straggler-resistant federated method for a heterogeneous system for social IoMT devices.  © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a non-invasive technique for recording human vital signs. PPG is normally recorded by wearable devices that are prone to artifacts. This results in signal corruption that decreases measurement accuracy. Thus, a signal quality assessment (SQA) system is essential in obtaining reliable measurements. Conventionally, SQA is mainly driven by human-knowledge and supervised through experts' annotations. However, they are not tailored for the particularities of the domain applications. Hence, we propose a machine-aided SQA framework that generates respective quality criteria for applications. By using the proposed approach, quality criteria can be easily trained for different applications. Then, quality assessment can be applied to several PPG-based physiological signals telemonitoring. Compared with conventional approaches, the proposed system has a higher rejection rate for high-error signals and a lower mean absolute error is achieved when estimating heart rate (-3.06 BPM), determining respiration rate (-1.36 BPM), and predicting hypertension (+24%). The proposed method enhances accuracy in monitoring physiological signals and thus is suitable for healthcare applications.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has been proven to be effective in various healthcare and telemonitoring applications. Current HAR methods, especially deep learning, are extensively employed owing to their exceptional recognition capabilities. However, in pursuit of enhancing feature expression abilities, deep learning often introduces a trade-off by increasing Time complexity. Moreover, the intricate nature of human activity data poses a challenge as it can lead to a notable decrease in recognition accuracy when affected by additional noise. These aspects will significantly impair recognition performance. To advance this field further, we present a HAR method based on an edge-computing-assisted and GRU deep-learning network. We initially proposed a model for edge computing to optimize the energy consumption and processing time of wearable devices. This model transmits HAR data to edge-computable nodes, deploys analytical models on edge servers for remote training, and returns results to wearable devices for processing. Then, we introduced an initial convolution method to preprocess large amounts of training data more effectively. To this end, an attention mechanism was integrated into the network structure to enhance the analysis of confusing data and improve the accuracy of action classification. Our results demonstrated that the proposed approach achieved an average accuracy of 85.4% on the 200 difficult-to-identify HAR data, which outperforms the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) method’s accuracy of 77.1%. The experimental results showcase the efficacy of the proposed method and offer valuable insights for the future application of HAR. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Electrocardiograms (ECGs) provide crucial information for evaluating a patient’s cardiovascular health; however, they are not always easily accessible. Photoplethysmography (PPG), a technology commonly used in wearable devices such as smartwatches, has shown promise for constructing ECGs. Several methods have been proposed for ECG reconstruction using PPG signals, but some require signal alignment during the training phase, which is not feasible in real-life settings where ECG signals are not collected at the same time as PPG signals. To address this challenge, we introduce PPG2ECGps, an end-to-end, patient-specific deep-learning neural network utilizing the W-Net architecture. This novel approach enables direct ECG signal reconstruction from PPG signals, eliminating the need for signal alignment. Our experiments show that the proposed model achieves mean values of 0.977 mV for Pearson’s correlation coefficient, 0.037 mV for the root mean square error, and 0.010 mV for the normalized dynamic time-warped distance when comparing reconstructed ECGs to reference ECGs from a dataset of 500 records. As PPG signals are more accessible than ECG signals, our proposed model has significant potential to improve patient monitoring and diagnosis in healthcare settings via wearable devices. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Athletes who push their bodies to the limit need to be in tip-top shape to compete. Before engaging in strenuous activity or competition, they should focus on building a healthy body. The ubiquitous availability of smartphones, recent advancements in computational, and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, and the rising trends in multimedia and edge computation have all contributed to the emergence of new models and paradigms for wearable devices. Researchers have provided a diverse array of analytical methodologies centering on athlete health; however, neural networks have been applied in just a fraction of the completed investigations. Using recurrent neural networks and wearable technology, we offer a new method for forecasting the health of football players. One of the earliest uses of wearable sensors for athletes’ training and health, the suggested system keeps tabs on the players’ well-being in real time. After feeding the time-step data into a recurrent neural network (RNN) and extracting deep features from it, a set of health prediction results is returned. This study involves a number of experiments, the results of which are dependent on the players’ health data. The proposed method is shown to be practical and reliable through simulation results. The study’s algorithms can form the basis of data-driven monitoring and instruction. The chapter finishes with a discussion of potential research approaches and future directions for the smart wearables sector. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Arun Kumar, Sumit Chakravarty, Aravinda K., and Mohit Kumar Sharma; individual chapters, the contributors.

AB  - AI and IoT can revolutionize patient care and monitoring. This presentation discusses the pros and cons of using AI and IoT to enhance patient care, therapy, and remote patient monitoring. AI technology improve data analysis, predictive modeling, and decision-making while IoT devices simplify patient data collecting and transfer. These technologies may enhance treatment regimens, patient results, and insights. AI and IoT let healthcare practitioners remotely monitor patients. Wearable sensors, remote monitoring devices, and implantable devices may collect vital signs, activity levels, and other health data from patients. Then, real-time artificial intelligence systems may analyze the data for quicker diagnosis, better treatment, and better results. AI-enhanced predictive analytics may help doctors identify patterns and trends in patient data for early diagnosis, risk assessment, and prevention. Machine learning algorithms can predict disease development, adjust medication dosages, and identify potential adverse events to enhance patient safety and treatment efficacy. However, healthcare AI and IoT use raises concerns that must be addressed. The massive volumes of patient data collected and transferred pose data security and privacy concerns. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and patient privacy must be observed. Data integration, standardization, and compatibility are some of the technical challenges of IoT device and AI system integration. Healthcare firms need robust infrastructure and data management to network, share data, and collaborate across devices and systems.

AB  - 2D materials have attracted considerable attention in the past decade for their superlative physical properties. Lightweight foam from 2D materials can reduce the use of raw materials, save energy in processing the material and downregulate the carbon emission. Self-assembling of graphene nanosheets results in 3D porous lightweight foam resembling hydrogels, aerogels, and xerogels. Hierarchical graphene architecture provides an uninterrupted path to electrons and phonon transport conforms to eligibility for developing sensor, energy storage, and energy conversion devices. Artificial intelligence (AI) originates from human–machine interaction and physiological signal reception which requires a large sensing range that illustrates to healthcare surveillance with wearable devices. Spongy architectures with flexibility and reversible compressibility act as a good candidate for pressure sensing for a wide range of real-time human health monitoring systems by using artificial intelligence. In this review, the new perspective of emerging 2D materials (such as MXene, and borophene) along with the investigation of the graphene foam structure is demonstrated. Electrosorption of salt-ions under foam electrode are reviewed in the context of electrochemical stability recycling ability, and efficiency of adsorption-desorption. Beyond these, remaining challenges are depicted for emerging 2D-materials of interest for health monitoring sensors and flexible supercapacitors for promising research directions. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Remote health monitoring (RHM) uses cutting-edge technologies to offer better-quality healthcare service to patients as well as to make the task of healthcare providers easier. Over the past few years, the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has shown huge potential for the sector’s growth, creating much research interest and commercial investment. Many research studies and developments have offered innovative personalised healthcare services via RHM with the help of IoMT. This chapter aims to provide readers with the necessary background information on the IoMT in RHM. We introduce the major types of RHM, namely, remote diagnosis, remote healthcare consultation and remote patient monitoring, and also provide the general architecture of IoMT for RHM. Then, we present a brief overview of various hardware-based technologies that are playing a key role in RHM, such as medical sensors and smart devices. After that, we briefly review the infrastructure and software technologies, such as 5G, cloud, fog, artificial intelligence, machine learning and blockchain, which are being used to broaden the field of IoMT and shape its future. Subsequently, this chapter discusses the benefits that the IoMT can bring to RHM and the challenges to overcome in order to take full advantage of IoMT in RHM. Finally, we present three representative case studies of RHM developed with the help of IoMT to give readers a better understanding of the sophisticated technologies used in such environments to deliver enhanced and efficient service. © 2024 Rajiv Pandey, Pratibha Maurya and Raymond Chiong.

AB  - The rapid adoption of digital health technologies generates a vast amount of health data, presenting an opportunity to leverage advanced data analytics and cognitive computing to extract insights and knowledge from this data and improve healthcare outcomes. This research presents an integrated deep learning (DL) and natural language processing (NLP) approach for continuous remote monitoring in digital health. The approach involves using DL algorithms to analyze data collected from wearable devices and remote monitoring tools, while NLP is used to analyze patient feedback and electronic medical records. Various DL algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), are suggested to analyze medical images and time-series data, and unsupervised learning techniques, such as autoencoders, are recommended for feature extraction. We provide a comparison between our proposed approach and previous related works. We also identify and discuss the limitations of existing works and explain how our approach overcomes these limitations. The study also delivers a review of the prevailing work of data analytics and cognitive computing in digital health, examining the applications of these technologies in various areas of healthcare, identifying the challenges and opportunities of implementing them in healthcare, and proposing research directions that can help accelerate their adoption. The proposed approach can enable health professionals to remotely monitor patients’ health conditions in real-time and predict the likelihood of adverse health events, leading to improved patient outcomes, reduced healthcare costs, and enhanced quality of care. This paper provides insights into current trends, challenges, and research directions in digital health, informing future research and development. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - To develop intelligent wearable protection systems is of great significance to human health engineering. An ideal intelligent air filtration system should possess reliable filtration efficiency, low pressure drop, healthcare monitoring function, and man-machine interactive capability. However, no existing intelligent protection system covers all these essential aspects. Herein, we developed an intelligent wearable filtration system (IWFS) via advanced nanotechnology and machine learning. Based on the triboelectric mechanism, the fabricated IWFS exhibits a long-lasting high particle filtration efficiency and bacteria protection efficiency of 99% and 100%, respectively, with a low-pressure drop of 5.8 mmH2O. Correspondingly, the charge accumulation of the optimized IWFS (87 nC) increased to 3.5 times that of the pristine nanomesh, providing a significant enhancement of the particle filtration efficiency. Theoretical principles, including the enhancement of the β-phase and the lower surface potential of the modified nanomesh, were quantitatively investigated by molecular dynamics simulation, band theory, and Kelvin probe force microscopy. Furthermore, we endowed the IWFS with a healthcare monitoring function and man-machine interactive capability through machine learning and wireless transmission technology. Crucial physiological signals of people, including breath, cough, and speaking signals, were detected and classified, with a high recognition rate of 92%; the fabricated IWFS can collect healthcare data and transmit voice commands in real time without hindrance by portable electronic devices. The achieved IWFS not only has practical significance for human health management but also has great theoretical value for advanced wearable systems. © 2023 American Chemical Society

AB  - Considering the increasing growth of communicable diseases worldwide such as COVID-19, it is recommended to stay at home for patients with fewer chronic health problems. In recent times, the high chance of COVID-19 spread and the lack of an excellent remote monitoring system make the situation challenging for hospital administrators. Inspired by these challenges, in this paper, we develop a new edge-centric healthcare framework for remote health monitoring and disease prediction using Wearable Sensors (WSs) and advanced Machine Learning (ML) model, namely Bag-of-Neural Network (BoNN), respectively. The epidemic model collects the health symptoms of the patient using various a set of WSs and preprocesses the data in distributed edge devices for preparing a useful dataset. Finally, the proposed BoNN model is applied over the refined dataset for detecting COVID-19 disease at centralized cloud servers using a set of random neural networks. To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed BoNN model over the standard ML models, the system is fine-tuned and trained over a synthetic COVID-19 dataset before being evaluated on a benchmark Brazil COVID-19 dataset using various performance metrics. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed BoNN model achieves 99.8% accuracy while analyzing the Brazil dataset. © 2001-2012 IEEE.

AB  - The rapid increase in population density in urban cities has created a demand for suitable infrastructure and services to meet the needs of urban residents. To address this demand, urban planners and developers are turning to data science for assistance in creating smart city solutions. The Internet of Things (IoT) has played a significant role in the application of data science in urban planning, as IoT devices such as sensors and smart devices provide vast amounts of data that can be used to gain insights into the operations of the city and make data-driven decisions to enhance its productivity, efficiency, and overall quality of life. This paper provides a general overview of data science in urban planning for smart city development. It highlights the importance of data science in urban planning and the role it plays in creating smarter, more effective cities. By applying data analytics, machine learning, and other data science approaches, urban planners can gain insights into various aspects of urban life, including traffic patterns, energy usage, and public safety. These insights can then be used to develop strategies that improve traffic flow, reduce energy waste, and enhance overall quality of life in cities. The study aims to describe the function of data science in urban planning, examine case studies and best practices, discuss the challenges and limitations associated with applying data science in urban planning, and provide suggestions for further research and advancements in the field. By investigating how data science can be effectively used in urban planning for smart city development, this study contributes to the growing body of knowledge on creating more sustainable and livable cities.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Cells provide structure and function for all living things, from microorganisms to humans. Scientists consider them the smallest form of life. Cells house the biological machinery that makes the proteins, chemicals, and signals responsible for everything that happens inside the bodies. Cells come in different shapes-round, flat, long, star-like, cubed, and even shapeless. Most cells are colorless and see-through. The size of a cell also varies. When putting cells into categories, scientists can tell eukaryotic cells apart from prokaryotic cells because they look different. Eukaryotic cells make up animals, plants, fungi, and some single-celled organisms. Many types of cells can move. Single-celled organisms move to find food. And even cells inside multicellular organisms may need to get around. Cell biologists rely on an array of tools to peer into the body and examine cells. One cell divides into two in a process called mitosis. Mitosis produces two genetically identical “daughter” cells from a single parent cell. © 2023 Jenny Stanford Publishing Pte. Ltd.

AB  - In this work, we propose SemBox - Semantic interoperability in a Box, to enable wireless on-the-go communication between heterogeneous wearable health monitoring devices. It can connect wirelessly to the health monitoring devices and receive their data packets. It uses a Mamdani-based fuzzy inference system with data pre-processing to classify the received data packet into one of the classes of the vital parameters. It enables semantic interoperability by labelling and annotating the data packets based on the extracted packet information. We implement SemBox using three different health monitoring wearables, with different keywords used for each vital parameter representation in the data packet. SemBox shows a maximum classification accuracy of 85.71%, with a maximum PDR of 1 at the SemBox with varying device parameters. Overall, SemBox is a potential plug-and-play solution to achieve semantic interoperability and collaboration between heterogeneous health monitoring wearable devices, irrespective of their commercial and proprietary specifications. It is customizable for applications that use multiple heterogeneous devices for collaborative monitoring and decision support. SemBox enables interoperability among health monitoring devices, introduces flexibility and ease the inter-device dynamics in the domain of biomedical research.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The rise in chronic diseases and the aging of the population led to an increase in the demand for remote healthcare systems that employ biosensors to monitor people's health status. The increasing need for these automated systems has led to the emergence of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) networks. In the IoMT networks, the biosensor devices collect vital signs and transmit them to the gateway for further analysis and fusion. In light of the limited biosensor device resources (power, storage, and computation) and the periodical transmission of a large amount of data, it is necessary to optimize the transmission of data in order to conserve power while maintaining data quality at the gateway. Also, it became important to have a decision-making-based machine learning model at the gateway to evaluate a patient's health and make a quick, accurate decision in case of an emergency. This article proposes multibiosensor data sampling and transmission reduction with decision-making (MuDaSaTReD) for remote patient monitoring in the IoMT networks. The MuDaSaTReD achieves this goal on two levels: biosensors and a fog gateway. It uses an energy-saving lightweight data transmission (ELiDaT) algorithm to get rid of the repeated data and then adapts the sampling rate of each biosensor using an adaptive data sampling (ADaS) algorithm. The Multibiosensor Data Sampling and Transmission Reduction with Decision-making (MuDaFuDeC) implements the machine learning model at the fog gateway to learn and decide the situation of the patient according to the received data from the biosensors. The performance evaluation shows that the MuDaFuDeC outperforms other approaches in terms of the data reduction percentage and energy consumption. It keeps a good representation of all the scores at the fog gateway and makes automated, fast, and accurate decisions based on the patient's condition.  © 2001-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Deep learning models have shown great promise in various healthcare monitoring applications. However, most healthcare datasets with high-quality (gold-standard) labels are small-scale, as directly collecting ground truth is often costly and time-consuming. As a result, models developed and validated on small-scale datasets often suffer from overfitting and do not generalize well to unseen scenarios. At the same time, large amounts of imprecise (silver-standard) labeled data, annotated by approximate methods with the help of modern wearables and in the absence of ground truth validation, are starting to emerge. However, due to measurement differences, this data displays significant label distribution shifts, which motivates the use of domain adaptation. To this end, we introduce UDAMA, a method with two key components: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation and Multi-discriminator Adversarial Training, where we pre-train on the silver-standard data and employ adversarial adaptation with the gold-standard data along with two domain discriminators. In particular, we showcase the practical potential of UDAMA by applying it to Cardio-respiratory fitness (CRF) prediction. CRF is a crucial determinant of metabolic disease and mortality, and it presents labels with various levels of noise (gold- and silver-standard), making it challenging to establish an accurate prediction model. Our results show promising performance by alleviating distribution shifts in various label shift settings. Additionally, by using data from two free-living cohort studies (Fenland and BBVS), we show that UDAMA consistently outperforms up to 12% compared to competitive transfer learning and state-of-the-art domain adaptation models, paving the way for leveraging noisy labeled data to improve fitness estimation at scale. © 2023 Y.

AB  - This study aims to develop machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict exercise exertion levels using physiological parameters collected from wearable devices. Real-time ECG, oxygen saturation, pulse rate, and revolutions per minute (RPM) data were collected at three intensity levels during a 16-minute cycling exercise. Parallel to this, throughout each exercise session, the study subjects' ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) were gathered once per minute. Each 16-minute exercise session was divided into a total of eight 2-minute windows. Each exercise window was labeled as "high exertion," or "low exertion" classes based on the self-reported RPEs. For each window, the gathered ECG data were used to derive the heart rate variability (HRV) features in the temporal and frequency domains. Additionally, each window's averaged RPMs, heart rate, and oxygen saturation levels were calculated to form all the predictive features. The minimum redundancy maximum relevance algorithm was used to choose the best predictive features. Top selected features were then used to assess the accuracy of ten ML classifiers to predict the next window's exertion level. The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) model showed the highest accuracy of 85.7% and the highest F1 score of 83%. An ensemble model showed the highest area under the curve (AUC) of 0.92. The suggested method can be used to automatically track perceived exercise exertion in real-time. ©2023 AMIA - All rights reserved.

AB  - The usage of IoT in the medical field, often referred to as IoMT, plays a vital role in facilitating the exchange of sensitive data among medical devices. This capability significantly contributes to enhancing the quality of patient care. However, it comes with privacy issues that compromise the security of the data collected by medical sensors, making them vulnerable to potential cyber threats such as data modification, replay attacks, etc. These attacks can lead to significant data loss or unauthorized alterations. Machine learning, particularly in cyber-attack detection systems, is crucial for identifying and classifying such attacks. Yet, the main challenge lies in adapting to the dynamic and unpredictable nature of malicious attacks and creating scalable solutions to combat them. The objective of this paper is to detect cybersecurity threats, with a particular focus on man-in-the-middle attacks that occur within the IoMT communication network. The study utilizes principal component analysis (PCA) for feature reduction and employs multi-layer perceptron to classify unforeseen cyber-attack IoT-based healthcare devices. The study evaluates the effectiveness of this proposed strategy using real-time data from the St. Louis Enhanced Healthcare Monitoring System (WUSTL-EHMS). The findings indicate that the multi-layer perceptron outperforms other tested classifiers, achieving an accuracy score of 96.39%, while also improving the performance by reducing the time complexity. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Wearable devices and mobile sensors enable the real-time collection of an abundant source of physiological and behavioural data unobtrusively. Unlike traditional in-person evaluation or ecological momentary assessment (EMA) questionnaire-based approaches, these data sources open many possibilities in remote patient monitoring. However, defining robust models is challenging due to the data's noisy and frequently missing observations. This work proposes an attention-based Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network-based pipeline for predicting mobility impairment based on WHODAS 2.0 evaluation from such digital biomarkers. Furthermore, we addressed the missing observation problem by utilising hidden Markov models and the possibility of including information from unlabelled samples via transfer learning. We validated our approach using two wearable/mobile sensor data sets collected in the wild and socio-demographic information about the patients. Our results showed that in the WHODAS 2.0 mobility impairment prediction task, the proposed pipeline outperformed a prior baseline while additionally providing interpretability with attention heatmaps. Moreover, using a much smaller cohort via task transfer learning, the same model could learn to predict generalised anxiety severity accurately based on GAD-7 scores. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - Ubiquitous computing has been a green research area that has managed to attract and sustain the attention of researchers for some time now. As ubiquitous computing applications, human activity recognition and localization have also been popularly worked on. These applications are used in healthcare monitoring, behavior analysis, personal safety, and entertainment. A robust model has been proposed in this article that works over IoT data extracted from smartphone and smartwatch sensors to recognize the activities performed by the user and, in the meantime, classify the location at which the human performed that particular activity. The system starts by denoising the input signal using a second-order Butterworth filter and then uses a hamming window to divide the signal into small data chunks. Multiple stacked windows are generated using three windows per stack, which, in turn, prove helpful in producing more reliable features. The stacked data are then transferred to two parallel feature extraction blocks, i.e., human activity recognition and human localization. The respective features are extracted for both modules that reinforce the system’s accuracy. A recursive feature elimination is applied to the features of both categories independently to select the most informative ones among them. After the feature selection, a genetic algorithm is used to generate ten different generations of each feature vector for data augmentation purposes, which directly impacts the system’s performance. Finally, a deep neural decision forest is trained for classifying the activity and the subject’s location while working on both of these attributes in parallel. For the evaluation and testing of the proposed system, two openly accessible benchmark datasets, the ExtraSensory dataset and the Sussex-Huawei Locomotion dataset, were used. The system outperformed the available state-of-the-art systems by recognizing human activities with an accuracy of 88.25% and classifying the location with an accuracy of 90.63% over the ExtraSensory dataset, while, for the Sussex-Huawei Locomotion dataset, the respective results were 96.00% and 90.50% accurate. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - This article reviews the recent advances in the field of batteryless near-field communication (NFC) sensors for chemical sensing and biosensing. The commercial availability of low-cost commercial NFC integrated circuits (ICs) and their massive integration in smartphones, used as readers and cloud interfaces, have aroused great interest in new batteryless NFC sensors. The fact that coil antennas are not importantly affected by the body compared with other wireless sensors based on far-field communications makes this technology suitable for future wearable point-of-care testing (PoCT) devices. This review first compares energy harvesting based on NFC to other energy-harvesting technologies. Next, some practical recommendations for designing and tuning NFC-based tags are described. Power transfer is key because in most cases, the energy harvested has to be stable for several seconds and not contaminated by undesired signals. For this reason, the effect of the dimensions of the coils and the conductivity on the wireless power transfer is thoroughly discussed. In the last part of the review, the state of the art in NFC-based chemical and biosensors is presented. NFC-based tags (or sensor tags) are mainly based on commercial or custom NFC ICs, which are used to harvest the energy from the RF field generated by the smartphone to power the electronics. Low-consumption colorimeters and potentiostats can be integrated into these NFC tags, opening the door to the integration of chemical sensors and biosensors, which can be harvested and read from a smartphone. The smartphone is also used to upload the acquired information to the cloud to facilitate the internet of medical things (IoMT) paradigm. Finally, several chipless sensors recently proposed in the literature as a low-cost alternative for chemical applications are discussed. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Continuous remote monitoring of key health parameters can be facilitated by noninvasive cardiovascular signals such as the seismocardiogram (SCG) and electrocardiogram (ECG). However, the accuracy of health parameter estimation is dependent on the quality of the signals collected and the algorithms used, which can be particularly challenging in the presence of environmental noise and motion artifacts. In this work, SeismoNet, a highly-sensitive, low-power, multi-node wireless wearable platform is introduced that enables recording of small amplitude acceleration signals (especially SCG signals) and ECG from multiple points on the human body. Using the SeismoNet, we performed a study involving 20 human participants with five nodes placed around the trunk, and showed that combining multiple nodes can improve the estimation performance of heart rate (HR) and respiration rate (RR) by approximately 30% and 23%, respectively. This suggests that combining acceleration data from multiple points on the body can enhance the cardiac and respiratory content of the acquired data, resulting in more accurate predictions. Furthermore, the SeismoNet platform and the dataset collected can be utilized to explore research questions related to multi-point physiological sensing. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - IoMT sensors are used for continuous real-time remote monitoring of patients’ health indicators. IoMT integrate several devices to capture sensitive medical data from devices such as implants and wearables that results in cost-effective and improved health. In IoT settings, the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol is frequently used for machine-to-machine data transfer. However, secure transmission of sensitive health data is critical because these devices are resource constrained and are more vulnerable to MQTT based threats including brute force attack. This warrants a robust, effective, and reliable threat mitigation mechanism, while maintaining a fine balance between accuracy and interpretability. Based on a comprehensive overview of previous work and available datasets, we propose an explainable intrusion detection mechanism to detect MQTT-based attacks. The MQTT-IOT-IDS2020 dataset is used as a benchmark. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used for the selection of optimal features from the dataset. The performance of ten machine learning (ML) methods is evaluated and compared. The results demonstrate excellent classification accuracies between 97% and 99%. We applied LIME explanations to increase human interpretability for the best performing model. Copyright © 2023 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

AB  - The adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare is growing rapidly. Remote patient monitoring (RPM) is one of the common healthcare applications that assist doctors to monitor patients with chronic or acute illness at remote locations, elderly people in-home care, and even hospitalized patients. The reliability of manual patient monitoring systems depends on staff time management which is dependent on their workload. Conventional patient monitoring involves invasive approaches which require skin contact to monitor health status. This study aims to do a comprehensive review of RPM systems including adopted advanced technologies, AI impact on RPM, challenges and trends in AI-enabled RPM. This review explores the benefits and challenges of patient-centric RPM architectures enabled with Internet of Things wearable devices and sensors using the cloud, fog, edge, and blockchain technologies. The role of AI in RPM ranges from physical activity classification to chronic disease monitoring and vital signs monitoring in emergency settings. This review results show that AI-enabled RPM architectures have transformed healthcare monitoring applications because of their ability to detect early deterioration in patients' health, personalize individual patient health parameter monitoring using federated learning, and learn human behavior patterns using techniques such as reinforcement learning. This review discusses the challenges and trends to adopt AI to RPM systems and implementation issues. The future directions of AI in RPM applications are analyzed based on the challenges and trends.

AB  - Smart healthcare monitoring systems are proliferating due to the Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled portable medical devices. The IoT and deep learning in the healthcare sector prevent diseases by evolving healthcare from face-to-face consultation to telemedicine. To protect athletes’ life from life-threatening severe conditions and injuries in training and competitions, real-time monitoring of physiological indicators is critical. In this research work, we present a deep learning-based IoT-enabled real-time health monitoring system. The proposed system uses wearable medical devices to measure vital signs and apply various deep learning algorithms to extract valuable information. For this purpose, we have taken Sanda athletes as our case study. The deep learning algorithms help physicians properly analyze these athletes’ conditions and offer the proper medications to them, even if the doctors are away. The performance of the proposed system is extensively evaluated using a cross-validation test by considering various statistical-based performance measurement metrics. The proposed system is considered an effective tool that diagnoses dreadful diseases among the athletes, such as brain tumors, heart disease, cancer, etc. The performance results of the proposed system are evaluated in terms of precision, recall, AUC, and F1, respectively. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Heart disease is a leading cause of death in India. Many times, heart diseases do not show symptoms until they become a matter of concern. This silent nature calls for real time monitoring of vitals. In this paper, we propose a healthcare monitoring system which makes use of existing wearable devices to measure vitals of the user’s body. The data gathered is used to perform real time analysis to detect any irregularities and simultaneously to predict if there are any underlying problems that might be of future concern. © 2023, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

AB  - Falling is one of the primary causes of firefighter casualties. Therefore, early fall detection, followed by reliable and timely notification, is vital to ensure the survival of firefighters. However, due to complex and diverse firefighting scenarios, current fall detection systems (FDSs) are inadequate, especially in terms of accuracy and real-time applications. Hence, in this study, a wearable pre-impact FDS (PIFDS) for firefighters is proposed. We also evaluated the feasibility of using machine learning (ML) and ensemble learning (EL) methods deployed on the edge node to simultaneously improve the real-time performance and accuracy. Moving thresholding method is introduced to overcome the class-imbalanced issue due to fewer samples acquired during the pre-impact (PI) phase. Based on 14 firefighters' data collection, the experimental results revealed that a Decision Tree classifier with optimized parameters (DT-ED4) outperformed other ML and EL methods in a tradeoff between processing time and accuracy. The results also showed that our system can detect falls before the impact with an average lead time of 447.9 ms, sensitivity of 95.10%, and specificity of 97.99%. The system's heterogeneous IoT network architecture facilitated remote monitoring and alerts that enabled the incident commander (IC) to execute the rescue mission immediately upon notification. This study enhances the practicability of PIFDS and extends the application range of PIFDS from healthcare to firefighting.  © 2001-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Wearable sensor (WS) technology and social media platforms (SMPs) are increasingly being used to monitor healthcare, and this has opened up new possibilities as chronic illnesses become more common. The development of a novel technique for gathering patient data for effective healthcare monitoring relies heavily on WS and SMP. But WS-based continuous patient monitoring produces a great deal of healthcare data. Furthermore, the user-generated health information on social networking sites is unstructured and produced in massive amounts. The current healthcare monitoring systems struggle to adequately analyze the useful information that may be gleaned from social networking and sensor data. Additionally, processing healthcare big data for anomaly prediction does not work well with conventional machine learning methods. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to propose an automated healthcare monitoring system for better categorization accuracy via accurate data storage and analysis. A novel fuzzy binary temporal long short-term memory (FBTLSTM) approach is used to appropriately categorize healthcare data and forecast drug side effects and abnormal conditions in patients. Patients' healthcare data, including diabetes, blood pressure, mental health, and drug evaluations, is used to categorize their health status in the proposed system. The findings demonstrate that the suggested model accurately manages heterogeneous data, enhances the categorization of medical conditions, and improves the predictability of drug side effects. © 2023, Ismail Saritas.

AB  - The real-time revolutions per minute (RPM) data, ECG signal, pulse rate, and oxygen saturation levels were collected during 16-minute cycling exercises. In parallel, ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) were collected each minute from the study participants. A 2-minute moving window, with one minute shift, was applied to each 16-minute exercise session to divide it into a total of fifteen 2-minute windows. Based on the self-reported RPE, each exercise window was labeled as 'high exertion' or 'low exertion' classes. The heart rate variability (HRV) characteristics in time and frequency domains were extracted from the collected ECG signals for each window. In addition, collected oxygen saturation levels, pulse rate, and RPMs were averaged for each window. The best predictive features were then selected using the minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) algorithm. Top selected features were then used to assess the accuracy of five ML classifiers to predict the level of exertion. The Naïve Bayes model demonstrated the best performance with an accuracy of 80% and an F1 score of 79%. © 2023 The authors and IOS Press.

AB  - Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) focuses on the improvement of health or the prevention of further disease progression after an event. Despite the documented benefits of CR programs, the participation remains suboptimal. Home-based CR programs have been proposed to improve uptake and adherence. The goal of this study was to apply an end-to-end methodology including machine learning techniques to predict the 6-month adherence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) patients to a home-based telemonitoring CR program, combining patients’ clinical information with their actual program participation during a short familiarization phase. Fifty CVD patients participated in such a program for 6 months, enabling personalized guidance during a phase III CR study. Clinical, fitness, and psychological data were measured at baseline, whereas actual adherence, in terms of weekly exercise session duration and patient heart rate, was measured using wearables. Hierarchical clustering was used to identify different groups based on (1) patients’ clinical baseline characteristics, (2) exercise adherence during the familiarization phase, and (3) the whole program adherence, whereas the output of the clustering was determined using repetitive decision trees (DTs) and random forest (RF) techniques to predict long-term adherence. Finally, for each cluster of patients, network analysis was applied to discover correlations of their characteristics that link to adherence. Based on baseline characteristics, patients were clustered into three groups, with differences in behavior and risk factors, whereas adherent, non-adherent, and transient adherent patients were identified during the familiarization phase. Regarding the prediction of long-term adherence, the most common DT showed higher performance compared with RF (precision: 80.2 ± 19.5% and 71.8 ± 25.8%, recall: 94.5 ± 14.5% and 71.8 ± 25.8% for DT and RF accordingly). The analysis of the DT rules and the analysis of the feature importance of the RF model highlighted the significance of non-adherence during the familiarization phase, as well as that of the baseline characteristics to predict future adherence. Network analysis revealed different relationships in different clusters of patients and the interplay between their behavioral characteristics. In conclusion, the main novelty of this study is the application of machine learning techniques combining patient characteristics before the start of the home-based CR programs with data during a short familiarization phase, which can predict long-term adherence with high accuracy. The data used in this study are available through connected health technologies and standard measurements in CR; thus, the proposed methodology can be generalized to other telerehabilitation programs and help healthcare providers to improve patient-tailored enrolment strategies and resource allocation. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - This pilot study used Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models to predict exercise exertion levels based on physiological data acquired from wearable devices. The data, including revolutions per minute (RPM), level of oxygen saturation, real-time ECG, and pulse rate were collected during a 16-minute cycling exercise across three intensity levels. Ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) from study subjects were recorded at the end of each consecutive minute during every session. The 16-minute sessions were segmented into eight 2-minute windows, and each window was categorized as either "high exertion"or "low exertion"based on self-reported RPEs. Predictive features were calculated by averaging oxygen saturation levels, heart rate, and RPMs for each 2-minute window. Additionally, heart rate variability (HRV) features were extracted from collected ECG data in both temporal and frequency domains. The selection of predictive features was performed using the minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) algorithm. The top features selected were employed to train and test the LSTM and the GRU classifiers for predicting the exertion level of the subsequent window. The resulting classifiers exhibited testing accuracies of 78.6% and F-1 scores of 80%. This pilot study underscores the potential of employing a deep learning model for real-time prediction of perceived exercise exertion.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - The current advancements in technology have paved the way for innovative approaches to improve healthcare services, including the Machine Learning and and the Internet of Things (loT). More precisely, Internet of Medical Things (loMT), have shown their results in providing a rapid medical assistance to the medical staff in order to better serve their patients. The latter refers to the network of interconnected medical devices, wearable gadgets, sensors, and equipment that can collect, transmit, and share medical data and information via the internet. On the other hand, Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a transformative technology in the healthcare sector, revolutionizing how medical data is analyzed and utilized. Multiple applications of ML in healthcare have been deeply analyzed and discussed such as the enhancement of disease diagnosis, treatment optimization, and surgical operations. Nonetheless, the insights gained by these trained ML models remain confined to the data collected within the immediate environment and the distinct characteristics of each patient's context. Furthermore, the reluctance to share these models securely with external systems and entities hinders the progression of such solutions toward a broader, more accurate, and resilient framework. Therefore, in this paper, a special focus is given to specific field of ML which is Federated Learning (FL). The main objective is to discuss the potential of to sharing already trained ML models across multiple entities for a better health issues detection. Such trained models already contains knowledge that can be directly used by other entities to either detect an already known health issues or new ones. Thus, this paper presents a comprehensive study on the synergistic utilization of these technologies to share medical knowledge while addressing privacy concerns and enable personalized healthcare solutions. We explore the theoretical foundations and potential applications of integrating Federated Learning and 10MT in remote monitoring.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Real intervention and treatment standards drew attention to remote health monitoring frameworks. Remote monitoring frameworks for disease detection at an early stage are opposed by most conventional works. Even so, it ran into issues like increased operational complexity, higher resource costs, inaccurate predictions, longer data collection times, and a lower convergence rate. A remote health monitoring framework that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to predict heart disease and diabetes from medical datasets is the goal of this project. Patients' health data is collected via smart devices, and the resulting data is then combined using a variety of nodes, including a detection node, a visualisation node, and a prognostic node. People with long-term illnesses (such as the elderly and disabled) are in such greater demand than ever before that a new approach to healthcare delivery is essential. In the evolved paradigm, conventional physical medical services foundations like clinics, nursing homes, and long haul care offices will be old. Due to recent advancements in modern technology, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), the smart healthcare system has become increasingly necessary (ML). This paper will discuss wearable and smartphone technologies, AI for medical diagnostics, and assistive structures, including social robots, that have been created for the surrounding upheld living climate. The review presents programming reconciliation structures that are urgent for consolidating information examination and other man-made consciousness instruments to develop brilliant medical care frameworks (AI). © The Author(s), 2023.

AB  - Healthcare sensors represent a valid and non-invasive instrument to capture and analyse physiological data. Several vital signals, such as voice signals, can be acquired anytime and anywhere, achieved with the least possible discomfort to the patient thanks to the development of increasingly advanced devices. The integration of sensors with artificial intelligence techniques contributes to the realization of faster and easier solutions aimed at improving early diagnosis, personalized treatment, remote patient monitoring and better decision making, all tasks vital in a critical situation such as that of the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper presents a study about the possibility to support the early and non-invasive detection of COVID-19 through the analysis of voice signals by means of the main machine learning algorithms. If demonstrated, this detection capacity could be embedded in a powerful mobile screening application. To perform this important study, the Coswara dataset is considered. The aim of this investigation is not only to evaluate which machine learning technique best distinguishes a healthy voice from a pathological one, but also to identify which vowel sound is most seriously affected by COVID-19 and is, therefore, most reliable in detecting the pathology. The results show that Random Forest is the technique that classifies most accurately healthy and pathological voices. Moreover, the evaluation of the vowel /e/ allows the detection of the effects of COVID-19 on voice quality with a better accuracy than the other vowels. © 2021, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals.

AB  - In this paper, we analyzed real-time physiological data using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict exercise exertion levels during exercise. The data was collected During a 16-minute cycling exercise for ten participants. Using wearable devices, Real-time ECG, pulse rate, oxygen saturation, pulse amplitude index (PAI), and revolutions per minute (RPM) data were collected at three intensity levels for each individual. Each subject's ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) were gathered once per minute during each exercise session. Each 16-minute cycling window was divided into eight non-overlapping windows. For each 2-minute window, heart rate, RPM, PAI, and oxygen saturation levels were averaged to form the predictive features. In addition, the heart rate variability (HRV) features were extracted by analyzing the ECG data statistically and in both time and frequency domains. The extracted features formed most of the predictive features. We used the minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) algorithm response to the collected RPE to select the best features. The leading features were then used to train and test the LSTM regression to predict the next window's exertion level. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - (Figure presented.) © The Author(s) 2022.; The rapid development of flexible electronic technology has led to the in-depth study of flexible wearable sensors to achieve accurate sensing under different external stimuli. However, it is still a huge challenge to develop hydrogel-based wearable skin-like sensors with super ductility, high sensitivity, and self-healing properties. Herein, the Ti3C2 type of MXene was synthesized, and the Ag/MXene nanocomplexes were incorporated into polyvinyl alcohol-borax matrix to construct a novel composite hydrogel as the multifunctional nanofillers, which could bring both improved properties and novel functionalities. The Ag/MXene-Poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogel displayed integrated merits of highly strain sensitive (GF = 3.26), self-healing (within 10 min, 91% healing efficiency), and excellent antibacterial activity. The hydrogel could be assembled into a wearable skin-like sensor to monitor human movement, including large deformations (finger, elbow, wrist, and knee bending) and tiny deformations (mouth’s movement and throat vocalization) in real time. Therefore, this work shed a new light on the development of flexible wearable skin-like sensors for the personalized healthcare monitoring, human–machine interfaces, and artificial intelligence. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Smart home monitoring systems via internet of things (IoT) are required for taking care of elders at home. They provide the flexibility of monitoring elders remotely for their families and caregivers. Activities of daily living are an efficient way to effectively monitor elderly people at home and patients at caregiving facilities. The monitoring of such actions depends largely on IoT-based devices, either wireless or installed at different places. This paper proposes an effective and robust layered architecture using multisensory devices to recognize the activities of daily living from anywhere. Multimodality refers to the sensory devices of multiple types working together to achieve the objective of remote monitoring. Therefore, the proposed multimodal-based approach includes IoT devices, such as wearable inertial sensors and videos recorded during daily routines, fused together. The data from these multi-sensors have to be processed through a pre-processing layer through different stages, such as data filtration, segmentation, landmark detection, and 2D stick model. In next layer called the features processing, we have extracted, fused, and optimized different features from multimodal sensors. The final layer, called classification, has been utilized to recognize the activities of daily living via a deep learning technique known as convolutional neural network. It is observed from the proposed IoT-based multimodal layered system’s results that an acceptable mean accuracy rate of 84.14% has been achieved. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Wearable sensors are often used to assist with the healthcare of elderly people within their own homes for detecting incidents such as falls. However, wearable sensors cause numerous issues: they are uncomfortable, they are often forgotten, or they simply run out of battery. One alternative to providing accurate fall detection systems is making use of ambient microwave signals to detect movements. WiFi in particular is a technology that is present in many homes and interestingly, the signal transmission is affected when humans move in between the path of transmission. However, the setup needed for using this as an effective identification method is unclear. This paper focuses here on the performance gain in using multiple devices as transmitters and receivers, instead of only one pair in a simple identification task. We report an increased accuracy in identifying a human subject sitting and standing over a pool of machine learning algorithms when the two Raspberry PI pairs of devices were used in comparison to a single pair of devices. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - IoT technology has created tremendous healthcare potential. This research study introduces an IoT-controlled gadget that manages patient electromyography (EMG) readings and provides real-time notifications. EMG signals help diagnose and monitor neuromuscular problems, making proper measurement and analysis essential for optimal healthcare. Wearable EMG sensors, a microprocessor, and cloud infrastructure comprise the IoT-controlled gadget. The microcontroller receives EMG signals from the patient's wearable sensors. The microcontroller uses IoT to securely communicate data to a cloud-based infrastructure for analysis. EMG signals are analyzed using modern algorithms and machine learning on the cloud. These algorithms examine signal patterns, identify abnormalities, and categorize data based on predetermined criteria. The technology also alerts healthcare providers for important deviations or aberrant EMG patterns. IoT-controlled EMG monitoring devices have various benefits. Wireless connection allows patients to roam freely for continuous monitoring. Real-time notifications improve patient safety and reaction time in emergency scenarios. The cloud-based architecture also allows remote consultations and patient monitoring using EMG data. The suggested gadget was extensively tested with a varied population of patients. The findings show the device's accurate EMG signal capture and real-time alarms. This study introduces an IoT-controlled gadget for patient EMG signal management and real-time notifications. IoT technologies, wearable sensors, and cloud-based analytics streamline EMG data monitoring and analysis, improving patient care and healthcare outcomes. This work contributes to IoT-enabled healthcare solution research and advances neuromuscular condition management. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - The proliferation of Internet-connected health devices and the widespread availability of mobile connectivity have resulted in a wealth of reliable digital health data and the potential for delivering just-in-time interventions. However, leveraging these opportunities for health research requires the development and deployment of mobile health (mHealth) applications, which present significant technical challenges for researchers. While existing mHealth solutions have made progress in addressing some of these challenges, they often fall short in terms of time-to-use, affordability, and flexibility for personalization and adaptation. ZotCare aims to address these limitations by offering ready-to-use and flexible services, providing researchers with an accessible, cost-effective, and adaptable solution for their mHealth studies. This article focuses on ZotCare’s service orchestration and highlights its capabilities in creating a programmable environment for mHealth research. Additionally, we showcase several successful research use cases that have utilized ZotCare, both in the past and in ongoing projects. Furthermore, we provide resources and information for researchers who are considering ZotCare as their mHealth research solution. 2023 Labbaf, Abbasian, Azimi, Dutt and Rahmani.

AB  - The use of telemonitoring solutions via wearable sensors is believed to play a major role in the prevention and therapy of physical weakening in older adults. Despite the various studies found in the literature, some elements are still not well addressed, such as the study cohort, the experimental protocol, the type of research design, as well as the relevant features in this context. To this end, the objective of this pilot study was to investigate the efficacy of data-driven systems to characterize older individuals over 80 years of age with impaired physical function, during their daily routine and under unsupervised conditions. We propose a fully automated process which extracts a set of heterogeneous time-domain features from 24-hour files of acceleration and barometric data. After being statistically tested, the most discriminant features fed a group of machine learning classifiers to distinguish frail from non-frail subjects, achieving an accuracy up to 93.51%. Our analysis, conducted over 570 days of recordings, shows that a longitudinal study is important while using the proposed features, in order to ensure a highly specific diagnosis. This work may serve as a basis for the paradigm of future monitoring systems. © 2023 Abbas et al.

AB  - Stroke is one the most dangerous disease all across the world which would lead to serious disability or death among all aged people due to changes in environmental factors. Recent reports indicate that a mere 75 million people will suffer from stroke-related disabilities by the year 2030. It was also identified that a stroke occurs every 40 seconds on average across the globe. One out of every five stroke-related patients would die in a year. A Recent health survey indicates that most developed countries face a high number of stroke patients in very recent years. There is also a rapid growth in the number of stroke cases in developing countries. To prevent the high-risk factors related to stroke diseases, there is much need for continuous observation of physiological signals in real-time and to analyze the data. One of the main strategies is wearable technology that employs wireless sensor networks to link numerous medical devices and associated systems. They have to ability to function independently across several platforms. Wearable devices are used in most medical applications because of their noteworthy qualities, including adaptability, versatility, inexpensiveness, and efficiency in various platforms. Integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) with wearable devices and Fog Computing provides a more flexible mechanism to deploy a continuous healthcare monitoring system to monitor vital symptoms and to detect the early phase of stroke factors instantly. To predict stroke-related disorders, this research proposes a Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN)-centric healthcare system for continuous monitoring and examination of physiological signals. Initially, the proposed model predicts the nature of the symptoms based on the parameters collected by the IoT sensors. Deep learning techniques are then applied to predict the risk factors that are critical to the stroke patient during the emergency condition. The key contribution of this research work is to provide an emergency alert to a stroke patient and medical professionals for timely treatment to avoid critical conditions. Empirical analyses show that the proposed model delivers a good result with efficient bandwidth and less response time when compared to other existing healthcare models. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - As domestic athletes and other sports become more and more popular, the health protection of athletes has gradually attracted people's attention, and the heart rate monitoring of machine learning sensors has gradually been understood by people. In order to in-depth study the current status of the role of machine learning sensors in wearable heart rate monitoring, this article uses the new and old sensor comparison method, the field survey method and the human sample test method, collects samples, analyzes the machine learning sensor, and streamlines the algorithm. And create a sensor for wearable heart rate monitoring. In studying the innovation and improvement of the comparison between the new sensor and the old one, this paper uses the shimmer node on the Tiny-OS platform to collect a total of 36 sets of heart rate data of three men and three women in different exercise states, and uses two types of algorithms to calculate the results. It shows that the calculation time of the algorithm proposed in the paper is 0.21, the traditional electrocardiogram (ECG) algorithm is 0.28, and the new algorithm has lower time complexity. Research on the accuracy of the sensor in practical application shows that the recognition rate of riding a bicycle is almost close to 1.00, which fully meets the 0.96 recognition requirement of this system. Although, the single recognition rate of standing still did not reach 0.95. However, the total average recognition rate of the nine sports is 0.971, which is already above 0.96, which proves that the average recognition rate of the monitoring system is above 96%.

AB  - Healthcare monitoring for humans is important due to several factors including life quality and early detection of health-related problems. Human activity patterns recognition is the most promising ways to monitor human health. Uprisings in the human activity patterns recognition has enabled researchers to recognize multiple health issues through the usage of multiple sensory devices such as motion-based wearable sensors. Irrelevant motion patterns can lead to overlook the important activity recognition in daily living. For this purpose, an early discovery of motion patterns has been proposed for activity recognition in this paper. Main objective is to support the activity detection through motion patterns and deep learning mechanism. The proposed method contains three layered architecture including pre-processing layer, features engineering layer, and classification layer. The anticipated study is investigated over an openly available dataset named Opportunity and results have shown improvement in terms of achieving higher accuracy rate of 88.57%. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Hypertension, or elevated blood pressure (BP), is a marker for many cardiovascular diseases and can lead to life threatening conditions such as heart failure, coronary artery disease and stroke. Several techniques have recently been proposed and investigated for non-invasive BP monitoring. The increasing desire for telemonitoring solutions that allow patients to manage their own conditions from home has accelerated the development of new BP monitoring techniques. In this review, we present the recent progress in non-invasive blood pressure monitoring solutions emphasizing clinical validation and trade-offs between available techniques. We introduce the current BP measurement techniques with their underlying operating principles. New promising proof-of-concept studies are presented and recent modeling and machine learning approaches for improved BP estimation are summarized. This aids discussions on how new BP monitors should evaluated in order to bring forth new home monitoring solutions in wearable form factor. Finally, we discuss on unresolved challenges in making convenient, reliable and validated BP monitoring solutions.  © 2008-2011 IEEE.

AB  - The healthcare sector has been overburdened with the massive outbreak of COVID-19 for almost two years and has created an urgent need for remote patient monitoring and treatment with minimal human involvement. Adopting artificial-intelligence- (AI)-based techniques for patient treatment has brought a dramatic revolution into the modern smart healthcare system (SHS). Modern healthcare is leveraging the internet of medical things (IoMT) network comprised of wireless body sensor devices (WBSDs) and implantable medical devices (IMDs) to reduce treatment latency and cost drastically. However, the open network communication of the less secured IoMT devices and increasing growth of adversarial capability give rise to several vulnerabilities, which need to be taken into consideration while designing SHS. We propose a novel and comprehensive framework with machine learning (ML) and formal analysis capability to build a secure and attack-resilient SHS. Our framework uses a novel ensemble of unsupervised ML-based patient status classification and anomaly detection models with bio-inspired computing (BIC)-based ML models’ hyperparameter optimization techniques. The proposed anomaly detection model (ADM) can detect zero-day attacks and uses a novel fitness function calculation technique for BIC-based SHS ADM’s hyperparameter optimization. Moreover, the framework leverages novel formal attack analytics to assess the robustness of the underlying classification and abnormality detection models. Our framework is evaluated using the University of Queensland Vital Signs dataset and a realistic synthetic dataset. © 2023 selection and editorial matter, Fei Hu and Xiali Hei; individual chapters, the contributors.

AB  - On-skin patches that record biopotential and biomechanical signals are essential for wearable healthcare monitoring, clinical treatment, and human-machine interaction. To acquire wearing comfort and high-quality signals, patches with tissue-like softness, elastic recovery, damage tolerance, and robust bioelectronic interface are highly desired yet challenging to achieve. Here, we report a dry epidermal patch made from a supramolecular polymer (SESA) and an in situ transferred carbon nanotubes' percolation network. The polymer possesses a hybrid structure of copolymerized permanent scaffold permeated by multiple dynamic interactions, which imparts a desired mechanical response transition from elastic recoil to energy dissipation with increased elongation. Such SESA-based patches are soft (Young's modulus ∼0.1 MPa) and elastic within physiologically relevant strain levels (97% elastic recovery at 50% tensile strain), intrinsically mechanical-electrical damage-resilient (∼90% restoration from damage after 5 min), and interference-immune in dynamic signal acquisition (stretch, underwater, sweat). We demonstrate its versatile physiological sensing applications, including electrocardiogram recording under various disturbances, machine-learning-enabled hand-gesture recognition through electromyogram measurement, subtle radial artery pulse, and drastic knee kinematics sensing. This epidermal patch offers a promising noninvasive, long-duration, and ambulant bioelectronic interfacing with anti-interference robustness. © 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - Deep learning's massive powers are transforming healthcare. In recent years, AI and machine learning have grown in popularity and acceptability. The situation became much more convoluted when the COVID-19 outbreak broke out. During the crisis, we witnessed a rapid digital renovation and the adoption of disruptive technology across different industries. Healthcare was one of the potential sectors that gained many benefits from deploying disruptive technologies. Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning have all become the most vital mechanisms of the business. Deep learning had a significant influence in healthcare, allowing the industry to progress patient monitoring and diagnosis. Drug development, medical imaging and diagnostics, personalized treatments, and patient monitoring improved the health record management, health insurance, and fraud detection. These are some of the most ground-breaking solicitations of deep learning in healthcare. Deep learning and machine learning models can process and analyze various medical and healthcare data, both structured and unstructured. Document classification and maintaining up-to-date health records might become manually difficult. As a result, smart health records can be well-maintained using machine learning with its subsection deep learning. With the advent of telemedicine, wearable, and remote patient monitoring, there is now abundant real-time data on health and deep learning which help in perceptively monitoring the patients and predict risks. Deep learning can efficiently detect insurance frauds and predict future risks. Health insurance benefactors are also an advantage if they use deep learning because the models can predict future trends and behavior to recommend smart insurance policies to the clients. Natural language processing (NLP) forces deep learning algorithms for classification and identification. These two technologies can be used in recognizing and categorizing health data and can also be leveraged to develop chatbots and voice bots. In the current scenario of telehealth, chatbots play a crucial role. It makes the interface with patients. This chapter provides a detail summary about the role of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning in extemporizing the technological improvements in healthcare. It also gives a brief introduction about the various deep learning models, spots out some of the important radiological applications of deep learning algorithms, and finally explains the various applications of deep learning in healthcare. © 2022 River Publishers.

AB  - The Covid-19 pandemic disturbed the smooth functioning of healthcare services throughout the world. New practices such as masking, social distancing and so on were followed to prevent the spread. Further, the severity of the problem increases for the elderly people and people having co-morbidities as proper medical care was not possible and as a result many deaths were recorded. Even for those patients who recovered from Covid could not get proper health monitoring in the Post-Covid phase as a result many deaths and severity in health conditions were reported after the Covid recovery i.e., the Post-Covid era. Technical interventions like the Internet of Things (IoT) based remote patient monitoring using Medical Internet of Things (M-IoT) wearables is one of the solutions that could help in the Post-Covid scenarios. The paper discusses a proposed framework where in a variety of IoT sensing devices along with ML algorithms are used for patient monitoring by utilizing aggregated data acquired from the registered Post-Covid patients. Thus, by using M-IoT along with Machine Learning (ML) approaches could help us in monitoring Post-Covid patients with co-morbidities for and immediate medical help. © 2023 SCPE.

AB  - Monitoring the health of humans in everyday life is quite challenging. Smart wearables have been increasingly important in recent technologies for monitoring and indicating our current health status, which is utilised to appropriately diagnose our health. Monitoring animals' health raises several concerns. We must wait for veterinary specialists to assess and diagnose whether the animals are suffering only in known regions. The result is delayed treatment and degradation of animal health. Therefore, primary health diagnosis is needed. However, mounting equipment was required to identify these features. This research leads to the recognition of the behaviour of animals through this technique, which facilitates the assessment of the health of animals. The use of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) and IoT features an Animals Smart Healthcare Monitoring (ASHM) system for this research to track animal behavior with high precision using sensors and to detect animals' health with great precision. We proposed designing a system that would track the movement and health of an animal. This can be achieved by developing a system with animal smart health monitoring system. The sensor can be mounted on the animal body to get the desired physiological parameters like temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, ECG, and Blood pressure. This health surveillance system method has reduced the mean latency by 75% and provides results with an output accuracy of 98%. © 2022 Lavoisier. All rights reserved.

AB  - India as a country of contrast and diversity has witnessed digital evolution in different waves and stages. The technology is already an integral part of lives of millions in India; however, its application in the health management remains limited unlike developed economies. COVID-19 pandemic has plunged the country into universal, regional, or local lockdowns repeatedly since the last year. An unexpected and unforeseen impact of this has been the usage of technology for doctor-patient interactions through telemedicine. Hitherto limited to certain pockets, virtual interactions with doctors, ordering laboratory investigations through an application or procuring medicines through internet, are now part of mainstream patient behavior. This is a crucial change in the mindset but requires a lot more to be done at various levels to tap its full potential with rheumatologists being at the forefront and leading the change in their specialty. The pool of rheumatologists is very small and mostly concentrated in few urban areas, leading to diagnostic delay, suboptimal treatment, and poor outcomes. Technology could, therefore, become a catalyst for change and harbinger for greater clinician access. There are plenty of discussions about the impact and potential of deep learning, artificial intelligence, remote monitoring with wearables, etc., but plenty of them may not be relevant to Indian patients in the current scenario. Hence, the context, relevance, and applicability are the key for rheumatologists when making a judgment. © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications. All rights reserved.

AB  - Substantial milestones have been attained in the field of heart failure (HF) diagnostics and therapeutics in the past several years that have translated into decreased mortality but a paradoxical increase in HF-related hospitalizations. With increasing data digitalization and access, remote monitoring via wearables and implantables have the potential to transform ambulatory care workflow, with a particular focus on reducing HF hospitalizations. Additionally, artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) have been increasingly employed at multiple stages of healthcare due to their power in assimilating and integrating multidimensional multimodal data and the creation of accurate prediction models. With the ever-increasing troves of data, the implementation of AI/ML algorithms could help improve workflow and outcomes of HF patients, especially time series data collected via remote monitoring. In this review, we sought to describe the basics of AI/ML algorithms with a focus on time series forecasting and the current state of AI/ML within the context of wearable technology in HF, followed by a discussion of the present limitations, including data integration, privacy, and challenges specific to AI/ML application within healthcare. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a progressive neuromuscular disease. Its slow and variable progression makes the development of new treatments highly dependent on validated biomarkers that can quantify disease progression and response to drug interventions. Objective: We aimed to build a tool that estimates FSHD clinical severity based on behavioral features captured using smartphone and remote sensor data. The adoption of remote monitoring tools, such as smartphones and wearables, would provide a novel opportunity for continuous, passive, and objective monitoring of FSHD symptom severity outside the clinic. Methods: In total, 38 genetically confirmed patients with FSHD were enrolled. The FSHD Clinical Score and the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test were used to assess FSHD symptom severity at days 0 and 42. Remote sensor data were collected using an Android smartphone, Withings Steel HR+, Body+, and BPM Connect+ for 6 continuous weeks. We created 2 single-task regression models that estimated the FSHD Clinical Score and TUG separately. Further, we built 1 multitask regression model that estimated the 2 clinical assessments simultaneously. Further, we assessed how an increasingly incremental time window affected the model performance. To do so, we trained the models on an incrementally increasing time window (from day 1 until day 14) and evaluated the predictions of the clinical severity on the remaining 4 weeks of data. Results: The single-task regression models achieved an R2 of 0.57 and 0.59 and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 2.09 and 1.66 when estimating FSHD Clinical Score and TUG, respectively. Time spent at a health-related location (such as a gym or hospital) and call duration were features that were predictive of both clinical assessments. The multitask model achieved an R2 of 0.66 and 0.81 and an RMSE of 1.97 and 1.61 for the FSHD Clinical Score and TUG, respectively, and therefore outperformed the single-task models in estimating clinical severity. The 3 most important features selected by the multitask model were light sleep duration, total steps per day, and mean steps per minute. Using an increasing time window (starting from day 1 to day 14) for the FSHD Clinical Score, TUG, and multitask estimation yielded an average R2 of 0.65, 0.79, and 0.76 and an average RMSE of 3.37, 2.05, and 4.37, respectively. Conclusions: We demonstrated that smartphone and remote sensor data could be used to estimate FSHD clinical severity and therefore complement the assessment of FSHD outside the clinic. In addition, our results illustrated that training the models on the first week of data allows for consistent and stable prediction of FSHD symptom severity. Longitudinal follow-up studies should be conducted to further validate the reliability and validity of the multitask model as a tool to monitor disease progression over a longer period. © Ahnjili Zhuparris, Ghobad Maleki, Ingrid Koopmans, Robert J Doll, Nicoline Voet, Wessel Kraaij, Adam Cohen, Emilie van Brummelen, Joris H De Maeyer, Geert Jan Groeneveld.

AB  - In these recent years, the world has witnessed a kind of social exclusion and the inability to communicate directly due to the Corona Virus Covid 19 (COVID-19) pandemic, and the consequent difficulty of communicating with patients with hospitals led to the need to use modern technology to solve and facilitate the problem of people communicating with each other. healthcare has made many remarkable developments through the Internet of things (IoT) and cloud computing to monitor real-time patients’ data, which has enabled many patients’ lives to be saved. This paper presents the design and implementation of a Private Backend Server Software based on an IoT health monitoring system concerned with emergency medical services utilizing biosensors to detect multi-vital signs of an individual with an ESP32 microcontroller board and IoT cloud. The device displays the vital data, which is then uploaded to a cloud server for storage and analysis over an IoT network. Vital data is received from the cloud server and shown on the IoT medical client dashboard for remote monitoring. The proposed system allows users to ameliorate healthcare jeopardy and minify its costs by re-cording, gathering, sharing, and analyzing vast biodata streams such as Intensive Care Units (ICU) (i.e., temperature, heartbeat rate (HR), Oxygen level (SPO2), etc.), efficiently in real-time. In this proposal, the data is sent from sensors fixed in the patient body to the Web and Mobile App continually in real time for collection and analysis. The system showed impressive performance with an average disparity of less than 1%. body temperature, SPO2, and HR readings were remarkably accurate compared to the CE approval patient monitoring system. In Addition, The system was highly dependable with a success rate for IoT data broadcasts. © 2023,International journal of online and biomedical engineering. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - The successful development of a diagnosis system to identify diabetes in the Internet of Things (IoT) e-healthcare scenario has gained considerable attention to implement accurate diabetes diagnosis. IoT is playing an increasingly important role in healthcare environment by providing a structure for evaluating medical information to detect diseases via data mining techniques. The existing diagnostic methods have some challenges, such as lengthy calculation times and inaccurate predictions. To evade the limitations, this article suggested an IOT-based diagnosis system that uses Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Through the dataset from UCI Repository with medical sensors, a novel systematic technique is utilized to treat diabetic disease, and relevant medical data is produced to precisely predict those who would be seriously impacted by the condition. For predicting the illness and its severity, a brand-new classification technique called Tuna Swarm optimization-Aided Neural Classifier (TSO-NN) is suggested (T. The experimentation is conducted in MATLAB and the performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, and F1-score. Besides, the efficiency is tested and confirmed by comparing over SOTA methods.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Background: Depression is a common condition among cancer patients, across several points in the disease trajectory. Although presenting higher prevalence rates than the general population, it is often not reported or remains unnoticed. Moreover, somatic symptoms of depression are common in the oncological context and should not be dismissed as a general symptom of cancer. It becomes even more challenging to track psychological distress in the period after the treatment, where connection with the healthcare system typically becomes sporadic. The main goal of the FAITH project is to remotely identify and predict depressive symptoms in cancer survivors, based on a federated machine learning (ML) approach, towards optimization of privacy. Methods: FAITH will remotely analyse depression markers, predicting their negative trends. These markers will be treated in distinct categories, namely nutrition, sleep, activity and voice, assessed in part through wearable technologies. The study will include 300 patients who have had a previous diagnosis of breast or lung cancer and will be recruited 1 to 5 years after the end of primary cancer. The study will be organized as a 12-month longitudinal prospective observational cohort study, with monthly assessments to evaluate depression symptoms and quality of life among cancer survivors. The primary endpoint is the severity of depressive symptoms as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (Ham-D) at months 3, 6, 9 and 12. Secondary outcomes include self-reported anxiety and depression symptoms (HADS scale), and perceived quality of life (EORTC questionnaires), at baseline and monthly. Based on the predictive models gathered during the study, FAITH will also aim at further developing a conceptual federated learning framework, enabling to build machine learning models for the prediction and monitoring of depression without direct access to user’s personal data. Discussion: Improvements in the objectivity of psychiatric assessment are necessary. Wearable technologies can provide potential indicators of depression and anxiety and be used for biofeedback. If the FAITH application is effective, it will provide healthcare systems with a novel and innovative method to screen depressive symptoms in oncological settings.

AB  - In the latest days, study into the development of intelligent technologies has proven valuable, contributing to attempts to improve the quality of human existence. Smart glass is one of the intelligent wearable devices that can be used for various purposes, including healthcare monitoring, fall detection, sleep tracking, and human activity recognition (HAR). Smart-phones and smartwatches are the primary wearables utilized in sensor-based HAR to collect human motions for training recognition models based on physical movement. These wearable tools, nevertheless, are more intrusive than smart glasses. Using IMU sensor data acquired via smart glasses, we investigate deep learning algorithms for detecting people's activities of daily living (ADL). This work proposes a hybrid deep neural network that automatically extracts spatial-temporal information from raw data to enhance identification p erformance. We performed tests to evaluate deep learning models using a publically available benchmark dataset, UCA-EHAR, which included IMU sensor data from multiple ADL from smart eyewear. The recommended CNN-LSTM model achieved the best effectiveness with the highest F1-score of 93.20%, as determined by experimental findings.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Fragmentation of healthcare systems through limited cross-speciality communication and intermittent, intervention-based care, without insight into follow-up and compliance, results in poor patient experiences and potentially contributes to suboptimal outcomes. Data-driven tools and novel technologies have the capability to address these shortcomings, but insights from all stakeholders in the care continuum remain lacking. A structured online questionnaire was given to respondents (n = 1432) in nine global geographies to investigate attitudes to the use of data and novel technologies in the management of vascular disease. Patients with coronary or peripheral artery disease (n = 961), physicians responsible for their care (n = 345), and administrators/healthcare leaders with responsibility for commissioning/procuring cardiovascular services (n = 126) were included. Narrative themes arising from the survey included patients’ desire for more personalized healthcare, shared decision-making, and improved communication. Patients, administrators, and physicians perceived and experienced deficiencies in continuity of care, and all acknowledged the potential for data-driven techniques and novel technologies to address some of these shortcomings. Further, physicians and administrators saw the ‘upstream’ segment of the care journey—before diagnosis, at point of diagnosis, and when determining treatment—as key to enabling tangible improvements in patient experience and outcomes. Finally, despite acceptance that data sharing is critical to the success of such interventions, there remains persistent issues related to trust and transparency. The current fragmented care continuum could be improved and streamlined through the adoption of advanced data analytics and novel technologies, including diagnostic and monitoring techniques. Such an approach could enable the refocusing of healthcare from intermittent contacts and intervention-only focus to a more holistic patient view. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Breast cancer is a serious health concern that affects millions of women worldwide. Early detection is crucial for effective management and increasing the chances of survival. However, traditional methods of breast cancer detection can be time-consuming, expensive, and inaccessible to many women. In recent years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as a promising solution for healthcare providers to monitor and manage patients remotely. By leveraging IoT devices such as wearables and sensors, healthcare providers can collect data on patients' health and track changes over time. This paper explores the use of IoT in breast cancer detection and management. Breast Cancer Detection System using IoT presented in this work that combines wearable devices and sensors to monitor changes in breast tissue and collect data on a patient's health. The collected data is analysed using machine learning algorithms to identify potential abnormalities and provide early warning signs of breast cancer. The system is designed to be affordable and accessible, making it particularly suitable for use in low-income or rural areas where traditional methods of breast cancer detection may not be available. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Background: Health-monitoring smart homes are becoming popular, with experts arguing that 9-to-5 health care services might soon become a thing of the past. However, no review has explored the landscape of smart home technologies that aim to promote physical activity and independent living among a wide range of age groups. Objective: This review aims to map published studies on smart home technologies aimed at promoting physical activity among the general and aging populations to unveil the state of the art, its potential, and the research gaps and opportunities. Methods: Articles were retrieved from 6 databases (PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, ACM Library, and Web of Science). The criteria for inclusion were that the articles must be user studies that dealt with smart home or Active Assisted Living technologies and physical activity, were written in English, and were published in peer-reviewed journals. In total, 3 researchers independently and collaboratively assessed the eligibility of the retrieved articles and elicited the relevant data and findings using tables and charts. Results: This review synthesized 20 articles that met the inclusion criteria, 70% (14/20) of which were conducted between 2018 and 2020. Three-quarters of the studies (15/20, 75%) were conducted in Western countries, with the United States accounting for 25% (5/20). Activities of daily living were the most studied (9/20, 45%), followed by physical activity (6/20, 30%), therapeutic exercise (4/20, 20%), and bodyweight exercise (1/20, 5%). K-nearest neighbor and naïve Bayes classifier were the most used machine learning algorithms for activity recognition, with at least 10% (2/20) of the studies using either algorithm. Ambient and wearable technologies were equally studied (8/20, 40% each), followed by robots (3/20, 15%). Activity recognition was the most common goal of the evaluated smart home technologies, with 55% (11/20) of the studies reporting it, followed by activity monitoring (7/20, 35%). Most studies (8/20, 40%) were conducted in a laboratory setting. Moreover, 25% (5/20) and 10% (2/20) were conducted in a home and hospital setting, respectively. Finally, 75% (15/20) had a positive outcome, 15% (3/20) had a mixed outcome, and 10% (2/20) had an indeterminate outcome. Conclusions: Our results suggest that smart home technologies, especially digital personal assistants, coaches, and robots, are effective in promoting physical activity among the young population. Although only few studies were identified among the older population, smart home technologies hold bright prospects in assisting and aiding older people to age in place and function independently, especially in Western countries, where there are shortages of long-term care workers. Hence, there is a need to do more work (eg, cross-cultural studies and randomized controlled trials) among the growing aging population on the effectiveness and acceptance of smart home technologies that aim to promote physical activity. © Kiemute Oyibo, Kang Wang, Plinio Pelegrini Morita.

AB  - Cardiovascular physicians today are immersed in a seemingly endless stream of data that require more exquisite interpretation, yet we are expected to perform more efficiently. From whole genome sequencing, to precision medicine, to wearable devices, the answer to incorporating and synthesizing all these data is artificial intelligence (AI). In traditional medicine, information is often reduced to a few easily measurable parameters, and the patient is assigned a diagnosis. However, in AI-assisted medicine, the evaluation can include multimodal input (unstructured clinical data, raw imaging, remote monitoring metrics, wearable devices, clinical signs, and genetic and laboratory data), which can then lead to a new, comprehensive definition of the disease. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - A confluence of advances in biosensor technologies, enhancements in health care delivery mechanisms, and improvements in machine learning, together with an increased awareness of remote patient monitoring, has accelerated the impact of digital health across nearly every medical discipline. Medical grade wearables-noninvasive, on-body sensors operating with clinical accuracy-will play an increasingly central role in medicine by providing continuous, cost-effective measurement and interpretation of physiological data relevant to patient status and disease trajectory, both inside and outside of established health care settings. Here, we review current digital health technologies and highlight critical gaps to clinical translation and adoption. Copyright © 2022 The Authors, some rights reserved.

AB  - The field of wireless sensor networks has grown significantly due to notable research contributions in the domain of wireless networks and semiconductors. It has been noted in the recent past that WBANs significantly support a range of pervasive medical and healthcare applications. A wireless body area network (WBAN) is a task-oriented, self-organising sensor network and is an interconnection of a multitude of biomarker sensors and medical diagnostic gadgets. These backbone nodes may be embedded in the human body or planted on the human body. In this paper, we proposed a secured WBAN-based system for healthcare facilities. This model will help patients and medical professionals monitor the health of patients at any time despite their physical presence. It also discusses the utilisation of a machine learning based cloud system which keeps learning from new data sets and remains updated about new symptoms.

AB  - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is highly prevalent and is associated with a heavy burden on patients and health systems alike. Exacerbations of COPD (ECOPDs) are a leading cause of acute hospitalization among all adult chronic diseases. There is currently a paradigm shift in the way that ECOPDs are conceptualized. For the first time, objective physiological parameters are being used to define/classify what an ECOPD is (including heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation criteria) and therefore a mechanism to monitor and measure their changes, particularly in an outpatient ambulatory setting, are now of great value. In addition to pre-existing challenges on traditional ‘in-person’ health models such as geography and seasonal (ex. winter) impacts on the ability to deliver in-person visit-based care, the COVID-19 pandemic imposed additional stressors including lockdowns, social distancing, and the closure of pulmonary function labs. These health system stressors, combined with the new conceptualization of ECOPDs, rapid advances in sophistication of hardware and software, and a general openness by stakeholders to embrace this technology, have all influenced the propulsion of remote patient monitoring (RPM) and wearable technology in the modern care of COPD. The present article reviews the use of RPM and wearable technology in COPD. Context on the influences, factors and forces which have helped shape this health system innovation is provided. A focused summary of the literature of RPM in COPD is presented. Finally, the practical and ethical principles which must guide the transition of RPM in COPD into real-world clinical use are reviewed. Copyright © 2023 Coutu, Iorio and Ross.

AB  - One of the most important aspects of human life is health. Every civilization is paying more attention to the early detection of a disease with its prevention along with implementing technology in the area of healthcare. The use of technology helps in identifying the most effective treatments for a variety of chronic illnesses. Deep learning (DL) and the Internet of Things (IoT) are rapidly expanding and playing an extremely important role in a wide range of applications such as healthcare and medical systems. Getting knowledge and useful insights from sophisticated, high-dimensional, and diverse biological data remain a major problem in healthcare transformation. The various kinds of data, such as electronic health records (EHRs) or electric medical records (EMRs), sensor data, text, and imaging, are all examples of variable, poorly documented, complex, and unstructured data that have emerged in modern biomedical research. As of now, COVID-19 has been wreaking havoc on the world since December 2019. Fortunately, the IoT is among the most significant paradigms in which artificial intelligence (AI) technology, such as big data analysis and cloud computing are playing a critical role in order to stop the spread of the COVID-19 virus. For instance, in the case of diagnosis and remote screening of COVID-19 patients, AI technology based on machine learning (ML) and DL has redefined the flow of work by having minimum contact with patients, moreover, allowing healthcare professionals to make clinical decisions in a more efficient manner, thus, helping in protecting not only patients but also healthcare professionals. Thus, in healthcare, the IoT plays a critical role in providing patients with better medical facilities as well as supporting hospitals and healthcare professionals. Because of IoT-enabled portable medical equipment, smart healthcare surveillance systems are on the rise. This chapter mainly focuses on the various approaches enabled by AI and DL and their significant applications in the field of medical and healthcare. © 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The rising use of mobile technology and smart gadgets in the field of health has had a significant impact on the global community. Health professionals are increasingly making use of the benefits of these technologies, resulting in a major improvement in health care both in and out of clinical settings. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a new internet revolution that is a rising research area, particularly in health care. Healthcare Monitoring Systems (HMS) have progressed rapidly as the usage of Wearable Sensors (WS) and smartphones have increased. The existing framework of conventional telemedicine's store-and-forward method has some issues, including the need for a nearby health centre with dedicated employees and medical devices to prepare patient reports. Patients' health can be continuously monitored using advanced WS that can be fitted or embedded in their bodies. This research proposes an innovative and smart HMS, which is built using recent technologies such as the IoT and Machine Learning (ML). In this study, we present an innovative and intelligent HMS based on cutting-edge technologies such as the IoT and Deep Learning (DL) + Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). This DL + RBM model is clever enough to detect and process a patient's data using a medical Decision Support System (DSS) to determine whether the patient is suffering from a major health problem and treat it accordingly. The recommended system's behavior is increasingly investigated using a cross-validation test that determines various demographically relevant standard measures. Through a healthcare DSS, this framework is clever enough to detect and analyze a patient's data. Experiment results further reveal that the proposed system is efficient and clever enough to deliver health care. The data reported in this study demonstrate the notion. This device is a low-cost solution for people living in distant places; anyone can use it to determine if they have a major health problem and seek treatment by contacting nearby hospitals. © 2023 CRL Publishing.

AB  - Falls are frequent and associated with morbidity in persons with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). Symptoms of MS fluctuate, and standard biannual clinical visits cannot capture these fluctuations. Remote monitoring techniques that leverage wearable sensors have recently emerged as an approach sensitive to disease variability. Previous research has shown that fall risk can be identified from walking data collected by wearable sensors in controlled laboratory conditions however this data may not be generalizable to variable home environments. To investigate fall risk and daily activity performance from remote data, we introduce a new open-source dataset featuring data collected from 38 PwMS, 21 of whom are identified as fallers and 17 as non-fallers based on their six-month fall history. This dataset contains inertial-measurement-unit data from eleven body locations collected in the laboratory, patient-reported surveys and neurological assessments, and two days of free-living sensor data from the chest and right thigh. Six-month (n = 28) and one-year repeat assessment (n = 15) data are also available for some patients. To demonstrate the utility of these data, we explore the use of free-living walking bouts for characterizing fall risk in PwMS, compare these data to those collected in controlled environments, and examine the impact of bout duration on gait parameters and fall risk estimates. Both gait parameters and fall risk classification performance were found to change with bout duration. Deep learning models outperformed feature-based models using home data; the best performance was observed with all bouts for deep-learning and short bouts for feature-based models when evaluating performance on individual bouts. Overall, short duration free-living walking bouts were found to be the least similar to laboratory walking, longer duration free-living walking bouts provided more significant differences between fallers and non-fallers, and an aggregation of all free-living walking bouts yields the best performance in fall risk classification. © 2022 Meyer et al.

AB  - On the lap of this present-day epoch, Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has been of considerable assistance in case of health monitoring and recovery. The utilization of machine learning approach integration with intelligent agent in the area of health informatics collected via Human Activity Recognition enhances the decision making quality and significance. Its specific homogenization into the Smart Healthcare Monitoring permits gathering, examining and learning from Internet of Things (IoT) wearable devices, undoubtedly achieving knowledge and making analysis on the patient's state. Despite several research works conducted on Smart Healthcare Monitoring, there remains certain amount of pitfalls, like, time, overhead involved in analysis and also the falsification of analysis. To focus on these issues, a Statistical Partial Regression and Support Vector Intelligent Agent Learning (SPR-SVIAL) for Smart Healthcare Monitoring is proposed. The SPR-SVIAL method is split into two stages. First, data pre-processing along with the dimensionality reduced features are extracted by employing Statistical Partial Regression Feature Extraction model. Here, with the ceaseless thump to-pulsate heart information, triaxial accelerometer information, rest quality, actual work and mental attributes obtained from the input dataset acquired from IoT wearable devices, Partial Least Square is applied to extract the dimensionality reduced features, therefore contributing to Smart Healthcare Monitoring time and accuracy. Next, with these resultant features, Support Vector Intelligent Agent Learning is proposed for Smart Healthcare Monitoring that with the aid of Machine Learning and Intelligent Agent not only reduces the falsification of analysis but also reduces the overhead incurred. The SPR-SVIAL method is tested on simulators and the obtained results indicated better performance upon comparison with the other methods. The results show that we can reduce the time, overhead, false positive rate for healthcare monitoring and achieve a high accuracy rate by performing feature extraction for each of the data recording.  © 2023 - IOS Press.

AB  - The healthcare system has moved from post-World War II to revolution. It focuses on infectious diseases and occupational accidents that require temporary interventions. Today’s main goal is to prevent and effectively treat chronic diseases. Healthcare productivity lags behind other service industries as these goals change. The future health ecosystem, like any other ecosystem, will focus on the consumer, which includes effective patient treatment and the healthcare workers. The skills and services that will make up the future health ecosystem include medical imaging modalities integrated with traditional care, home and self-care, patient involvement, self- and virtual care and use of telemedicine (remote monitoring) that can be increasingly provided near or at home. Social care and networks related to the patient’s overall health, with an emphasis on community problems of unmet needs, are taken care too. Patient behaviour and habits that enable well-being and health, including fitness and diet, are also seen as essential elements. The expansion of wearables and the lack of skilled nurses have increased the need for automated, real-time, personalized designs for the medical care of inpatients. Such designs require proficiency in chronic disease management, surgical methods, after care and mental health. Machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI) and data science are everywhere. While data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence are separate tools, when combined together they are powerful, and using them hand in hand is transforming the way we manage the large inflow of medical data and can transform the healthcare into a new medical revolution. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - In recent years, the global Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) industry has evolved at a tremendous speed. Security and privacy are key concerns on the IoMT, owing to the huge scale and deployment of IoMT networks. Machine learning (ML) and blockchain (BC) technologies have significantly enhanced the capabilities and facilities of healthcare 5.0, spawning a new area known as “Smart Healthcare.” By identifying concerns early, a smart healthcare system can help avoid long-term damage. This will enhance the quality of life for patients while reducing their stress and healthcare costs. The IoMT enables a range of functionalities in the field of information technology, one of which is smart and interactive health care. However, combining medical data into a single storage location to train a powerful machine learning model raises concerns about privacy, ownership, and compliance with greater concentration. Federated learning (FL) overcomes the preceding difficulties by utilizing a centralized aggregate server to disseminate a global learning model. Simultaneously, the local participant keeps control of patient information, assuring data confidentiality and security. This article conducts a comprehensive analysis of the findings on blockchain technology entangled with federated learning in healthcare. 5.0. The purpose of this study is to construct a secure health monitoring system in healthcare 5.0 by utilizing a blockchain technology and Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to detect any malicious activity in a healthcare network and enables physicians to monitor patients through medical sensors and take necessary measures periodically by predicting diseases. The proposed system demonstrates that the approach is optimized effectively for healthcare monitoring. In contrast, the proposed healthcare 5.0 system entangled with FL Approach achieves 93.22% accuracy for disease prediction, and the proposed RTS-DELM-based secure healthcare 5.0 system achieves 96.18% accuracy for the estimation of intrusion detection. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - To avoid dire situations, the medical sector must develop various methods for quickly and accurately identifying infections in remote regions. The primary goal of the proposed work is to create a wearable device that uses the Internet of Things (IoT) to carry out several monitoring tasks. To decrease the amount of communication loss as well as the amount of time required to wait before detection and improve detection quality, the designed wearable device is also operated with a multi-objective framework. Additionally, a design method for wearable IoT devices is established, utilizing distinct mathematical approaches to solve these objectives. As a result, the monitored parametric values are saved in a different IoT application platform. Since the proposed study focuses on a multi-objective framework, state design and deep learning (DL) optimization techniques are combined, reducing the complexity of detection in wearable technology. Wearable devices with IoT processes have even been included in current methods. However, a solution cannot be duplicated using mathematical approaches and optimization strategies. Therefore, developed wearable gadgets can be applied to real-time medical applications for fast remote monitoring of an individual. Additionally, the proposed technique is tested in real-time, and an IoT simulation tool is utilized to track the compared experimental results under five different situations. In all of the case studies that were examined, the planned method performs better than the current state-of-the-art methods. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - In recent years, there has been a surge in IoT healthcare applications, ranging from wearable health monitors and remote patient monitoring systems to smart medical devices, telemedicine platforms, and personalized health tracking and management tools. The purpose of these applications is to improve treatment outcomes, streamline healthcare delivery, and enable data-driven decision-making. However, due to the sensitive nature of health data and the critical role that these applications play in people's lives, ensuring their security and privacy has become a paramount concern. To address this issue, we developed an explainable malicious traffic detection and monitoring system based on Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models. The proposed system involves the use of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods such as LIME, SHAP, ELI5, and Integrated Gradients(IG) to ensure the interpretability and explainability of the developed models. Finally, we demonstrate the high accuracy of the developed models in detecting attacks on the intensive care patient dataset. Furthermore, we ensure the transparency and interpretability of the model outcomes by presenting them through the Shapash Monitor interface, which can be easily accessed by both experts and non-experts. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Technological advances have played a critical role in the production of flower crops, enabling farmers to maximize yields and reduce losses while also improving the quality of flowers. These advances have included the development of new breeding techniques, such as molecular marker-assisted breeding, and the use of modern technologies like high-throughput phenotyping to identify and select superior cultivars. In addition, precision farming techniques, such as the use of sensors and remote monitoring systems, have made it possible to closely monitor crop growth and optimize inputs like water and fertilizer, leading to higher yields and improved resource efficiency. Advancements in biotechnology have also resulted in the development of transgenic plants that are resistant to pests and diseases, reducing the need for chemical pesticides and improving plant health. Modern molecular genetic tools, particularly genome editing with CRISPR/Cas9 nucleases, are emerging in addition to conventional approaches of investigating these plants. Furthermore, the use of novel growing systems, such as hydroponics and vertical farming, has allowed for year-round flower production in controlled environments, mitigating the challenges associated with seasonal changes and climate variability. These innovations have also made it possible to produce high-quality flowers in urban areas, bringing fresh blooms closer to consumers. Overall, technological advances in flower crops have revolutionized the floriculture industry, enabling growers to produce high-quality flowers in a more sustainable and efficient manner. These advancements have not only improved the productivity and profitability of flower farming but have also contributed to the conservation of natural resources and the protection of the environment.

AB  - Parkinson’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by several motor symptoms that develop gradually: tremor, bradykinesia, limb rigidity, and gait and balance problems. While there is no cure, levodopa therapy has been shown to mitigate symptoms. A patient on levodopa experiences cycles in the severity of their symptoms, characterized by an ON state—when the drug is active—and an OFF state—when symptoms worsen as the drug wears off. The longitudinal progression of the disease is monitored using episodic assessments performed by trained physicians in the clinic, such as the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Lately, there has been an effort in the field to develop continuous, objective measures of motor symptoms based on wearable sensors and other remote monitoring devices. In this work, we present an effort towards such a solution that uses a single wearable inertial sensor to automatically assess the postural instability and gait disorder (PIGD) of a Parkinson’s disease patient. Sensor data was collected from two independent studies of subjects performing the UPDRS test and then used to train and validate a convolutional neural network model. Given the typical limited size of such studies we also employed the use of generative adversarial networks to improve the performance of deep-learning models that usually require larger amounts of data for training. We show that for a 2-min walk test, our method’s predicted PIGD scores can be used to identify a patient’s ON/OFF states better than a physician evaluated on the same criteria. This result paves the way for more reliable, continuous tracking of Parkinson’s disease symptoms. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - The advancement in automation and medical care technologies in recent decade has changed the traditional medical treatment of patients. Although, these technologies have increased the treatment's precision but the growing number and the complexity of IoT healthcare devices are impacting accuracy along with several other challenges. Moreover, the use of different programming languages, operating platforms and data management methodologies are creating restrictions in safe exchange, integration and reuse of information across different applications. However, with the advent of the semantic web, the semantic technologies are growing in healthcare systems due to the capability of machine interpretation and processing by overcoming the restriction of languages and data heterogeneity. The most common shortcoming in the existing systems are the context-awareness and quality of services and the absence of rich patient ontology; leading towards low accuracy of results. To this aim, this paper provides a smart health framework, consisting on the collection and processing of IoT data (related to patient conditions and context). The framework is supported by the patient ontology along with SWRL rules for better decision making that consider different features (context-awareness and quality of services) differently that results in the improved accuracy. In the evaluation process the proposed work has achieved an accuracy of 89.81%. This work will help the practitioners to treat the patients in a better way.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Background: There is no doubt that the recent surge in artificial intelligence (AI) research will change the trajectory of next-generation health care, making it more approachable and accessible to patients. Therefore, it is critical to research patient perceptions and outcomes because this trend will allow patients to be the primary consumers of health technology and decision makers for their own health. Objective: This study aimed to review and analyze papers on AI-based consumer health informatics (CHI) for successful future patient-centered care. Methods: We searched for all peer-reviewed papers in PubMed published in English before July 2022. Research on an AI-based CHI tool or system that reports patient outcomes or perceptions was identified for the scoping review. Results: We identified 20 papers that met our inclusion criteria. The eligible studies were summarized and discussed with respect to the role of the AI-based CHI system, patient outcomes, and patient perceptions. The AI-based CHI systems identified included systems in mobile health (13/20, 65%), robotics (5/20, 25%), and telemedicine (2/20, 10%). All the systems aimed to provide patients with personalized health care. Patient outcomes and perceptions across various clinical disciplines were discussed, demonstrating the potential of an AI-based CHI system to benefit patients. Conclusions: This scoping review showed the trend in AI-based CHI systems and their impact on patient outcomes as well as patients’ perceptions of these systems. Future studies should also explore how clinicians and health care professionals perceive these consumer-based systems and integrate them into the overall workflow. ©Onur Asan, Euiji Choi,

AB  - Prior to the recent work on a low-cost Ateneo mechanical ventilator machine named A-vent, this study demonstrated a simple Digital Twin approach for a real-time monitoring system that can be useful to any mechanical ventilator unit. Previous research concentrated on A-vent design, Near Cloud data caching, and Machine Learning model development. However, it lacks Internet of Things capabilities for remote monitoring applications. This work incorporates new software components to a Near Cloud server that stores and monitors the ventilator and patient data across the wireless network. Wireless sensor nodes attached to the A-vent and patient interaction model capture the time-series waveform of the ventilator, its predictive analysis, and oximeter values. The data queries command displays the data stored in the Near Cloud databases on the monitoring dashboard. It shows a digital representation of the system, allowing real-time updates to be viewed remotely and easily comprehended. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - The fourth industrial revolution (4IR or Industry 4.0), its communication and information enabling technologies are revolutionizing the production and services applications. In the healthcare domain, electronic health (eHealth) is evolving towards healthcare 4.0 through the Internet of things, big data analytics, Cloud and Fog computing technologies. There is need for early cancer detection, which can be achieved by new imaging technologies for example Terahertz imaging and Infrared thermography. The integration of such new imaging modalities and wearable sensor networks with computer aided diagnosis systems (CAD) and IoT systems with interconnectivity and interoperability could enable continuous, remote observation of cancer diagnosed patients by experts to monitor the success of treatment procedures, side effects of drugs, statistical analysis and making predictions of cancer based on age and demographics etc. for timely intervention and personalized care. In the healthcare 4.0 paradigm, there is need not only for smart diagnosis but also care through remote patient monitoring. The vital signs associated with cancer and clinical information can be integrated to make the system culminate into a smart system with health records. This work proposes an IoT enabled deep learning framework for classification of breast images; we propose the development of both custom CNN model and fine-tuned, pretrained CNN models capable of multimodal image classification. IoT simulation and cloud processing is performed in the ThingSpeak cloud platform with email alert capability. The performance of the CNN models has been evaluated using the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity metrics which achieved 98.44%, 98.44% and 98.45% respectively for the custom CNN model together with the receiver operating characteristics curves and confusion matrices. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Our lives are being drastically changed by artificial intelligence and machine learning, which also transform our lives. Due to advancements in the Internet of things (IoT) paradigm, devices with sensing, processing, and communication abilities may now be built, allowing for the expansion of sensors, embedded devices, and other equipment that can understand the environment. Repetitive medical check-ups and other healthcare services are now being moved from hospitals to patient homes, encouraging healthcare trends. Furthermore, hospitals might relieve some of their workloads by delegating simple chores to the home. As a result, cutting-edge technology must be adopted in the healthcare business to create improved healthcare procedures and technologies and use them for convenient patient monitoring from anywhere on the planet. We created a prototype model for healthcare monitoring systems using the IoT and cloud computing in the suggested system. Various health factors may be monitored and analyzed in real time using these technologies. Various bio-sensors are devoted to the patients in the proposed IoT-enabled system. Sensors collect and store data before sending it to a database or cloud server. The capabilities of a cloud server are to analyze, evaluate, and make decisions about the data that has been stored. © 2023 selection and editorial matter, Durgesh Srivastava, Neha Sharma, Deepak Sinwar, Jabar H.

AB  - One of the most cutting-edge technologies over the years is the Internet of Things (IoT), which is a major force behind the paradigm shift away from conventional medical practises. The goal of IoT-based eHealth is to provide healthcare services that are more effective and individualised through continuous data exchange between linked devices and enhanced data analytics. The IoT and decision-making systems are the main areas of focus of this programme, which seeks to deliver intelligent and proactive healthcare. By considering the huge array of physiological characteristics and applying potent analytical tools like cluster analysis, it is possible to obtain more insight into health-data. In this study, e-health technologies and remote patient monitoring were developed to assist patients in avoiding hospital visits, especially during viral epidemics. This project will use IoT and artificial intelligence (AI) technology to address these problems. The study's objective is to select the most appropriate and effective number of hidden layers and activation function types for the deep net (NN). Describe the patient data sent using IoT protocols next. NN analyses the information from the patient's medical sensors to choose the optimal option. The diagnosis is then communicated to the physician. The proposed technology enables patients to autonomously recognise and forecast the sickness while also supporting clinicians in remote disease discovery and analysis without requiring patients to attend the hospital. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Wearable sensors and social networking sites help gather participant information for healthcare monitoring. Wearable sensors generate a lot of healthcare data for continuous patient monitoring. Social networking sites' user-generated healthcare data is huge and unstructured. Existing healthcare monitoring systems have trouble gathering and evaluating sensor and social network data, and traditional machine learning methods are insufficient to anticipate abnormalities in big healthcare data. A novel cloud-based healthcare monitoring architecture is presented to properly save and evaluate healthcare data and increase classification results. A Wireless Sensor Network and Big Data Analytics based Intelligent Health Monitoring System (IHMS) is suggested in this paper. The suggested large data analytics engine uses data mining, ontologies, and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM). Data processing approaches preprocess information and minimize dimensionality. Proposed ontologies give semantic information about diabetes and blood pressure entities, aspects, and relationships (BP). Bi-LSTM categorizes information properly to forecast medication side effects and patient abnormalities. The suggested approach defines patients' health using diabetes, BP, mental health, and medicine reviews, and this model uses Java and Protégé Web Ontology Language. The findings demonstrate that the suggested system accurately manages healthcare information and predicts pharmacological side effects.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - The past decade has seen substantial growth in the prevalence and capabilities of wearable devices. For instance, recent human activity recognition (HAR) research has explored using wearable devices in applications such as remote monitoring of patients, detection of gait abnormalities, and cognitive disease identification. However, data collection poses a major challenge in developing HAR systems, especially because of the need to store data at a central location. This raises privacy concerns and makes continuous data collection difficult and expensive due to the high cost of transferring data from a user's wearable device to a central repository. Considering this, we explore the adoption of federated learning (FL) as a potential solution to address the privacy and cost issues associated with data collection in HAR. More specifically, we investigate the performance and behavioral differences between FL and deep learning (DL) HAR models, under various conditions relevant to real-world deployments. Namely, we explore the differences between the two types of models when (i) using data from different sensor placements, (ii) having access to users with data from heterogeneous sensor placements, (iii) considering bandwidth efficiency, and (iv) dealing with data with incorrect labels. Our results show that FL models suffer from a consistent performance deficit in comparison to their DL counterparts, but achieve these results with much better bandwidth efficiency. Furthermore, we observe that FL models exhibit very similar responses to those of DL models when exposed to data from heterogeneous sensor placements. Finally, we show that the FL models are more robust to data with incorrect labels than their centralized DL counterparts.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Global health is under various challenges due to demographic shifts and variations in healthcare equity that have become exacerbated during the recent pandemic. The use of healthcare technology, particularly digital health, reflects increased promise for such devices and services at a time when computing power and mobile device use have grown and internet connectivity and access have become ubiquitous. However, thoughtful strategies are needed to design, implement, evaluate, maintain, and scale such solutions to maximize efficacy. First, the healthcare ecosystem, including stakeholders and role of public and private sector actors, must be understood, while considering political and geopolitical context. Second, specific digital health solutions must be chosen after needs assessment, appropriate balance between technology and human capital and larger tech trends toward personalized health goals. Third, implementation of digital health programs should include monitoring and evaluation methods to build and sustain return on investment. Finally, program leaders should consider longer-term strategies to scale solutions and develop financial sustainability. © 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - A methodology for daily physical activity tracking, detection, and classification is proposed using wearable ultrawideband (UWB) technology. The compact UWB antennas act as sensors to provide useful information and metrics regarding the activity, derived from channel information (path loss and rms delay spread) and received signal features. The activities consist of daily activities, such as walking, sitting, running, opening/closing door, and ascending/descending stairs, which are considered as main activities in everyday life. Experimental validation is carried out showing effective tracking capabilities based on the interdistance variation, giving an estimate of the range of movement during various phases of the activity cycle. The computation of patterns of different daily activities cycle provides unique recognition/classification characteristics, which have been validated through template-based and machine learning techniques. The proposed method provides high accuracy, is cost-effective, and has low computation complexity, making it suitable for various healthcare applications, such as elderly/remote monitoring, rehabilitation, patient activity tracking, and general fitness.  © 2001-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Healthcare ICT includes a range of interventions including telemedicine, electronic health records (EHR), data analytics, artificial intelligence, sensor technology, and wearables devices. In achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the time has come to accelerate the development of affordable and sustainable health systems that respect people's needs and values. Because, as a component of a health program, it can augment capacity and improve the overall effectiveness of a health development program. Digitalization and technological advances, including sensors, are transforming connected healthcare into inclusive healthcare, enabling remote monitoring and support for chronically ill patients both inside and outside healthcare facilities. Therefore, wearable biosensors are becoming increasingly effective in the prevention, early diagnosis, control, and treatment of diseases. It has also been observed that due to the COVID-19 epidemic, the world has undergone a radical shift in healthcare with a new shift towards Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM). Assistive ICT also ensures safety, social communication, and greater independence for elderly and vulnerable people with chronic diseases. Bearing in this mind, ICT-assisted healthcare paradigm has been proposed that emphasizes on socio-economic and technoethical dimensions of healthcare services for health and wellbeing. © 2023 School of Science, IHU.

AB  - Nowadays the prevention of dementia is a challenge for humanity. There are some preventive intervention programs for dementia, which are mainly based in the modification of multicomponent lifestyles such as: physical and cognitive activity, weight control, metabolic-comorbidity control and social support. Recently, Mind and Movement Program to have Cognitive Health is a collaborative methodological proposal between the countries Mexico, Japan and Canada, which consists of three components: aerobic exercise; aerobic and cognitive exercises, as well as a motivation program. For performing aerobic and cognitive exercises, the monitoring of vital signs in real time is necessary through a statistical analysis of the data of each patient, in such a way that the doctor knows the state of health of the patient. As a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the original program to acquire experimental data underwent modifications. Since the older adults were isolated, they were required to do their physical exercises at home, implementing a remote monitoring system based on a wearable smart band, which was properly developed to monitor the vital signs for each patient. Hence, a personalized quantification of the oxygen saturation and cardiac pressure based on light sensors and pressure sensors, respectively, was measured and monitored in real time. On the other hand, predefined programming based on Artificial intelligence, provides certain advantages for easy handling by the older adults. Currently, we are working along with a hospital, where doctors involved in the program are testing the prototype for the validation of the wearable smart bands. © 2023 SPIE. All rights reserved.

AB  - Recently, a wide variety of real-world problems are solved via cloud computing, deep learning, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things (IoT). These methodologies are concerned with different areas like smart cities, agriculture, transportation systems, and healthcare systems. The existing researchers focused on the health care monitoring application along with IoT and cloud computing. It met several shortcomings in case of computational complexity, cost, time, and improper health care data storage and so forth. To overcome these challenges, the novel IoT-enabled secure healthcare monitoring model is proposed in this study. At first, several sensors are deployed in the human body thereby collecting patients' data with respect to vital parameters like body temperature deviation. The patient's health record dataset consists of 10 attributes namely phone numbers, marital status, address, age, name, heartbeat rate, oxygen level, smoking, temperature, and blood pressure. The data size reduction and normalization are performed in the IoT medical sensor dataset which contains the redundant or irrelevant attributes that are eliminated during pre-processing. The artificial hummingbird (AHB) algorithm-based convolutional neural network (AHB-CNN) model performs both feature extraction and classification of cancer disease. The AHB-CNN model classifies whether the patient is prone to cancer or not based on the sensor input collected. The received results are then sent to the hospital management for analysis. The Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) encryption method is mostly used in this study due to the major benefits it gives in terms of asymmetric encryption, ease of use, simpler deployment, and high security associated with factoring large prime numbers. A modified RSA algorithm is used in this article which uses the double encryption-decryption process and “n” prime numbers to enhance the security of the conventional RSA algorithm. The data is always encrypted during transit before being stored in the cloud or for further processing. Depending upon the experimental consequences, the proposed method established superior performances compared to other state-of-art techniques. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Continuous healthcare monitoring is a prevalent need for the spinal cord injured (SCI) population to mitigate the risk of secondary health conditions and develop preventive methods. In this paper, we developed an embodied system for remote monitoring and classification of activities of daily living (ADL). We propose a framework for sensor transfer learning to recognize these activities from simple and short samples through label transferring from a deep SlowFast network on video data. Multiple wearable devices were included and synchronized in this study to capture physiological data as well as posture and movement from acceleration and pressure distribution. Furthermore, we propose a pipeline of data capturing for automatically creating a ground truth dataset of different ADLs. Results from a pilot training with eight users in 15 minutes task recordings over eight different tasks produced a weighted accuracy on F1-score of 77% in correctly classifying ADLs. Although extending the data is required to increase precision, we showed a successful method for monitoring and classification of specific activities in SCI with up to 91% in accuracy. Further work will focus on extending to multi-class soft labelling for achieving usability in complex situations. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - An innovative approach for continuous health monitoring in medical applications is presented in this research. The proposed system is composed of Raspberry Pi, cloud storage, machine learning, and IoT sensor. The IoT sensor monitors patients' vitals in real time and quickly identifies any anomalies. The patient wearing the sensors transmit the real-time data with Raspberry Pi processors. The Raspberry Pi collects the real time data from sensors such temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and pulse oximeter. Then the IoT transmits the data collected to a cloud server. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a data processing and analysis method used in the cloud server. The KNN algorithm categorizes and analyzes the data collected, discovers the trend and anomalies present in the patient's vital signs. The proposed system has a simple user interface that can be accessed via a web or mobile application, allowing doctors and nurses to remotely look at the patient's data and generate real-time alerts in case of severe health situations. While cloud technology ensures scalability, data storage, and advanced analytics, the integration of Raspberry Pi devices makes it possible to process data locally and reduce latency. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - With the emergence of latest technology in Internet of Things (IoT), the healthcare sector, the largest in global industry, is undergoing enormous transformations to accommodate recent IoT. Many healthcare leaders are increasing their investments in converting their existing services to take advantage and benefits of IoT, tiling the path for Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), a vast network of medical-related equipment and medical sensors. IoMT has numerous advantages, including providing inaccessible healthcare through remotely observing patients’ vital signs, contributing healthcare medical services to the aging, and nursing a huge number of individuals in a region or country for epidemic identification and prevention. From remote monitoring to smart sensors to medical device integration, IoT technology has a wide range of applications in healthcare. It keeps patients safe and healthy while also improving the physician’s ability to provide treatment to them. Healthcare devices capture a wide range of data from a huge number of real-world scenarios, which improves the accuracy and volume of medical data. This chapter presents an overview of IoT in the healthcare domain, beginning with a description of the supporting technologies for distributing smart healthcare and then moving on to some of the most important IoT applications in healthcare. In this chapter, a study in mental healthcare with IoT and artificial intelligence (AI) and the impact of IoT after Covid-19 in various countries and the future of mental health are discussed. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, S.

AB  - The emergence of low-cost individual sensing devices has facilitated the application of data fusion methods to yield insights useful for score-level, rank-level, or hybrid-level fusion. Intelligent tools for fusion processing, such as fuzzy methods and optimization algorithms, may be used to the deluge of raw data generated by these devices. The use of numerous sensors allows for multi-level/hybrid-level fusion, and the combination of several models for intelligent systems allows for fusion system design optimized for score improvement. Multimedia data fusion applications and machine learning methods can be used to accomplish data fusion in cloud settings. For older people in independent living conditions, a physical activity assessment framework (PAAF) that uses deep learning models for fusion to identify activity and evaluate progress based on the spectral domain of each window is needed. This study highlights the significance of data fusion in outlining the needs for IoT devices in networked computers for distant patient monitoring. In order to provide for the health of the elderly without compromising their comfort or freedom of choice, we need a seniors network based on the Internet of Things and wearable health technology. The sensors’ functionality was investigated by analyzing data gathered from the environment and the organisms within it. The proposed PAAF-IoT architecture has many layers, each one connected to a different device, with the most important part being the integration of data from all of them to classify types of physical activity. Cloud services geographically close to the customer are used to process the resulting mountain of data, reducing end-to-end delay and facilitating prompt responses from healthcare professionals. Data fusion in healthcare and remote patient monitoring are demonstrated through the deployment of an app that allows doctors to remotely administer prescriptions and maintain track of patients’ medical histories. © 2023, American Scientific Publishing Group (ASPG).

AB  - In the past decade, the global industry and research attentions on intelligent skin-like electronics have boosted their applications in diverse fields including human healthcare, Internet of Things, human–machine interfaces, artificial intelligence and soft robotics. Among them, flexible humidity sensors play a vital role in noncontact measurements relying on the unique property of rapid response to humidity change. This work presents an overview of recent advances in flexible humidity sensors using various active functional materials for contactless monitoring. Four categories of humidity sensors are highlighted based on resistive, capacitive, impedance-type and voltage-type working mechanisms. Furthermore, typical strategies including chemical doping, structural design and Joule heating are introduced to enhance the performance of humidity sensors. Drawing on the noncontact perception capability, human/plant healthcare management, human–machine interactions as well as integrated humidity sensor-based feedback systems are presented. The burgeoning innovations in this research field will benefit human society, especially during the COVID-19 epidemic, where cross-infection should be averted and contactless sensation is highly desired.[Figure not available: see fulltext.] © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - According to World Health Organization statistics, falls are the second leading cause of unintentional injury deaths worldwide. With older people being particularly vulnerable, detecting, and reporting falls have been the focus of numerous health technology studies. We screened 267 studies and selected 15 that detailed pervasive fall detection and alerting apps that used smartphone accelerometers. The fall datasets used for the analyses included between 4 and 38 participants and contained data from young and old subjects, with the recorded falls performed exclusively by young subjects. Threshold-based detection was implemented in six cases, while machine learning approaches were implemented in the other nine, including decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, boosting, and neural networks. All methods could ultimately achieve real-time detection, with reported sensitivities ranging from 60.4 to 99.3% and specificities from 74.6 to 100.0%. However, the studies had limitations in their experimental set-ups or considered a restricted scope of daily activities—not always representative of daily life—with which to define falls during the development of their algorithms. Finally, the studies omitted some aspects of data science methodology, such as proper test sets for results evaluation, putting into question whether reported results would correspond to real-world performance. The two primary outcomes of our review are: a ranking of selected articles based on bias risk and a set of 12 impactful and actionable recommendations for future work in fall detection.

AB  - In an era in which aging people have to avoid unnecessary travel to the hospital and risky situations, the medical and healthcare sector are facing more and more of the challenges brought by the digital transformation. A considerable change is taking place in the m-Health sector, since mobile devices, e.g., tablets and smartphones, are increasingly used by citizens. Starting from the need for social contact, through remote monitoring, up to homecare assistance, this chapter will focus on the design and development of m-Health applications that provide coaching services related to physical and cognitive exercise, social relationships and nutrition, to aging people and their formal and informal caregivers. When sensors and medical devices are integrated with m-Health technologies, the services’ development grows exponentially, including early detection and prevention, behavioral monitoring, coaching, etc. In this context, the eco-system becomes more complex since the sensors’ integration generates the acquisition of a large amount of data that requires the application of complex data analysis strategies, e.g., Artificial Intelligence (AI). At this point, the m-Health services to be provided to the final users, i.e., aging people and their caregivers, are based on a measurement process characterized by data acquisition, data analysis, and final service with increasing levels of uncertainty in all the steps of the measurement process. Human-centered design is here proposed as a methodological approach to provide the developers with an interpretation reference defined by the users’ needs, limitations and capabilities and a mean to challenge uncertainty based on user requirements and information needs. Coaching scenarios are data-driven flexible descriptions that require a representation of actions, events, or situations able to explain evidence-based user journeys and to trigger future behaviors, investigating its possible performance, the usage opportunities, the technical weaknesses and validating the design and development hypothesis before actual fulfillment. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - In many sectors, including healthcare services, Internet of Things (IoT) systems are growing rapidly, providing promising technological, economical, and social potential. Healthcare services can be improved with IoT capabilities, including remote patient monitoring, diagnosis of medical issues in real-time, and more, all of which improves both the quality and the satisfaction of human users. The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is gaining momentum as wearable devices, and their numerous health monitoring applications increase popularity. The IoMT plays a significant role in reducing death rates by detecting diseases early. Prediction of heart disease is an essential challenge in clinical dataset analysis. The proposed research aim is to employ machine learning (ML) classification algorithms to predict heart disease. The IoMT-based cloud-fog diagnostics for heart disease have been proposed. Fog layer is used to quickly analyze patient data using ML classification techniques. The performance of the healthcare model is evaluated with different simulations and achieves 97.32% accuracy, 97.58% recall, 97.16% precision, 97.37% F1 -measure, 96.87% specificity, and 97.22% G -mean, which has significant improvement as compared with previous models.  © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Patient sensing and data analytics provide information that plays an important role in the patient care process. Patterns identified from data and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can identify risk/abnormal patients’ data. Due to automatization this process can reduce workload of medical staff, as the algorithms alert for possible problems. We developed an integrated approach to monitor patients’ temperature applied to COVID-19 elderly patients and an ML process to identify abnormal behavior with alerts to physicians. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition where dopaminergic medication, such as levodopa, is typically used to improve motor symptoms, including mobility. Identifying the impact of levodopa on real-world motor state (e.g. ON/OFF/ DYSKINESIA) is important for both clinicians and people with PD. The aim of the present work was to automatically classify medication states using machine learning models. Continuous 7-day data were collected in 26 people with PD using an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) placed on the fifth lumbar vertebrae (L5) level. Over the week, each participant was asked to complete a diary by annotating medication states (off-condition and dyskinesias) with a 30-minute resolution. Diary entries were used as reference labels assigned to the processed IMU data. Two different networks were chosen for the classification: the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm (kNN) to identify ON-OFF-DYSKINESIA classes and Fine Tree (FT) to identify only OFF and ON classes. Preliminary results demonstrate that IMU data paired with machine learning could accurately classify ON-OFF and DYSKINESIA with 84% accuracy and the ON-OFF states were classified with 95% accuracy. These results are encouraging and pave the way to a better understanding of the effect that medication has on motor symptoms in PD during everyday life and may serve as a useful tool for optimizing clinical management of people with PD. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - There are no clear guidelines for diuretic administration in heart failure (HF), and reliable markers are needed to tailor treatment. Continuous monitoring of multiple advanced physiological parameters during diuresis may allow better differentiation of patients into subgroups according to their responses. In this study, 29 HF patients were monitored during outpatient intravenous diuresis, using a noninvasive wearable multi-parameter monitor. Analysis of changes in these parameters during the course of diuresis aimed to recognize subgroups with different response patterns. Parameters did not change significantly, however, subgroup analysis of the last quartile of treatment showed significant differences in cardiac output, cardiac index, stroke volume, pulse rate, and systemic vascular resistance according to gender, and in systolic blood pressure according to habitus. Changes in the last quartile could be differentiated using k-means, a technique of unsupervised machine learning. Moreover, patients’ responses could be best clustered into four groups. Analysis of baseline parameters showed that two of the clusters differed by baseline parameters, body mass index, and diabetes status. To conclude, we show that physiological changes during diuresis in HF patients can be categorized into subgroups sharing similar response trends, making noninvasive monitoring a potential key to personalized treatment in HF. © 2022 by the authors.

The newly established tools have been steered toward a new era of decentralized healthcare. The advancement of a telemedicine wearable monitoring system has attracted enormous interest in the multimodal big data acquisition of real-time physiological and biochemical information via noninvasive methods for any health-related industries. The expectation of telemedicine wearable creation has been focused on early diagnosis of multiple diseases and minimizing the cost of high-tech and invasive treatments. However, only limited progress has been directed toward the development of telemedicine wearable sensors. This Perspective addresses the advancement of these wearable sensors that encounter multiple challenges on the forefront and technological gaps hampering the realization of health monitoring at molecular levels related to smart materials mostly limited to single use, issues of selectivity to analytes, low sensitivity to targets, miniaturization, and lack of artificial intelligence to perform multiple tasks and secure big data transfer. Sensor stability with minimized signal drift, on-body sensor reusability, and long-term continuous health monitoring provides key analytical challenges. This Perspective also focuses on, promotes, and highlights wearable sensors with a distinct capability to interconnect with telemedicine healthcare for physical sensing and multiplex sensing at deeper levels. Moreover, it points out some critical challenges in different material aspects and promotes what it will take to advance the current state-of-art wearable sensors for telemedicine healthcare. Ultimately, this Perspective is to draw attention to some potential blind spots of wearable technology development and to inspire further development of this integrated technology in mitigating multimorbidity in aging societies through health monitoring at molecular levels to identify signs of diseases. © 2023 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Agriculture, healthcare, and manufacturing all use the Internet of Things. In recent years, smartwatches in healthcare monitoring have proliferated. This inspired the IoMT (IoT) network. Early disease identification by the IoMT reduces mortality. Clinical statistics must address cardiovascular disease prediction. The planned study would employ machine learning to identify heart disease risk factors. Several heart disease studies have shown limited accuracy. This research develops a cardiovascular disease diagnosis model using AI and IoT convergence. The model includes data collection, preliminary processing, classification, and parameter tuning. Wearables and other Internet of Things devices, including sensors, seamlessly gather data, which artificial intelligence uses to identify ailments. The recommended technique uses a Cuttlefish-based Cascaded Long Short-Term Memory (MCFA-CLSTM) model for illness diagnosis. MCFA adjusts CLSTM model 'weights' and 'bias' parameters. This improves medical data classification. MCFA improves CLSTM model diagnostics. Healthcare data verified the MCFA-CLSTM model. The MCFA-LSTM model diagnosed cardiac illness with 97.26% accuracy. Thus, advanced healthcare systems may use the MCFA-LSTM model to identify sickness. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - The rapid progress in advanced functional fibers (AFFs) offers unique superiorities in wearable electronics, artificial intelligence, and healthcare monitoring. However, there remain considerable challenges for AFFs to fulfill specific requirements of advanced applications due to their low electrical outputs, limitation in materials selection, and difficulty in regulating microstructures on narrow and curved surface of the fibers. In this study, fabricating and regulating honeycomb porous microstructures (HPMs) on one-dimensional nonplanar fiber surfaces were proposed and systematically studied for developing AFFs with customized functionalities. As a demonstration of application, multifunctional silver-plated nylon fibers surface-engineered with HPMs (SNF@HPMs) were developed with the assistance of the BF method and were further fabricated into SNF@HPMs-based triboelectric nanogenerator (SNF@HPMs-TENG). The SNF@HPMs-TENG showed considerable electrical performances with a power density of 390.8 mW/m2 and good long-term stability, which can power portable electronics as capacitors, calculator, watch, and light up 150 LEDs. Moreover, a self-powered wearable sensor based on SNF@HPMs was also developed for monitoring the bending, tactile, and frictional stimuli in a real-time manner. The comprehension of HPMs mechanism on nonplanar fiber surface and demonstrated capability of the SNF@HPMs-TENG provide insights and guidance in regulating microstructures of fiber materials for developing AFFs with customizable functionalities. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Human life has become smarter by utilizing big data, telecommunication technologies, and wearable sensors over pervasive computing to give better healthcare services. Big data is built with the possibility to improve the healthcare industry. Big data makes the interconnection between patients, wearable sensors, healthcare caregivers, and providers through the utilization of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and software. Most of the economic challenges in developing countries are caused by the healthcare sector, which occurs predominantly due to the increasing population requiring more quality of care concerning older people. Older people need great attention and care as they lead with irreparable damages when a minor accident or insignificant disease occurs. Therefore, the necessity of implementing new technologies and tools has arisen to support senior citizens regarding their healthcare. Various advancements in wireless technology, miniaturization, computing power, and processing made diverse healthcare innovations that led to developing the connected medical devices. Hence, this proposal develops a new healthcare monitoring system for tracking the activities of elderly people, where the Hadoop MapReduce technique for parallel processing the large-sized data. The data collected as mentioned in the available datasets is performed by using the numerous wearable sensors fixed on the ‘‘subject’s left ankle, right arm, and chest’’ that are transformed to the cloud platform and also to the data analytics layer according to the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices. The given input undergoes data splitting to produce tiny chunks. These small chunks of the input files are then considered as Map tasks. Here, in the map phase, the features are optimally selected by the Hybrid Dingo Coyote Optimization (HDCO). The combiner phase classifies the physical activities using the developed Deep Ensemble Learning (DEL) consisting of classifiers such as ‘‘Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long short-term memory (LSTM), Deep Belief Network (DBN), and Deep Neural Network (DNN)’’. The parameter tuning in these classifiers is done by the same HDCO. The reducer phase extracts data from different chunks by merging the same classes. The developed HDCO-DEL has secured 13.66%, 16.01%, 17.33%, 13.6%, and 14.01% better accuracy than ELM, CNN, LSTM, DBN, DNN, and HealthFog, respectively on second dataset. The comparison with existing methods shows its better performance and also predicts physical activities with overall high accuracy. 2023 The Authors.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of remote patient monitoring, particularly for those suffering from chronic illnesses. Such individuals require continuous monitoring to ensure the stability of their condition and prevent complications. However, traditional methods of patient monitoring can be invasive, time-consuming, and often result in patients feeling limited in their daily activities. The development of intelligent monitoring systems based on Internet of Things technologies has the potential to revolutionize the way chronic illness is managed. These systems can be integrated with wearable/portable devices and other sensors to track vital signs in real-time. This information can then be transmitted to healthcare providers for review, allowing for early detection of any changes or potential issues. The benefits of such systems are numerous. They provide patients with increased freedom and mobility, as they no longer need to visit a healthcare facility for regular check-ups. They also reduce the workload for healthcare providers, freeing up time for more critical cases. Furthermore, they can result in cost savings for healthcare systems by reducing the need for hospitalization. This work introduces the SMART CARE project that aims to develop an integrated monitoring system consisting of hardware and software components that can make the various phases of managing a patient with chronic heart failure (prevention, diagnosis, therapy, follow-up) more efficient. The paper provides the main information on the project and presents and describes the system architecture of the proposed solution.  © 2023 University of Split, FESB.

AB  - The Network of Effective Treatment (IoMT) model is used in various clinical trials and other healthcare operations. It is based on a novel set of ultraprecise tiny sensing devices and communication infrastructures, which give unmatched data collecting and ongoing vital sign capabilities. To fully realize the technology’s promise, however, some progress is required. First and foremost, the edge-computing paradigm must be considered. A definite amount of manufacturing in the vicinity of the detector must be permitted to enhance versatility and usability, dependability, and the IoMT terminals’ availability. Second, newer, more techniques for efficient information analysis, such as those that are specially adapted intelligence and deep learning, must be used. IoMT node designers and programmers must overcome severe optimization issues to conduct moderately complicated computing operations on flexible and wearable computing with low-power consumption devices with restricted power and battery lives to achieve these aims. This work investigates the creation of an examination of intellectual data methods for computer systems with limited resources by dynamically controlling the vehicle’s hardware and software configuration and adapting it to the necessary operating mode at runtime. A low-power microcontroller and a neural network model is employed to categorize cardiac data to test this strategy. It is observed that adjusting the node architecture to the strain at execution can be reduced to 50% in power utilization using the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia set as a testbed. A quantized neural network could diagnose arrhythmia disorders with a 98 percent accuracy rate. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Today's healthcare sectors are driven and work to rescue patients as soon as possible by giving them the right care and treatment. A healthcare monitoring system works in two ways: by keeping track of the patient's activities and overall health. For prompt treatment, such as giving the right and suitable medication, administering an injection, and providing additional medical help, nursing supervision is required. Wearable sensors are fixed or connected to the patient's body and can follow their health. These IoT medical gadgets let clinicians diagnose patients and comprehend the processes from remote. However, the amount of data produced by IoT devices is so large that it cannot be handled manually. A model for automated analysis is required. Convolution Neural Network with Long-Short Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) was therefore suggested in this study as a Hybrid Deep Learning Framework (HDLF) for a Patient Activity Monitoring System (PAMS) that brings all healthcare activities with its classes. To incorporate medical specialists from all over the world and enhance treatment outcomes, the framework offers an advanced model where patient activities, health conditions, medications, and other activities are distributed in the cloud. An effective architecture for Wearable Sensor Network-based Human Action Recognition that combines neural network Simple Recurrent Units (SRUs) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs). For assessing the multimodal data input sequence, deep SRUs and a variety of internal memory states is utilized in this research. Furthermore, for addressing the concerns about accuracy oscillations or instability with decreasing gradients, a deep GRUs to store and learn the knowledge is conveyed to the future state. The analysis suggests that CNN-LSTM is then contrasted with some of the currently used algorithms, and it is found that the new system has a 99.53% accuracy rate. The difference between this accuracy result and the current value is at least 4.73%.  © 2023 - IOS Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) enables remote patient monitoring (RPM) which reduces costs by triaging patients to optimize hospitalization and avoid complications. The FDA regulates AI in medical devices and aims to ensure patient safety, effectiveness, and transparent AI solutions. Objectives: Identify and summarize FDA approved RPM devices to provide information for the US medical device industry based on previous approvals and the markets’ needs. Methods: We searched publicly available databases on FDA-approved RPM devices. Selection criteria were established to classify a solution as AI. Technical information was analyzed on pre-identified 16 parameters for the qualified solutions. Results: A total of 47 RPM devices were reviewed, among which 12.8% were classified as a De Novo product and the remaining devices fell under the 510(K) FDA category. The cardiovascular (74%) AI RPM solutions dominated the US market, followed by ECG-based arrhythmia detection algorithms (59.4%), and Hemodynamics and Vital Sign monitoring algorithms (21.9%). The trend observed in the FDA rejected devices was their inability to be classified into clinically relevant categories (Criteria 2 and 3). Conclusion: The market needs more innovative RPM solutions under the De Novo category, as there are very few. The transparency is low on the technical aspect of AI algorithms. The market needs AI algorithms that can effectively classify patients rather than merely improve device functionality. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) for medical purposes offers a number of benefits, including the aptitude to follow the individual's physical state over a range of time intervals and transmitting data in real time. Using gadgets like glucose meters, heart monitoring implants, Electrocardiogram (ECG), blood pressure monitors, Electroencephalography (EEG) and Electromyography (EMG) wearable strategies, medical personnel can gather local patient wellness data and make choices based on it. The IoT devices' weak authentication and encryption procedures make them readily hackable and may expose users to a number of risks, some of which could be fatal. The Quality of Service (QoS) needs for healthcare IoT devices, such as dependability, authorization, identity and security, cannot be met by current algorithms using machine learning or blockchain approaches operating in the cloud computing environment. Henceforth the proposed work develops an advanced Fog computing (FC) to oppose advance cloud computing at an edge of networks together with Block chain topology. Fog computing has been emphasized as promising method for low-cost remote monitoring, limiting down on latency, and boosting efficiency, while blockchain has been touted for guaranteeing the security of private data, building a decentralized database, and improving data interoperability. The problem of healthcare IoT device recognition, permission and confirmation for scalability often broadcast of data in a distributed setting can be handled by merging FC with block chain. So, leveraging FC and blockchain, a creative solution to the aforementioned issue. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - The age profiles of many countries are increasing day by day with increasing population of individuals affected by the chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity and so on. In order to maintain the individual living, remote health monitoring with daily activity by recognising people is a promising solution. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the major cause of mortality globally. Most of the deaths due to CVD are sudden and without any chance of medical help. In order to avoid this accidental death, precautions are required with continuous monitoring of body parameters such as heart rate, pulse rate and electrocardiogram (ECG) to show the current status of the health. Internet of Things (IoT) is rapidly growing industry in many disciplines including healthcare. In current research, heart disease is monitored with processing of electrocardiogram signals. The existing monitoring system lacks in prediction accuracy and remote monitoring. In this proposed work, the gathered data from the wearable devices are preprocessed to remove the noise. The relevant features for better recognition are selected using the proposed LBPNet with particle swarm optimisation (PSO). Then sequential minimal optimisation based SVM classifier recognises the abnormalities of heart disease from normal patients for diagnosis. These data are available in remote servers for doctors and care takers with IoT application. The care takers are notified about the patient health using smart phones. This proposed system is useful for cardiac patient monitoring and updation with high accuracy. Copyright © 2023 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - In the era of pervasive computing and wearable technology, the accurate recognition of human activities has gained paramount importance across a spectrum of applications, from healthcare monitoring to smart environments. This paper introduces a novel methodology that leverages the fusion of multi-sensor data with deep learning techniques to enhance the precision and robustness of human activity recognition. Our approach commences with the transformation of accelerometer and gyroscope time-series data into recurrence plots, facilitating the distillation of temporal patterns and dependencies. Subsequently, a dual-path convolutional network framework is employed to extract intricate sensory patterns independently, followed by an attention module that fuses these features, capturing their nuanced interactions. Rigorous experimental evaluations, including comparative analyses against traditional machine learning baselines, validate the superior performance of our methodology. The results demonstrate remarkable classification performance, underscoring the efficacy of our approach in recognizing a diverse range of human activities. Our research not only advances the state-of-the-art in activity recognition but also highlights the potential of deep learning and multi-sensor data fusion in enabling context-aware systems for the benefit of society. © 2023, American Scientific Publishing Group (ASPG).

AB  - Conventional electromagnetic (EM) sensing techniques such as radar and LiDAR are widely used for remote sensing, vehicle applications, weather monitoring, and clinical monitoring. Acoustic techniques such as sonar and ultrasound sensors are also used for consumer applications, such as ranging and in vivo medical/healthcare applications. It has been of long-term interest to doctors and clinical practitioners to realize continuous healthcare monitoring in hospitals and/or homes. Physiological and biopotential signals in real-time serve as important health indicators to predict and prevent serious illness. Emerging electromagnetic-acoustic (EMA) sensing techniques synergistically combine the merits of EM sensing with acoustic imaging to achieve comprehensive detection of physiological and biopotential signals. Further, EMA enables complementary fusion sensing for challenging healthcare settings, such as real-world long-term monitoring of treatment effects at home or in remote environments. This article reviews various examples of EMA sensing instruments, including implementation, performance, and application from the perspectives of circuits to systems. The novel and significant applications to healthcare are discussed. Three types of EMA sensors are presented: (1) Chip-based radar sensors for health status monitoring, (2) Thermo-acoustic sensing instruments for biomedical applications, and (3) Photoacoustic (PA) sensing and imaging systems, including dedicated reconstruction algorithms were reviewed from time-domain, frequency-domain, time-reversal, and model-based solutions. The future of EMA techniques for continuous healthcare with enhanced accuracy supported by artificial intelligence (AI) is also presented.  © 2007-2012 IEEE.

AB  - The healthcare domain is one of the fastest-growing fields for the Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence. The advancement of medical resources is insufficient to meet the needs of remote patient monitoring and treatment. This issue is growing increasingly prevalent in developing countries. The convergence of IoT and AI solves this problem significantly. A remote monitoring system for breast cancer patients is urgently needed in order to provide effective care to them. This study examines related research on existing and future technologies for breast cancer detection, and how the confluence of IoT and AI is leading to the emergence of smart healthcare. Various breast cancer screening approaches have been briefly addressed, as well as popular public databases. Following that, issues in remote monitoring system have been discussed. We also present a case study on remote monitoring system for breast cancer patients to provide enhanced solution for women in rural areas. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Digital health and telemonitoring have resulted in a wealth of information to be collected to monitor, manage, and improve human health. The multi-source mixed-frequency health data overwhelm the modeling capacity of existing statistical and machine learning models, due to many challenging properties. Although predictive analytics for big health data plays an important role in telemonitoring, there is a lack of rigorous prediction model that can automatically predicts patients’ health conditions, e.g., Disease Severity Indicators (DSIs), from multi-source mixed-frequency data. Sleep disorder is a prevalent cardiac syndrome that is characterized by abnormal respiratory patterns during sleep. Although wearable devices are available to administrate sleep studies at home, the manual scoring process to generate the DSI remains a bottleneck in automated monitoring and diagnosis of sleep disorder. To address the multi-fold challenges for precise prediction of the DSI from high-dimensional multi-source mixed-frequency data in sleep disorder, we propose a sparse linear mixed model that combines the modified Cholesky decomposition with group lasso penalties to enable joint group selection of fixed effects and random effects. A novel Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm integrated with an efficient Majorization Maximization (MM) algorithm is developed for model estimation of the proposed sparse linear mixed model with group variable selection. The proposed method was applied to the SHHS data for telemonitoring and diagnosis of sleep disorder and found that a few significant feature groups that are consistent with prior medical studies on sleep disorder. The proposed method also outperformed a few benchmark methods with the highest prediction accuracy. © 2023 “IISE”.

AB  - Neurological diseases including stroke and neurodegenerative disorders cause a hefty burden on the healthcare system. Survivors experience significant impairment in mobility and daily activities, which requires extensive rehabilitative interventions to assist them to regain lost skills and restore independence. The advent of remote rehabilitation architecture and enabling technology mandates the elaboration of sensing mechanisms tailored to individual clinical needs. This study aims to review current trends in the application of sensing mechanisms in remote monitoring and rehabilitation in neurological diseases, and to provide clinical insights to develop bespoke sensing mechanisms. A systematic search was performed using the PubMED database to identify 16 papers published for the period between 2018 to 2022. Teleceptive sensors (56%) were utilized more often than wearable proximate sensors (50%). The most commonly used modality was infrared (38%) and acceleration force (38%), followed by RGB color, EMG, light and temperature, and radio signal. The strategy adopted to improve the sensing mechanism included a multimodal sensor, the application of multiple sensors, sensor fusion, and machine learning. Most of the stroke studies utilized biofeedback control systems (78%) while the majority of studies for neurodegenerative disorders used sensors for remote monitoring (57%). Functional assessment tools that the sensing mechanism may emulate to produce clinically valid information were proposed and factors affecting user adoption were described. Lastly, the limitations and directions for further development were discussed. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - A smart healthcare network can use sensors and the Internet of Things (IoT) to enhance patient care while decreasing healthcare expenditures. It has become more difficult for healthcare providers to keep track and analyze the massive amounts of data it generates. Health care data created by IoT devices and e-health systems must be handled more efficiently. A wide range of healthcare industries can benefit from machine learning (ML) algorithms in the digital world. However, each of these algorithms has to be taught to anticipate or solve a certain problem. IoT-enabled healthcare data and health monitoring-based machine learning algorithms (IoT-HDHM-MLA) have been proposed to solve the difficulties faced by healthcare providers. Sensors and IoT devices are vital for monitoring an individual's health. The proposed IoT-HDHM-MLA aims to deliver healthcare services via remote monitoring with experts and machine learning algorithms. In this system, patients are monitored in real-time for various key characteristics using a collection of small wireless wearable nodes. The health care business benefits from systematic data collection and efficient data mining. Thus, the experimental findings demonstrate that IoT-HDHM-MLA enhances efficiency in patient health surveillance. © 2023 - IOS Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Due to COVID-19, the attempt to access medical facilities has increased. But, physical meetings are the biggest reason for the global pandemic. The healthcare industry is in a dire state of despair because of the spread of COVID, constrained health workers, and infrastructure. Healthcare accommodations are costlier than ever due to various reasons such as the global population getting busier and the rise in the number of chronic diseases. Nowadays, there is a high demand for healthcare support due to the increase in the aging population, the COVID-19 crisis, its postdisease difficulties, and other chronic diseases. Treating all the patients at hospitals is not practical nowadays due to limited healthcare facilities. The patients' care is all dependent on visits to the hospital physically, and to some extent, calls, text messages, and emails. This way it was not possible for the doctors to monitor the health of the patients continuously and assist them whenever needed. Recently, the Internet of Things (IoT) and various machine learning approaches have been widely explored in this sector. The IoT-based healthcare methods provide quality and efficiency during treatment. The IoT along with machine learning techniques can transform the healthcare industry by making it more accessible and less costly and make healthcare more facile by equipping the users with pocket amicable medical facilities. With IoT-enabled devices, remote monitoring can enable patients to better connect with doctors, thereby minimizing physical visits. It can equip doctors to easily keep track of their patient's health by utilizing wearables like fitness bands that can monitor various healthcare parameters. All these systems mostly use machine learning or deep learning approaches. This way, they will know whether to offer any immediate medical care or to make any changes to the current treatment. This chapter gives a detailed discussion on IoT and machine learning in the healthcare sector and the security concerns in this domain along with the major research challenges. © 2023 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - In next-generation network architecture, the Cybertwin drove the sixth generation of cellular networks sixth-generation (6G) to play an active role in many applications, such as healthcare and computer vision. Although the previous sixth-generation (5G) network provides the concept of edge cloud and core cloud, the internal communication mechanism has not been explained with a specific application. This article introduces a possible Cybertwin based multimodal network (beyond 5G) for electrocardiogram (ECG) patterns monitoring during daily activity. This network paradigm consists of a cloud-centric network and several Cybertwin communication ends. The Cybertwin nodes combine support locator/identifier identification, data caching, behavior logger, and communications assistant in the edge cloud. The application focuses on monitoring the ECG patterns during daily activity because few studies analyze them under different motions. We present a novel deep convolutional neural network based human activity recognition classifier to enhance identification accuracy. The healthcare monitoring values and potential clinical medicine are provided by the Cybertwin based network for ECG patterns observing.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Wearable sensors in healthcare monitoring have recently found widespread applications in biomedical fields for their non- or minimal-invasive, user-friendly and easy-accessible features. Sensing materials is one of the major challenges to achieve these superiorities of wearable sensors for healthcare monitoring, while graphene-based materials with many favorable properties have shown great efficiency in sensing various biochemical and biophysical signals. In this paper, we review state-of-the-art advances in the development and modification of graphene-based materials (i.e., graphene, graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide) for fabricating advanced wearable sensors with 1D (fibers), 2D (films) and 3D (foams/aerogels/hydrogels) macroscopic structures. We summarize the structural design guidelines, sensing mechanisms, applications and evolution of the graphene-based materials as wearable sensors for healthcare monitoring of biophysical signals (e.g., mechanical, thermal and electrophysiological signals) and biochemical signals from various body fluids and exhaled gases. Finally, existing challenges and future prospects are presented in this area. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Although there is interest in wearables and smartphone technologies for remote outcome monitoring, little is known regarding the willingness of hip osteoarthritis (OA) and/or total hip arthroplasty (THA) patients to authorize and adhere to such treatment. Methods: We developed an Institutional Review Board–approved questionnaire to evaluate patient perceptions of remote monitoring technologies in a high-volume orthopedic center. Forty-seven THA patients (60% female; mean age: 66 years) and 50 nonoperative OA hip patients (52% female; mean age: 63 years) participated. Patient perceptions were compared using Pearson's chi-squared analyses. Results: THA patients were similarly interested in the use of smartphone apps (91% vs 94%, P =.695) in comparison to nonoperative hip OA patients. THA patients were more receptive to using wearable sensors (94% vs 44%, P <.001) relative to their nonoperative counterparts. THA patients also expressed stronger interest in learning to use custom wearables (87% vs 32%, P <.001) vs nonoperative patients. Likewise, the majority of THA patients were willing to use Global Positioning System technology (74% vs 26%, P <.001). THA patients also expressed willingness to have their body movement (89%), balance (89%), sleep (87%), and cardiac output (91%) tracked using remote technology. Conclusion: Overall, we found that THA patients were highly receptive to using wearable technology in their treatments. Nonoperative OA hip patients were generally unreceptive to using smart technologies, with the exception of smartphone applications. This information may be useful as utilization of these technologies for patient care continues to evolve. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In this paper, we present an AI-driven lifestyle intervention service for patients with hypertension. The automated intervention platform consists of a remote monitoring system that ingests lifestyle and blood pressure (BP) data and builds a personalized machine learning (ML) model to generate tailored lifestyle recommendations most relevant to each patient's BP. Lifestyle data is collected from a wearable device and questionnaire mobile app which includes activity, sleep, stress and diet information. BP data is remotely collected using at-home BP monitors. With this data, the system trains random forest models that predict BP from lifestyle features and uses Shapley Value analysis to estimate the impact of features on BP. Precise lifestyle recommendations are generated based on the top lifestyle factors for each patient. To test the system's ability to improve BP, we enrolled hypertensive patients into a three-armed clinical trial. During the 6-month trial period, our system provided weekly recommendations to patients in the experimental group. We evaluate the system's effectiveness based on multiple BP improvement metrics and comparison with a control group. Patients in the experimental group experienced an average BP change of -4.0 and -4.7 mmHg for systolic and diastolic BP, respectively, compared to -0.3 and -0.9 mmHg for the control group. Our results demonstrate that the platform can effectively help patients improve their BP through precise lifestyle recommendations.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - To track vital signs on the wrist, a wearable system, named WrisTee, has been developed for remote health monitoring. Using three optical sensors with four light sources, WrisTee allows users to measure 12 photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals at three locations on the radial artery. Two types of PPG signals with opposite polarities were discovered and designated as in-phase and invert-phase signals. We provided a unified viewpoint regarding their differences based on the Beer $-$ Lambert law, and showed that both signals can be used for heart monitoring using data analyzed from a selected subject. Using reflective pulse-transition time (R-PTT) and the standard deviation of R-PTT ($\sigma _{R\text{-}PTT}$), we proposed a method for selecting the optimal wavelength to achieve the best quality signal, thus minimizing storage requirements, power resources, and computational costs. We conducted an experiment on ten subjects to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed method. Our results demonstrated that WrisTee is capable of finding the optimal positions and wavelengths for monitoring vital signs. To automatically detect the PPG phases, six machine learning (ML) models were explored to assess their accuracy for PPG-phase classification. The experimental results show that a convolutional neural network can be the best candidate for phase classification. Hence, it can be integrated into WrisTee for noninvasive health monitoring such as heart rate, heart rate variability, or blood pressure. Our work paves a new direction in bio-signal medical researches by adopting in-phase and invert-phase PPGs for healthcare monitoring. © 2009-2012 IEEE.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) development made it possible for technology to communicate physical education by connecting cost-effective heterogeneous devices and digital applications to uncontrolled and accessible environments. The traditional physical education monitoring environment creates crucial manual efforts on athletes' activity observations and tracking consistently. Similarly, remote monitoring and assessment of athletes in sports training seem to be barriers to physical education monitoring and training. It creates various chances to improve training and education through technology advancements like IoT and deep learning. Students can efficiently monitor their physical behavior to increase their physical and psychological benefits. The IoT-assisted physical activity monitoring device is proposed to track students' physical activity and enhance outcomes. The management ability allows students to organize and increase speed their physical activity in a wellness manner. In addition, this study examines the connections between monitoring ability which is an essential component for sports activities and physical activity. This system collects essential information from IoT-based wearable devices that interact with the data in real time by virtualizing the device. The IoT network includes several device activities and monitors the heartbeat and physical body temperature of a person. The analysis of specific studies and student feedback shows that the designed virtual system of physical educations is effective in its application and implementation and provides a reliable guide for developing student physical educational systems. The experimental analysis is evaluated; the solution offered is developing and supporting physical education and training approaches in reality and creates healthy environment systems to solve the health monitoring challenges posed by IoT devices. The proposed method has achieved extraordinary physical activity monitoring compared to the conventional systems, as shown by experimental findings. The simulation analysis of physical education can help students and improve the associated aspects of physical abilities with high accuracy ratio (98.3), prediction ratio (96.5%), interaction ratio (94.4%), performance ratio (95.1%), the efficiency ratio (93.2), F-score (92.2%), and reduce error rate (17.5%) and physical activity patterns. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Physiotherapy is a critical element in the successful conservative management of low back pain (LBP). A gold standard for quantitatively measuring physiotherapy participation is crucial to understanding physiotherapy adherence in managing recovery from LBP. Objective: This study aimed to develop and evaluate a system with wearable inertial sensors to objectively detect the performance of unsupervised exercises for LBP comprising movement in multiple planes and sitting postures. Methods: A quantitative classification design was used within a machine learning framework to detect exercise performance and posture in a cohort of healthy participants. A set of 8 inertial sensors were placed on the participants, and data were acquired as they performed 7 McKenzie low back exercises and 3 sitting posture positions. Engineered time series features were extracted from the data and used to train 9 models by using a 6-fold cross-validation approach, from which the best 2 models were selected for further study. In addition, a convolutional neural network was trained directly on the time series data. A feature importance analysis was performed to identify sensor locations and channels that contributed the most to the models. Finally, a subset of sensor locations and channels was included in a hyperparameter grid search to identify the optimal sensor configuration and best performing algorithms for exercise and posture classification. The final models were evaluated using the F1 score in a 10-fold cross-validation approach. Results: In total, 19 healthy adults with no history of LBP each completed at least one full session of exercises and postures. Random forest and XGBoost (extreme gradient boosting) models performed the best out of the initial set of 9 engineered feature models. The optimal hardware configuration was identified as a 3-sensor setup—lower back, left thigh, and right ankle sensors with acceleration, gyroscope, and magnetometer channels. The XGBoost model achieved the highest exercise (F1 score: mean 0.94, SD 0.03) and posture (F1 score: mean 0.90, SD 0.11) classification scores. The convolutional neural network achieved similar results with the same sensor locations, using only the accelerometer and gyroscope channels for exercise classification (F1 score: mean 0.94, SD 0.02) and the accelerometer channel alone for posture classification (F1 score: mean 0.88, SD 0.07). Conclusions: This study demonstrates the potential of a 3-sensor lower body wearable solution (eg, smart pants) that can identify exercises in multiple planes and proper sitting postures, which is suitable for the treatment of LBP. This technology has the potential to improve the effectiveness of LBP rehabilitation by facilitating quantitative feedback, early problem diagnosis, and possible remote monitoring. © Abdalrahman Alfakir, Colin Arrowsmith, David Burns, Helen Razmjou, Michael Hardisty, Cari Whyne.

AB  - Objective: With the increasing use of wearable healthcare devices for remote patient monitoring, reliable signal quality assessment (SQA) is required to ensure the high accuracy of interpretation and diagnosis on the recorded data from patients. Photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals non-invasively measured by wearable devices are extensively used to provide information about the cardiovascular system and its associated diseases. In this study, we propose an approach to optimize the quality assessment of the PPG signals. Methods: We used an ensemble-based feature selection scheme to enhance the prediction performance of the classification model to assess the quality of the PPG signals. Our approach for feature and subset size selection yielded the best-suited feature subset, which was optimized to differentiate between the clean and artifact corrupted PPG segments. Conclusion: A high discriminatory power was achieved between two classes on the test data by the proposed feature selection approach, which led to strong performance on all dependent and independent test datasets. We achieved accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity rates of higher than 0.93, 0.89, and 0.97, respectively, for dependent test datasets, independent of heartbeat type, i.e., atrial fibrillation (AF) or non-AF data including normal sinus rhythm (NSR), premature atrial contraction (PAC), and premature ventricular contraction (PVC). For independent test datasets, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity rates were greater than 0.93, 0.89, and 0.97, respectively, on PPG data recorded from AF and non-AF subjects. These results were found to be more accurate than those of all of the contemporary methods cited in this work. Significance: As the results illustrate, the advantage of our proposed scheme is its robustness against dynamic variations in the PPG signal during long-term 14-day recordings accompanied with different types of physical activities and a diverse range of fluctuations and waveforms caused by different individual hemodynamic characteristics, and various types of recording devices. This robustness instills confidence in the application of the algorithm to various kinds of wearable devices as a reliable PPG signal quality assessment approach.  © 1964-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Healthcare occupies a central role in sustainable societies and has an undeniable impact on the well-being of individuals. However, over the years, various diseases have adversely affected the growth and sustainability of these societies. Among them, heart disease is escalating rapidly in both economically settled and undeveloped nations and leads to fatalities around the globe. To reduce the death ratio caused by this disease, there is a need for a framework to continuously monitor a patient's heart status, essentially doing early detection and prediction of heart disease. This paper proposes a scalable Machine Learning (ML) and Internet of Things-(IoT-) based three-layer architecture to store and process a large amount of clinical data continuously, which is needed for the early detection and monitoring of heart disease. Layer 1 of the proposed framework is used to collect data from IoT wearable/implanted smart sensor nodes, which includes various physiological measures that have significant impact on the deterioration of heart status. Layer 2 stores and processes the patient data on a local web server using various ML classification algorithms. Finally, Layer 3 is used to store the critical data of patients on the cloud. The doctor and other caregivers can access the patient health conditions via an android application, provide services to the patient, and inhibit him/her from further damage. Various performance evaluation measures such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1-measure, MCC-score, and ROC curve are used to check the efficiency of our proposed IoT-based heart disease prediction framework. It is anticipated that this system will assist the healthcare sector and the doctors in diagnosing heart patients in the initial phases.  © 2022 Yar Muhammad et al.

AB  - Objective: To identify current patient and provider engagement methods that use technology in allergy and immunology clinics, in hospitals, and at home. Data Sources: Apple App Store and Google searches for allergy and immunology technology applications and PubMed search of literature involving keywords of website, technology, electronic health record, medical devices, disparity in technology, coding for remote patient monitoring, and artificial intelligence. Study Selections: Studies that addressed the keywords were included and narrowed down based on their applicability in the allergy and immunology clinic. Results: There has been rapid innovation in the digital health care space with expansion of electronic medical record services and the patient portal, creation of allergy and immunology–specific medical devices and applications with remote patient monitoring capabilities, and website and artificial intelligence development to interact with patients. Conclusion: These technological advances provide distinct advantages to the provider and patient but also have a burden of time for evaluation of the data for the provider and disparate access to certain technologies for patients. The development of these technologies has been fast-tracked since the start of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. With the explosion in telehealth and medical device development, advancement of medical technology is not revealing any signs of slowing down. It is paving a new way to interact with patients in the future. © 2021 American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology

AB  - Purpose: Wearables are gaining prominence in the health-care industry and their use is growing. The elderly and other patients can use these wearables to monitor their vitals at home and have them sent to their doctors for feedback. Many studies are being conducted to improve wearable health-care monitoring systems to obtain clinically relevant diagnoses. The accuracy of this system is limited by several challenges, such as motion artifacts (MA), power line interference, false detection and acquiring vitals using dry electrodes. This paper aims to focus on wearable health-care monitoring systems in the literature and provides the effect of MA on the wearable system. Also presents the problems faced while tracking the vitals of users. Design/methodology/approach: MA is a major concern and certainly needs to be suppressed. An analysis of the causes and effects of MA on wearable monitoring systems is conducted. Also, a study from the literature on motion artifact detection and reduction is carried out and presented here. The benefits of a machine learning algorithm in a wearable monitoring system are also presented. Finally, distinct applications of the wearable monitoring system have been explored. Findings: According to the study reduction of MA and multiple sensor data fusion increases the accuracy of wearable monitoring systems. Originality/value: This study also presents the outlines of design modification of dry/non-contact electrodes to minimize the MA. Also, discussed few approaches to design an efficient wearable health-care monitoring system. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) are at risk for the development of low cardiac output and other physiologic derangements, which could be detected early through continuous stroke volume (SV) measurement. Unfortunately, existing SV measurement methods are limited in the clinic because of their invasiveness (eg, thermodilution), location (eg, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging), or unreliability (eg, bioimpedance). Multimodal wearable sensing, leveraging the seismocardiogram, a sternal vibration signal associated with cardiomechanical activity, offers a means to monitoring SV conveniently, affordably, and continuously. However, it has not been evaluated in a population with significant anatomical and physiological differences (ie, children with CHD) or compared against a true gold standard (ie, cardiac magnetic resonance). Here, we present the feasibility of wearable estimation of SV in a diverse CHD population (N=45 patients). METHODS AND RESULTS: We used our chest-worn wearable biosensor to measure baseline ECG and seismocardiogram signals from patients with CHD before and after their routine cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging, and derived features from the measured signals, predominantly systolic time intervals, to estimate SV using ridge regression. Wearable signal features achieved acceptable SV estimation (28% error with respect to cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging) in a held-out test set, per cardiac output measurement guidelines, with a root-mean-square error of 11.48 mL and R2 of 0.76. Additionally, we observed that using a combination of electrical and cardiomechanical features surpassed the performance of either modality alone. CONCLUSIONS: A convenient wearable biosensor that estimates SV enables remote monitoring of cardiac function and may potentially help identify decompensation in patients with CHD. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - The continuous growth in wearable sensors technology has inspired researchers to design novel models for Human Activity Recognition (HAR). The wearable sensor-based HAR has covered various context-aware application areas, such as health care, surveillance, security, sports, military, and many more. The deep learning models have been widely used in HAR for their proven performance by automatically extracting the efficient features from the raw sensor data. The different source and destination subjects with their non-identical environment degrade the model’s performance, and the practical applicability remains a challenge. To tackle this, Inter-Domain Activities Analysis (IDAA)-based Deep-Transfer Heterogeneous HAR (DeepTransHHAR) model is proposed in this paper. The IDAA approach uses the Wasserstein distance metric for measuring the data distribution distance between the source and target subjects, and DeepTransHHAR model is used for feature extraction and activities recognition. Two publically available datasets HHAR and KU-HAR with non-identical properties in terms of the number of subjects, activities, wearable sensors (accelerometer and gyroscope), devices, and the sampling rates are used for experimental evaluation. The experimental result shows that the IDAA strategy helps to improve the HAR performance significantly in the non-identical environment. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The National Academy of Sciences, India.

AB  - Multifunctional tactile sensors that can mimic the sensory capabilities of human skin to perceive various external static and dynamic stimuli are essential to interact with the environment and humans for wearable electronics and soft intelligent robotics. Here, inspired by human skin, we report a textile-based tactile sensor capable of multifunctional sensing for personalized healthcare monitoring and soft robotic control. The tactile sensor consists of a triboelectric nanogenerator sensing layer to mimic the function of fast adapting (FA) mechanoreceptors and a piezoresistive sensing layer to achieve the functionality of slow adapting (SA) mechanoreceptors. The tactile sensor has been demonstrated to be able to recognize voice and monitor physiological signals and human motions in a real-time manner. Combined with a machine learning framework, the tactile sensor is able to percept surface textures and material types with high accuracy. It is also demonstrated as an effective human-machine interface for the control of assistive robotics. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Nowadays, digitization has opened up various possibilities in the healthcare sector. Smart healthcare is becoming a field of remarkable transformations and growth in the new era of smart cities and digitally interconnected societies. In smart healthcare systems, multiple sensors, devices, and sources are interconnected through networks and collect valuable data that gives insights about the patient's health status and ongoing health trends. Internet of Health Things (IoHT) is a concept that represents the identifiable sensors, devices, and sources connected to the internet and that can be utilized in various automated patient monitoring applications to provide remote healthcare services. This article aims to provide an IoHT driven deep learning-based system for non-invasive patient discomfort detection. The developed system comprises of an RGB camera device to identify discomfort in a patient's body instead of utilizing any wearable sensors or devices. In order to identify movement and discomfort, the system utilizes the YOLOv3 model to detect the patient's body and the Alphapose method to extract different keypoints information of the patient's body. Applying association rules, the detected keypoints are then converted into six central body organs. To detect a patient's discomfort, pairwise distance is measured between detected keypoints, and finally, time frame rules are applied to set a threshold in order to analyze movements as either associated with normal or discomfort conditions. The patient's body is monitored continuously for multiple frames, based on which comfort and discomfort levels are distinguished. Different video sequences are used for experimental evaluations; results reveal the effectiveness of the developed system by achieving a True Positive Rate of 95% with a 6% False Positive Rate. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

This paper presents a flexible wearable acceleration sensor for monitoring human motion by introducing the island–bridge configuration and serpentine interconnects. Compared with traditional wearable accelerometers, the flexible accelerometer proposed in this paper improves the wearing comfort while reducing the cost of the device. Simulation and experiments under bending, stretching, and torsion conditions demonstrate that the flexible performance of the flexible acceleration sensor can meet the needs of monitoring the daily movement of the human body, and it can work normally under various conditions. The measurement accuracy of the flexible acceleration sensor is verified by comparing it with the data of the commercial acceleration sensor. The flexible acceleration sensor can measure the acceleration and the angular velocity of the human body with six degrees of freedom and recognize the gesture and motion features according to the acceleration characteristics. The presented flexible accelerometers provide great potential in recognizing the motion features that are critical for healthcare monitoring and physical sports performance evaluation. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Background and Objectives: The healthcare industry is fast accepting the benefits of Internet of Medical Things (IoMTs) and incorporating the services in day-to-day activity. The objective of this review was to comprehensively review the IoMTs, briefly revisit the functioning architecture, classify, list the challenges and possible solutions, and suggest the future trends among IoMTs usage and implementation. Materials and Methods: During April 2021, an extensive search for articles for Internet of Medical Things (IoMTs), medical devices, Internet of Things (IoTs) with biosensors either in title or in keywords was done using PubMed, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, and Web of Science databases. Studies were categorized into two types: those evaluating the clinical outcomes of IoMTs and those evaluating the technological basis of IoMTs. Results: IoMT architecture was reviewed under four headings: sensors, IoT gateway/framework, machine learning, and reporting tools. IoMT classification based on place of usage (body centric IoMTs, hospital IoMTs with point of care kiosks, and ubiquitous IoMTs), based on the system-wise application (cardiovascular, renal, pulmonary, endocrine, medication) and based on outcomes (fitness-alone IoMTs, clinical grading and monitoring IoMTs, and remote patient monitoring IoMTs) is proposed. Conclusion: IoMTs can be classified based on the place of usage into body centric, hospital-based, and ubiquitous systems. Classification based on the body systems and sensors aids in first-hand information about the existing IoMTs. Challenges for effective implementation of IoMTs are interoperability, data privacy, security, regulatory, and infrastructural costs. The future is promising for IoMTs with robust technological improvement and effective implementation.  © 2022 Medical Journal of Babylon | Published by Wolters Kluwer-Medknow.

AB  - Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized health care delivery in recent years. There is an increase in research for advanced AI techniques, such as deep learning, to build predictive models for the early detection of diseases. Such predictive models leverage mobile health (mHealth) data from wearable sensors and smartphones to discover novel ways for detecting and managing chronic diseases and mental health conditions. Objective: Currently, little is known about the use of AI-powered mHealth (AIM) settings. Therefore, this scoping review aims to map current research on the emerging use of AIM for managing diseases and promoting health. Our objective is to synthesize research in AIM models that have increasingly been used for health care delivery in the last 2 years. Methods: Using Arksey and O'Malley's 5-point framework for conducting scoping reviews, we reviewed AIM literature from the past 2 years in the fields of biomedical technology, AI, and information systems. We searched 3 databases, PubsOnline at INFORMS, e-journal archive at MIS Quarterly, and Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Digital Library using keywords such as "mobile healthcare," "wearable medical sensors," "smartphones", and "AI." We included AIM articles and excluded technical articles focused only on AI models. We also used the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) technique for identifying articles that represent a comprehensive view of current research in the AIM domain. Results: We screened 108 articles focusing on developing AIM models for ensuring better health care delivery, detecting diseases early, and diagnosing chronic health conditions, and 37 articles were eligible for inclusion, with 31 of the 37 articles being published last year (76%). Of the included articles, 9 studied AI models to detect serious mental health issues, such as depression and suicidal tendencies, and chronic health conditions, such as sleep apnea and diabetes. Several articles discussed the application of AIM models for remote patient monitoring and disease management. The considered primary health concerns belonged to 3 categories: mental health, physical health, and health promotion and wellness. Moreover, 14 of the 37 articles used AIM applications to research physical health, representing 38% of the total studies. Finally, 28 out of the 37 (76%) studies used proprietary data sets rather than public data sets. We found a lack of research in addressing chronic mental health issues and a lack of publicly available data sets for AIM research. Conclusions: The application of AIM models for disease detection and management is a growing research domain. These models provide accurate predictions for enabling preventive care on a broader scale in the health care domain. Given the ever-increasing need for remote disease management during the pandemic, recent AI techniques, such as federated learning and explainable AI, can act as a catalyst for increasing the adoption of AIM and enabling secure data sharing across the health care industry. © 2022 JMIR Publications.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine Learning (ML) based Smart Healthcare Surveillance System (SHSS) enhances the monitoring service quality of the present healthcare sectors. Efficient SHSS for specially heart disease is a challenging task. It involves collecting data of vital parameters of the body from different sensors (wearable sensors, implanted sensors), then filtering that to remove less important data, and finally data analyzing for taking the decision to provide proper treatment. Diseases can be caused by changing lifestyle or changing in lifestyle may be the symptom of a disease. IoT can provide services not only for detecting heart disease for future but also it can serve in emergency situations. The primary goal of this surveillance system is to monitor changes in a patient’s health in order to predict heart disease and deliver appropriate medicine via an automated procedure in the real-time environment. The SHSS uses edge layer to provide real-time services and the cloud layer for further latency tolerable analysis. Security and privacy are inevitable part of SHSS as it works with sensitive data of the patients. So, data security and user access mechanism should be involved. In this paper we have proposed an architecture of SHSS for heart disease, and discussed and analyzed the efficiency of different ML algorithms for making prediction of heart disease. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Human Activity Recognition (HAR) that includes gait analysis may be useful for various rehabilitation and telemonitoring applications. Current gait analysis methods, such as wearables or cameras, have privacy and operational constraints, especially when used with older adults. Millimeter-Wave (MMW) radar is a promising solution for gait applications because of its low-cost, better privacy, and resilience to ambient light and climate conditions. This paper presents a novel human gait analysis method that combines the micro-Doppler spectrogram and skeletal pose estimation using MMW radar for HAR. In our approach, we used the Texas Instruments IWR6843ISK-ODS MMW radar to obtain the micro-Doppler spectrogram and point clouds for 19 human joints. We developed a multilayer Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize and classify five different gait patterns with an accuracy of 95.7 to 98.8% using MMW radar data. During training of the CNN algorithm, we used the extracted 3D coordinates of 25 joints using the Kinect V2 sensor and compared them with the point clouds data to improve the estimation. Finally, we performed a real-time simulation to observe the point cloud behavior for different activities and validated our system against the ground truth values. The proposed method demonstrates the ability to distinguish between different human activities to obtain clinically relevant gait information. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - A dual-channel single-mode-multi-mode-single-mode (SMS) fiber optic sensor encapsulated by polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was proposed for the first time, for the simultaneous monitoring of the brachial and radial arteries for accurate blood pressure prediction. With the help of the machine learning algorithm Support Vector Regression (SVR), the SMS fiber sensor can continuously and accurately monitor the systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Commercial sphygmomanometers are used to calibrate the accuracy of blood pressure measurement. Compared with the single-channel system, this system can extract more pulse wave features for blood pressure prediction, such as radial artery transit time (RPTT), brachial artery transit time (BPTT), and the transit time difference between the radial artery and the brachial artery (DBRPTT). The results show that the performance of dual-channel blood pressure monitoring is more accurate than that of single-channel blood pressure monitoring in terms of the absolute value of the correlation coefficient (R) and the average value of the difference between SBP and DBP. In addition, both the single-channel and dual-channel blood pressure monitoring are in line with the Association for the Advancement of Medical Devices (AAMI), but the average deviation (DM, 0.06 mmHg) and standard deviation (SD, 1.54 mmHg) of dual-channel blood pressure monitoring are more accurate. The blood pressure monitoring system has the characteristics of low cost, high sensitivity, non-invasive and capability for remote real time monitoring, which can provide effective solution for intelligent health monitoring in the era of artificial intelligence in the future. © 1983-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Background and Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic manifested the need of developing robust digital platforms for facilitating healthcare services such as consultancy, clinical therapies, real time remote monitoring, early diagnosis and future predictions. Innovations made using technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), edge computing, cloud computing and artificial intelligence are helping address this crisis. The urge for remote monitoring, symptom analysis and early detection of diseases lead to tremendous increase in the deployment of wearable sensor devices. They facilitate seamless gathering of physiological data such as electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, respiration traces (RESP), galvanic skin response (GSR), pulse rate, body temperature, photoplethysmograms (PPG), oxygen saturation (SpO2) etc. For diagnosis and analysis purpose, the gathered data needs to be stored. Wearable devices operate on batteries and have a memory constraint. In mHealth application architectures, this gathered data is hence stored on cloud based servers. While transmitting data from wearable devices to cloud servers via edge devices, a lot of energy is consumed. This paper proposes a deep learning based compression model SCAElite that reduces the data volume, enabling energy efficient transmission. Results: Stress Recognition in Automobile Drivers dataset and MIT-BIH dataset from PhysioNet are used for validation of algorithm performance. The model achieves a compression ratio of up to 300 fold with reconstruction errors within 8% over the stress recognition dataset and 106.34-fold with reconstruction errors within 8% over the MIT-BIH dataset. The computational complexity of SCAElite is 51.65% less compared to state-of-the-art deep compressive model. Conclusion: It is experimentally validated that SCAElite guarantees a high compression ratio with good quality restoration capabilities for physiological signal compression in mHealth applications. It has a compact architecture and is computationally more efficient compared to state-of-the-art deep compressive model. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - COVID-19 is a life-threatening contagious virus that has spread across the globe rapidly. To reduce the outbreak impact of COVID-19 virus illness, continual identification and remote surveillance of patients are essential. Medical service delivery based on the Internet of Things (IoT) technology backed up by the fog-cloud paradigm is an efficient and time-sensitive solution for remote patient surveillance. Conspicuously, a comprehensive framework based on Radio Frequency Identification Device (RFID) and body-wearable sensor technologies supported by the fog-cloud platform is proposed for the identification and management of COVID-19 patients. The J48 decision tree is used to assess the infection degree of the user based on corresponding symptoms. RFID is used to detect Temporal Proximity Interactions (TPI) among users. Using TPI quantification, Temporal Network Analysis is used to analyze and track the current stage of the COVID-19 spread. The statistical performance and accuracy of the framework are assessed by utilizing synthetically-generated data for 250,000 users. Based on the comparative analysis, the proposed framework acquired an enhanced measure of classification accuracy, and sensitivity of 96.68% and 94.65% respectively. Moreover, significant improvement has been registered for proposed fog-cloud-based data analysis in terms of Temporal Delay efficacy, Precision, and F-measure. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Development of predictive computational models of metabolism through mechanistic models is complex and resource demanding, and their personalization remains challenging. Data-driven models of human metabolism would constitute a reliable, fast, and continuously updating model for predictive analytics. Wearable devices, such as smart bands and impedance balances, allow the real time and remote monitoring of physiological parameters, providing for a flux of data carrying information on user metabolism. Here, we developed a data-driven model of end-user metabolism, the Personalized Metabolic Avatar (PMA), to estimate its personalized reactions to diets. PMA consists of a gated recurrent unit (GRU) deep learning model trained to forecast personalized weight variations according to macronutrient composition and daily energy balance. The model can perform simulations and evaluation of diet plans, allowing the definition of tailored goals for achieving ideal weight. This approach can provide the correct clues to empower citizens with scientific knowledge, augmenting their self-awareness with the aim to achieve long-lasting results in pursuing a healthy lifestyle. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - As more and more medical devices, including as mobile phones, sensors, and remote monitoring equipment, require Internet access, wireless networks have gained considerable traction in the healthcare sector. High-performance technologies, such as the forthcoming fifth generation/sixth generation (5G/6G), are needed for data transit to and from medical equipment in order to give patients with state-of-the-art medical treatments. Furthermore, much better optimization techniques must be used when creating its primary components. Intelligent system design affects how all medical equipment operates, which presents a challenging issue in medical applications. Using information from many sources, electronic health records are built and stored there. These data are compiled in several formats and techniques. There are various big data strategies that could be utilised to reconcile the conflicting data. Artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning methods can be used to forecast diseases or other problems using the knowledge gathered from big data analytics. With the advent of 5G, augmented reality, virtual reality and spatial computing are all enhanced, which has a profound effect on healthcare informatics by allowing for real-time remote monitoring. With the advent of 5G technologies, healthcare services can be provided over vast distances via a vast network of interconnected devices and high-performance computation. Disease detection and treatment using dynamic data can be accomplished with the help of deep learning techniques such as Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN). Deep convolutional neural networks that incorporate images of sick regions are frequently employed for classification tasks. © 2022 Kohat University of Science and Technology. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: Parkinson’s Disease comes on top among neurodegenerative diseases affecting 10 million worldwide. To detect Parkinson’s Disease in a prior state, gait analysis is an effective choice. However, monitoring of Parkinson’s Disease using gait analysis is time consuming and exhaustive for patients and physicians. To assess severity of symptoms, a rating scale called Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale is used. It determines mild and severe cases. Today, Parkinson’s Disease severity assessment is made in gait laboratories and by manual examination. These are time consuming and it is costly for health institutions to build and maintain laboratories. By using low-cost wearables and an effective model, aforementioned problems can be solved. Methods: We provide a computerized solution for quantifiable assessment of Parkinson’s Disease symptoms severity. By using wearable sensors, our framework can predict exact symptom values to assess Parkinson’s Disease severity. We propose a deep learning approach that utilizes Ground Reaction Force sensors. From sensor signals, features are extracted and fed to a hybrid deep learning model. This model is the combination of Convolutional Neural Networks and Locally Weighted Random Forest. Results: Proposed framework achieved 0.897, 3.009, 4.556 in terms of Correlation Coefficient, Mean Absolute Error and Root Mean Square Error, respectively. Proposed framework outperformed other machine and deep learning models. We also evaluated classification performance for disease detection. We outperformed most of the previous studies, achieving 99.5% accuracy, 98.7% sensitivity and 99.1% specificity. Conclusion: This is the first study to use a deep learning regression approach to predict exact symptom value of Parkinson’s Disease patients. Results show that this approach can be effectively employed as a disease severity assessment tool using wearable sensors. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Recently, Telehealth connects patients to vital healthcare services via remote monitoring, wireless communications, videoconferencing, and electronic consults. By increasing access to specialists and physicians, telehealth assists in ensuring patients receive the proper care at the right time and right place. Teleophthalmology is a study of telemedicine that provides services for eye care using digital medical equipment and telecommunication technologies. Multimedia computing with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) for telehealth has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our society, but several technical challenges should be resolved before this potential can be realized. Advances in artificial intelligence methods and tools reduce waste and wait times, provide service efficiency and better insights, and increase speed, the level of accuracy, and productivity in medicine and telehealth. Therefore, this study develops an XAI-enabled teleophthalmology for diabetic retinopathy grading and classification (XAITO-DRGC) model. The proposed XAITO-DRGC model utilizes OphthoAI IoMT headsets to enable remote monitoring of diabetic retinopathy (DR) disease. To accomplish this, the XAITO-DRGC model applies median filtering (MF) and contrast enhancement as a pre-processing step. In addition, the XAITO-DRGC model applies U-Net-based image segmentation and SqueezeNet-based feature extractor. Moreover, Archimedes optimization algorithm (AOA) with a bidirectional gated recurrent convolutional unit (BGRCU) is exploited for DR detection and classification. The experimental validation of the XAITO-DRGC method can be tested using a benchmark dataset and the outcomes are assessed under distinct prospects. Extensive comparison studies stated the enhancements of the XAITO-DRGC model over recent approaches. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Smartwatches are becoming more popular for recognizing and monitoring human actions in everyday life. These wearable devices are equipped with various IMU sensors for ubiquitous data processing and recording of human physical activity data. Sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) has risen to the top of the list of the most active research topic due to its widely real-life applications in various practical domains, such as healthcare monitoring, sports and exercise tracking, and misbehavior prevention. Many machine learning and deep learning approaches have been recently proposed to solve the problem of human activity recognition, focusing on activities of daily living. However, an exciting and challenging HAR topic deals with more complex human activities such as eating-related activities. This paper proposes a sensor-based HAR framework using data from eating-related activities recorded by a smartwatch sensor. In this framework, five d eep learning networks (CNN, LSTM, BiLSTM, Stacked LSTM, CNN-LSTM, and LSTM-CNN) are evaluated for their recognition of eating-related activities. To ensure the model's dependability, data from eating-related activities on the standard publicly available dataset WISDM-HARB are utilized to evaluate the proposed framework using state-of-the-art metrics: accuracy and confusion matrices. Experiment findings demonstrate that the S tacked LSTM model outperforms other deep learning models, achieving an accuracy of 97.37%. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Applying smartphones and smartwatches for Human ActivitiesRecognition (HAR) is beneficial for analyzing the participant's dailybehavior and identifying mishaps, such as fall detection, enabling early healthcare monitoring and fall detection. Numerous HAR studies have investigated different recognition models based on sensor data. Nonetheless, this research mainly focused on basic motions such as sitting, standing and walking. In actual settings, human actions are often accomplished in complex ways. This research will examine the recognition of complicated activities using CNN and LSTM networks as deep learning classifiers. Furthermore, this study presented hybrid CNN for enhancing the identification of complicated activities. We evaluated these deep learning classifiers using WISDM-HARB, a publically available benchmark HAR. This dataset used accelerometer and gyroscope data from smartphones and smartwatches to collect sensor data of complicated activities. The experiment demonstrates that all deep learning classifiers recognize basic actions more accurately than complicated ones. Also, it was observed that the hybrid CNN classifier presented had the most fantastic accuracy with 96.25%. According to the research, these classifiers are effective at recognizing basic activities, but their performance decreases as the sophistication of the actions increases. Nonetheless, hybrid CNN models are competent for handling complicated tasks.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Designing, producing, and implementing biosensors and monitoring vital signals is one of the necessities of today's technologies. In this article, a special monitoring module with a rechargeable battery power source and a software-based expandable platform on the web server for displaying and monitoring the Wearable Artificial Kidney (WAK) signals graphically, is presented. The proposed system, monitors and controls the performance of the device remotely, and it provides a reduction in costs and time savings. By implementing a hardware module, the vital and control signals are received from WAK sensors and using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol are sent. The proposed module can send the data by WIFI and GSM/GPRS. The desired module, while controlling WAK remotely, is equipped with a GPS that controls the geographic location of patients. To reduce the power consumption of this battery-powered module, it sends the location in a part-Time performance cycle. The proposed method, utilized artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm, to monitor the performance of the WAK and provide suitable control according to each patient's condition. Also, the AI algorithm utilizes the significant measured parameters of the sensors such as blood leakage and air bubble detectors, access, return, pre-filter and ultra-filter pressures, temperature, pump status, and battery level, leading to early detection and interventions to avoid hospitalizations that facilitate the management and increase the quality of the dialysis patients.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - The rapid development of communication technologies and expert systems have resulted in a large volume of medical data. Big data such as clinical data, omics data, and electronic health data are difficult to manage in real-time due to noise, large size, different formats, missing values and large features. Hence, it is more difficult for the health monitoring system to extract the correct information. Low quality and noisy data can lead to unnecessary treatment. To overcome these issues, we proposed Enriched Salp Swarm Optimization based Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (ESSOBiLSTM) to monitor health. This method consists of four layers, such as the data collection layer, data storage layer, data analytics, and presentation layer. The initial layer handles a variety of information from main sources: wearable sensor devices (WSD), social network data, and medical records (MR). The second layer stores all the collected data from WSD, MR, and social network data to the cloud server through the wireless network. The proposed framework for performing big data analytics steps like preprocessing, filtering, dimensionality reduction, and classification is performed in the third layer. In the final layer, the doctor analyzes the patient's condition based on the classification results of the enriched SSO-BiLSTM. Based on the evaluation report, the proposed ESSOBiLSTM gives an accuracy of 85%, precision of 80%, RMSE of 0.6, MAE of 0.58, recall of 85% and F-measure of 79%. As a result, ESSOBiLSTM has proven to be more effective in monitoring health in large datasets. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) has made it possible to diagnose and treat patients remotely, as well as to expedite the transportation of essential drugs and medical equipment to locations that are geographically separated. This has occurred at a time when society has become more socially distant. During the Ebola and COVID-19 outbreaks, the Internet of Things (IoT) technology was put to use in remote patient monitoring and the management of the vaccine cold chain. Concurrently, this study reflects on the variables that are required for IoT to scale. Since December 2019, the COVID-19 outbreak on a worldwide scale has developed into a significant problem. In order for medical treatment to be successful, it is essential to make a prompt and accurate diagnosis of persons who may be infected with the COVID-19 virus. In order to put a halt to the spread of COVID-19, it is important to construct an automated system that is based on deep transfer learning and is capable of detecting the virus based on chest X-rays. The authors of this study present an internet-of-things (IoT) system that makes use of ensemble deep transfer learning to diagnose COVID-19 patients at an earlier stage. It is feasible to keep an eye on potentially hazardous COVID-19 incidents as they occur so long as suitable procedures are adhered to. Inceptions A variety of different deep learning models are included into the framework that has been proposed for the Internet of Things. According to the findings of the study, the method that was suggested assisted radiologists in accurately and quickly identifying patients who could have COVID-19. The proposed effort focuses on developing an effective identification system based on the COVID-19 standard for use in an IoT setting.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Academics and the health community are paying much attention to developing smart remote patient monitoring, sensors, and healthcare technology. For the analysis of medical scans, various studies integrate sophisticated deep learning strategies. A smart monitoring system is needed as a proactive diagnostic solution that may be employed in an epidemiological scenario such as COVID-19. Consequently, this work offers an intelligent medicare system that is an IoT-empowered, deep learning-based decision support system (DSS) for the automated detection and categorization of infectious diseases (COVID-19 and pneumothorax). The proposed DSS system was evaluated using three independent standard-based chest X-ray scans. The suggested DSS predictor has been used to identify and classify areas on whole X-ray scans with abnormalities thought to be attributable to COVID-19, reaching an identification and classification accuracy rate of 89.58% for normal images and 89.13% for COVID-19 and pneumothorax. With the suggested DSS system, a judgment depending on individual chest X-ray scans may be made in approximately 0.01 s. As a result, the DSS system described in this study can forecast at a pace of 95 frames per second (FPS) for both models, which is near to real-time. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Various Human Activities are classified through time-series data generated by the sensors of wearable devices. Many real-time scenarios such as Healthcare Surveillance, Smart Cities and Intelligent surveillance etc. are based upon Human Activity Recognition. Despite the popularity of local features-based approaches and machine learning approaches, it fails to capture adequate temporal information. In this paper, the deep convolutional neural model has been proposed by combining external features, i.e. orientation invariant (||v||) and consecutive point trajectory information (||Δ v||) with tri-axis data of the accelerometer. The proposed external features based approach experimented on three different deep learning architecture, namely Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Convolution Long-Short Term Memory (ConvLSTM). Accuracy of the algorithms radically improve with the additional input feature ||v|| and ||Δ v|| along with tri-axis data of accelerometer. The results show that the performance of all three LSTM, CNN and ConvLSTM models is better to compare with the state of art methods on WISDOM dataset and Activity dataset also the performance of ConvLSTM is 98.41% for WISDOM dataset and 98.04 for activity dataset, which is higher than that of CNN and LSTM model used in this paper. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Over the last couple of years, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, many healthcare issues have been exacerbated, highlighting the paramount need to provide both reliable and affordable health services to remote locations by using the latest technologies such as video conferencing, data management, the secure transfer of patient information, and efficient data analysis tools such as machine learning algorithms. In the constant struggle to offer healthcare to everyone, many modern technologies find applicability in eHealth, mHealth, telehealth or telemedicine. Through this paper, we attempt to render an overview of what different technologies are used in certain healthcare applications, ranging from remote patient monitoring in the field of cardio-oncology to analyzing EEG signals through machine learning for the prediction of seizures, focusing on the role of artificial intelligence in eHealth. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Stair climb power (SCP) is a clinical measure of leg muscular function assessed in-clinic via the Stair Climb Power Test (SCPT). This method is subject to human error and cannot provide continuous remote monitoring. Continuous monitoring using wearable sensors may provide a more comprehensive assessment of lower-limb muscular function. In this work, we propose an algorithm to classify stair climbing periods and estimate SCP from a lower-back worn accelerometer, which strongly agrees with the clinical standard (r = 0.92, p < 0.001; ICC = 0.90, [0.82, 0.94]). Data were collected in-lab from healthy adults (n = 65) performing the four-step SCPT and a walking assessment while instrumented (accelerometer + gyroscope), which allowed us to investigate tradeoffs between sensor modalities. Using two classifiers, we were able to identify periods of stair ascent with >89% accuracy [sensitivity = >0.89, specificity = >0.90] using two ensemble machine learning algorithms, trained on accelerometer signal features. Minimal changes in model performances were observed using the gyroscope alone (±0–6% accuracy) versus the accelerometer model. While we observed a slight increase in accuracy when combining gyroscope and accelerometer (about +3–6% accuracy), this is tolerable to preserve battery life in the at-home environment. This work is impactful as it shows potential for an accelerometer-based at-home assessment of SCP. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - In recent days, research in human activity recognition (HAR) has played a significant role in healthcare systems. The accurate activity classification results from the HAR enhance the performance of the healthcare system with broad applications. HAR results are useful in monitoring a person's health, and the system predicts abnormal activities based on user movements. The HAR system's abnormal activity predictions provide better healthcare monitoring and reduce users' health issues. The conventional HAR systems use wearable sensors, such as inertial measurement unit (IMU) and stretch sensors for activity recognition. These approaches show remarkable performances to the user's basic activities such as sitting, standing, and walking. However, when the user performs complex activities, such as running, jumping, and lying, the sensor-based HAR systems have a higher degree of misclassification results due to the reading errors from sensors. These sensor errors reduce the overall performance of the HAR system with the worst classification results. Similarly, radiofrequency or vision-based HAR systems are not free from classification errors when used in real time. In this paper, we address some of the existing challenges of HAR systems by proposing a human image threshing (HIT) machine-based HAR system that uses an image dataset from a smartphone camera for activity recognition. The HIT machine effectively uses a mask region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN) for human body detection, a facial image threshing machine (FIT) for image cropping and resizing, and a deep learning model for activity classification. We demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed HIT machine-based HAR system through extensive experiments and results. The proposed HIT machine achieved 98.53% accuracy when the ResNet architecture was used as its deep learning model.  © 2022 Alwin Poulose et al.

AB  - The management of people with long-term or chronic illness is one of the biggest challenges for national health systems. In fact, these diseases are among the leading causes of hospitalization, especially for the elderly, and huge amount of resources required to monitor them leads to problems with sustainability of the healthcare systems. The increasing diffusion of portable devices and new connectivity technologies allows the implementation of telemonitoring system capable of providing support to health care providers and lighten the burden on hospitals and clinics. In this paper, we present the implementation of a telemonitoring platform for healthcare, designed to capture several types of physiological health parameters from different consumer mobile and custom devices. Consumer medical devices can be integrated into the platform via the Google Fit ecosystem that supports hundreds of devices, while custom devices can directly interact with the platform with standard communication protocols. The platform is designed to process the acquired data using machine learning algorithms, and to provide patients and physicians the physiological health parameters with a user-friendly, comprehensive, and easy to understand dashboard which monitors the parameters through time. Preliminary usabil-ity tests show a good user satisfaction in terms of functionality and usefulness.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Human activity monitoring and recognition is one of the significant focuses for researchers recently due to the concerns regarding improvements of the healthcare, surveillance and many others that includes human-machine interactions. The data collected because of advances in sensor technology and the machine learning algorithms enable the work in the field of recognition of human activities to progress. Life quality of especially elderly people highly benefits from the activity monitoring and recognition research. This study aims to collect data from multiple activities and train multiple machine learning algorithms using the recorded data. For this purpose, a total of two wireless sensors were placed on the ankle and calf regions of the subjects on one leg, and the data obtained from these sensors were used in decision tree, artificial neural network, and deep learning algorithms. The performance of the algorithms was evaluated with the F1 score metric. The results show that the most suitable algorithm for this dataset is the deep learning algorithm with an average F1 score of 0.989. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - The advent of recent pandemics has changed the priority given to the healthcare system by each country, and this has changed the thinking of many towards the management of health-related illnesses. The Internet of Things (IoT) interconnects with smart devices in today’s Internet and has changed the trend in the next-generation technologies. This comes with various advantages like the connectivity of smart devices with several services to amass a huge amount of data and connectivity. These have revolutionized modern healthcare by assuring economic, social, and technological prospects. There has been an increase in the number of elderly people living or staying alone, and the need of monitoring them remotely increasing exponentially. Hence, the use of IoT-based systems can be used to leverage these challenges. The combination of IoT-wearable devices enabled by Artificial Intelligence can be used to solve some of these problems by monitoring elderly persons remotely and allowing them to conduct their day-to-day activities without any fear. Therefore, this paper proposed IoT-wearable enabled AI to remotely monitor elderly persons in real-time. Various wearable sensors were used to capture elderly physiological signs, the IoT-based cloud database was used to store the captured data, and the AI model was to process the data for effective decision-making. The health status of the elderly gets to the healthcare workers in real-time, thus enabling them to give precautionary advice to save lives. The system will also reduce the workload of medical personnel by monitoring elderly persons in real-time and remotely. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The development of flexible electronic skins with high performance and multifunctional sensing capabilities is of great significance for applications ranging from healthcare monitoring to artificial intelligence. To mimic and surpass the high-gauge-factor sensing properties of human skin, structure design and appropriate material selection of sensors are both essentially required. Here, we present an efficient, low-cost fabrication strategy to construct an ultra-highly sensitive, flexible pressure sensor by embedding the aligned nickel-coated carbon fibers (NICFs) in a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate. Our design substantially contributes to ultrahigh sensitivity through the parallel circuit formed by aligned NICFs as well as surface spinosum microstructure molded by sandpaper. As a result, the sensor exhibits excellent sensitivity (15â »525 kPa-1), a fast response time (30 ms), and good stability over 3000 loading-unloading cycles. Furthermore, these superior sensing properties trigger applications in water quality and wave monitoring in conjunction with mechanical flexibility and robustness. As a precedent for adjusting the sensitivities of the sensor, the NICFs/PDMS sensor provides a promising method for multiscenario healthcare monitoring, multiscale pressure spatial distribution, and human-machine interfacing.  ©

AB  - Nowadays, the technological advancements of low power electronic and sensing devices, wearable systems, communication technologies, and cloud computing have encouraged the provision of ubiquitous health monitoring, medical diagnosis, and treatment consultations. The data collected from the patients are transmitted to mHealth server for real-time and self-reliant activity detection, behavior analysis, ambient assisted living, elderly care, activity of daily living, rehabilitations, entertainments, and surveillance in smart home environments. This helps in building sensor analyst systems that analyze the data on mHealth server for disseminating it to the respective end users. This is of utmost importance as it can provide real time feedback to patients, family members, caregivers, and so forth about the behavioral changes of elderly people and people with special needs. In this article, we have proposed knowledge based data dissemination system using machine learning techniques that analyses the data collected on mHealth server in three steps. First, the data are analyzed using support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, neural network, and logistic regression. Second, it finds hidden patterns from the data using hidden Markov model (HMM). Third, it defines fuzzy rules to disseminate the data to the end users. The system has been compared against conventional approaches. The uniqueness of the system lies in the fact that it uses temporal nature of data and provides with real-time feedback as well as predicts outcomes and detects hidden patterns. The results have shown that the techniques NN, HMM, and fuzzy logic when used in conjunction with each other for disease prediction, hidden pattern detection, and data dissemination gives an accuracy of 98%. Thus, increasing effectiveness of sensor analyst system. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Current developments in sensors and actuators are heralding a new era to facilitate things to happen effortlessly and efficiently with proper communication. On the other hand, Internet of Things (IoT) has been boomed up with er potential and occupies a wide range of disciplines. This study has choreographed to design of an algorithm and a smart data-processing scheme to implement the obtained data from the sensing system to transmit to the receivers. Technically, it is called “telediagnosis” and “remote digital monitoring,” a revolution in the field of medicine and artificial intelligence. For the proof of concept, an algorithmic approach has been implemented for telediagnosis with one of the degenerative diseases, that is, Parkinson's disease. Using the data acquired from an improved interdigitated electrode, sensing surface was evaluated with the attained sensitivity of 100 fM (n = 3), and the limit of detection was calculated with the linear regression value coefficient. By the designed algorithm and data processing with the assistance of IoT, further validation was performed and attested the coordination. This proven concept can be ideally used with all sensing strategies for immediate telemedicine by end-to-end communications. © 2021 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

AB  - Parkinson’s disease is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that affects a large portion of the population, especially the elderly. It manifests with motor, cognitive and other types of symptoms, decreasing significantly the patients’ quality of life. The recent advances in the Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence fields, including the subdomains of machine learning and deep learning, can support Parkinson’s disease patients, their caregivers and clinicians at every stage of the disease, maximizing the treatment effectiveness and minimizing the respective healthcare costs at the same time. In this review, the considered studies propose machine learning models, trained on data acquired via smart devices, wearable or non-wearable sensors and other Internet of Things technologies, to provide predictions or estimations regarding Parkinson’s disease aspects. Seven hundred and seventy studies have been retrieved from three dominant academic literature databases. Finally, one hundred and twelve of them have been selected in a systematic way and have been considered in the state-of-the-art systematic review presented in this paper. These studies propose various methods, applied on various sensory data to address different Parkinson’s disease-related problems. The most widely deployed sensors, the most commonly addressed problems and the best performing algorithms are highlighted. Finally, some challenges are summarized along with some future considerations and opportunities that arise. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - While COVID-19 is still ongoing and associated with more than 5 million deaths, the scope and speed of advances over the past year in terms of scientific discovery, data dissemination, and technology have been staggering. It is not a matter of “if” but “when” we will face the next pandemic, and how we leverage technology and data management effectively to create flexible ecosystems that facilitate collaboration, equitable care, and innovation will determine its severity and scale. The aim of this review is to address emerging challenges that came to light during the pandemic in health care and innovations that enabled us to adapt and continue to care for patients. The pandemic highlighted the need for seismic shifts in care paradigms and technology with considerations related to the digital divide and health literacy for digital health interventions to reach full potential and improve health outcomes. We discuss advances in telemedicine, remote patient monitoring, and emerging wearable technologies. Despite the promise of digital health, we emphasise the importance of addressing its limitations, including interpretation challenges, accuracy of findings, and artificial intelligence–driven algorithms. We summarise the most recent recommendation of the Virtual Care Task Force to scaling virtual medical services in Canada. Finally, we propose a model for optimal implementation of health digital innovations with 5 tenets including data management, data security, digital biomarkers, useful artificial intelligence, and clinical integration. © 2021 Canadian Cardiovascular Society

AB  - A continuous heart disease monitoring system is one of the significant applications specified by the Internet of Things (IoT). This goal might be achieved by combining sophisticated expert systems with extensive healthcare data on heart diseases. Several machine learning-based methods have recently been proven for predicting and diagnosing cardiac illness. However, these algorithms are unable to manage high-dimensional information due to the lack of a smart framework that can combine several sources to anticipate cardiac illness. The Fuzzy-Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model is used in this work to present a unique IoT-enabled heart disease prediction method. The benchmark data for the experiment came from public sources and collected via wearable IoT devices. An improved Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) called Population and Fitness-based HHO (PF-HHO) is utilized to select the best features, with the objective function of correlation maximization within the same class and correlation minimization among different classes. The scientific contributions of the health care monitoring system are depicted here that help to improve heart disease healthcare efficiency and also it can be reducing the death rate in the current world. The important section of this persistent healthcare mode is the real-world monitoring system. The simulation outcomes proved that the recommended approach is more successful at predicting heart illness than existing technologies. © 2022 Nalecz Institute of Biocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering of the Polish Academy of Sciences

AB  - Continuous rhythm monitoring using wearable devices is a potential tool for early identification of atrial fibril-lation (AF), the most frequent cardiac arrhythmia (with 0,51% worldwide prevalence, increasing with time), and is also a tool for remote monitoring patients after cardiac surgery. However, AF detection directly through wearable devices is limited by the computational complexity of the classifier model. In this work we propose a lightweight AF classifier model based on the VGG-11 architecture (Lite VGG-11), focusing on reducing the number of parameters and nu-merical operations. Using a low number of filters, depth-wise separable convolution, and global pooling, this model has only 20,454 parameters and needs 6.9 MFLOP to make an inference for an input of 10 seconds of the ECG leads I and II, sampled at 200 Hz. To test its effectiveness for AF detection we used the PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2021 public dataset, stratifying the classes into sinus rhythm, AF, and other rhythms. After 10 Monte Carlo cross-validation splits, with 24,260 unbalanced samples for training and 1,536 balanced samples for validation and testing, the observed met-rics (mean±standard deviation) were: Se 94.1±0.1%; Sp 91.9±0.8%; F1-Score 89.50.7±%; and AUC 96.1±0.6%. © 2022 Creative Commons.

AB  - A soft bending sensor based on the inverse pyramid structure is demonstrated, revealing that it can effectively suppress microcrack formation in designated regions, thus allowing the cracks to open gradually with bending in a controlled manner. Such a feature enabled the bending sensor to simultaneously have a wide dynamic range of bending strain (0.025-5.4%), high gauge factor (∼74), and high linearity (R2∼0.99). Furthermore, the bending sensor can capture repeated instantaneous changes in strain and various types of vibrations, owing to its fast response time. Moreover, the bending direction can be differentiated with a single layer of the sensor, and using an array of sensors integrated on a glove, object recognition was demonstrated via machine learning. Finally, a self-monitoring proprioceptive ionic electroactive polymer (IEAP) actuator capable of operating in liquid was demonstrated. Such features of our bending sensor will enable a simple and effective way of detecting sophisticated motion, thus potentially advancing wearable healthcare monitoring electronics and enabling proprioceptive soft robotics. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Undiagnosed malnutrition is a significant problem in high-income countries, which can reduce the quality of life of many individuals, particularly of older adults. Moreover, it can also inflate the costs of existing health care systems because of the many metabolic complications that it can cause. The current methods for assessing malnutrition can be cumbersome. A trained practitioner must be present to conduct an assessment, or patients must travel to facilities with specialized equipment to obtain their measurements. Therefore, digital health care is a possible way of closing this gap as it is rapidly gaining traction as a scalable means of improving efficiency in the health care system. It allows for the remote monitoring of nutritional status without requiring the physical presence of practitioners or the use of advanced medical equipment. As such, there is an increasing interest in expanding the range of digital applications to facilitate remote monitoring and management of health issues. In this study, we discuss the feasibility of a novel digital remote method for diagnosing malnutrition using facial morphometrics. Many malnutrition screening assessments include subjective assessments of the head and the face. Facial appearance is often used by clinicians as the first point of qualitative indication of health status. Hence, there may be merit in quantifying these subtle but observable changes using facial morphometrics. Modern advancements in artificial intelligence, data science, sensors, and computing technologies allow facial features to be accurately digitized, which could potentially allow these previously intuitive assessments to be quantified. This study aims to stimulate further discussion and discourse on how this emerging technology can be used to provide real-time access to nutritional status. The use of facial morphometrics extends the use of currently available technology and may provide a scalable, easily deployable solution for nutritional status to be monitored in real time. This will enable clinicians and dietitians to keep track of patients remotely and provide the necessary intervention measures as required, as well as providing health care institutions and policy makers with essential information that can be used to inform and enable targeted public health approaches within affected populations. © Wesley Tay, Rina Quek, Bhupinder Kaur, Joseph Lim, Christiani Jeyakumar Henry.

AB  - The hydrogel-based epidermal sensors have attracted tremendous attention due to their versatile potential applications in soft robotics, personal healthcare monitoring, and electronic skins. However, it remains a critical challenge for hydrogel-based sensors to simultaneously achieve self-healing capability and adhesiveness for full-scale human motion biomonitoring. Herein, we proposed a multifunctional MXene/polyampholytes nanocomposite hydrogel. The main network of this hydrogel was formed by the one-step radical polymerization of cationic monomer and anionic monomer. The simultaneous strong and weak ionic bonds-based crosslinking inside this hydrogel endowed it outstanding stretchable, tough, self-healing, adhesive properties, while the introduction of MXene further guaranteed the excellent mechanical properties and conductivity of this hydrogel. Our further exploration of this MXene/polyampholytes in the application as wearable epidermal sensor strongly proved its durable accuracy and sensitivity for the detection of human motions. This epidermal sensor also could be assembled to the detector of the daily activity monitor of Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) patients, which could be utilized to aid the ADHD treatment by remindering the patients to pay attention to their actions. Our work shed a new light on the development of eco-friendly wearable sensor for the personalized healthcare monitoring, human–machine interfaces, and artificial intelligence. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Wearable devices that integrate multiple sensors, processors, and communication technologies have the potential to transform mobile health for remote monitoring of health parameters. However, the small form factor of the wearable devices limits the battery size and operating lifetime. As a result, the devices require frequent recharging, which has limited their widespread adoption. Energy harvesting has emerged as an effective method towards sustainable operation of wearable devices. Unfortunately, energy harvesting alone is not sufficient to fulfill the energy requirements of wearable devices. This paper studies the novel problem of adaptive energy management towards the goal of self-sustainable wearables by using harvested energy to supplement the battery energy and to reduce manual recharging by users. To solve this problem, we propose a principled algorithm referred as AdaEM. There are two key ideas behind AdaEM. First, it uses machine learning (ML) methods to learn predictive models of user activity and energy usage patterns. These models allow us to estimate the potential of energy harvesting in a day as a function of the user activities. Second, it reasons about the uncertainty in predictions and estimations from the ML models to optimize the energy management decisions using a dynamic robust optimization (DyRO) formulation. We propose a light-weight solution for DyRO to meet the practical needs of deployment. We validate the AdaEM approach on a wearable device prototype consisting of solar and motion energy harvesting using real-world data of user activities. Experiments show that AdaEM achieves solutions that are within 5% of the optimal with less than 0.005% execution time and energy overhead.

AB  - High quality and efficient medical service is one of the major factors defining living standards. Developed countries strive to make their healthcare systems as efficient and cost-effective as possible. Remote medical services are a promising approach to lower medical costs and, at the same time, accelerating diagnosis and treatment of diseases. Internet of things (IoT) has the power to connect several devices, users, databases, etc., in a unified manner. Internet of medical things (IoMT) is some type of IoT designed to facilitate medical services. Using IoMT, many of the medical tasks, such as chronic disease monitoring, disease diagnosis, etc., can be realized remotely, leading to lower healthcare costs and better services. This paper is devoted to the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in recent advances on IoMT. Hardware requirements and recent articles proposing solutions for IoMT using AI are reviewed. A comprehensive list of major benefits and challenges is presented as well. Wearable medical devices (WMDs) are also investigated. The WMDs classification is also performed based on their technology. Market share and its anticipated growth for different types of WMDs are also analyzed for the first time. Moreover, common applications of AI in IoMT are reviewed and then classified based on their usage. The paper is closed with the conclusion and possible directions for future works. © 2022

AB  - Background: Although many electrocardiography wearable devices have been released recently for the detection of atrial fibrillation (AF), there are few studies reporting prospective data for wearable devices compared to the strategy of the existing guidelines in the detection of atrial fibrillation (AF) after cryptogenic stroke. A tiny single-patch monitor is more convenient than a conventional Holter monitor recording device and, therefore, longer duration of monitoring may be acceptable. Methods and Design: The CANDLE-AF study is a multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled trial. Patients with transient ischemic attack or ischemic stroke without any history of AF will be enrolled. The superiority of the 72-h single-patch monitor to standard strategy and non-inferiority of the 72-h single-patch monitor to an event-recorder-type device will be investigated. Single-patch monitor arm will repeat monitoring at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, event-recorder-type arm will repeat monitoring twice daily for 12 months. The enrollment goal is a total of 600 patients, and the primary outcome is the detection of AF which continues at least 30 s during study period. The secondary outcome is the rate of changes from antiplatelet to anticoagulant and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events within 1 year. Conclusions: The results of CANDLE-AF will clarify the role of a single-lead patch ECG for the early detection of AF in patients with acute ischemic stroke. In addition, the secondary outcome will be analyzed to determine whether more sensitive AF detection can affect the prognosis and if further device development is meaningful.

AB  - Pulse signal is one of the most important physiological features of human body, which is caused by the cyclical contraction and diastole. It has great research value and broad application prospect in the detection of physiological parameters, the development of medical equipment, and the study of cardiovascular diseases and pulse diagnosis objective. In recent years, with the development of the sensor, measuring and saving of pulse signal has become very convenient. Now the pulse signal feature analysis is a hotspot and difficulty in the signal processing field. Therefore, to realize pulse signal automatic analysis and recognition is vital significance in the aspects of the noninvasive diagnosis and remote monitoring, etc. In this article, we combined the pulse signal feature extraction in time and frequency domain and convolution neural network to analyze the pulse signal. Firstly, a theory of wavelet transform and the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) which is gradually developed in recent years have been used to remove the noises in the pulse signal. Moreover, a method of feature point detection based on differential threshold method is proposed which realized the accurate positioning and extraction time-domain values. Finally, a deep learning method based on one-dimensional CNN has been utilized to make the classification of multiple pulse signals in the article. In conclusion, a deep learning method is proposed for the pulse signal classification combined with the feature extraction in time and frequency domain in this article. Copyright © 2022 Quanyu E.

AB  - Urinalysis is attractive in non-invasive early diagnosis of bladder cancer compared with clinical gold standard cystoscopy. However, the trace bladder tumor biomarkers in urine and the particularly complex urine environment pose significant challenges for urinalysis. Here, a clinically adoptable urinalysis device that integrates molecular-specificity indium gallium zinc oxide field-effect transistor (IGZO FET) biosensor arrays, a device control panel, and an internet terminal for directly analyzing five bladder-tumor-associated proteins in clinical urine samples, is reported for bladder cancer diagnosis and classification. The IGZO FET biosensors with engineered sensing interfaces provide high sensitivity and selectivity for identification of trace proteins in the complex urine environment. Integrating with a machine-learning algorithm, this device can identify bladder cancer with an accuracy of 95.0% in a cohort of 197 patients and 75 non-bladder cancer individuals, distinguishing cancer stages with an overall accuracy of 90.0% and assessing bladder cancer recurrence after surgical treatment. The non-invasive urinalysis device defines a robust technology for remote healthcare and personalized medicine. © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

AB  - Purpose of Review: In this article, we review a range of digital technologies for possible application in heart failure patients, with a focus on lessons learned. We also discuss a future model of heart failure management, as digital technologies continue to become part of standard care. Recent Findings: Digital technologies are increasingly used by healthcare professionals and those living with heart failure to support more personalised and timely shared decision-making, earlier identification of problems, and an improved experience of care. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the acceptability and implementation of a range of digital technologies, including remote monitoring and health tracking, mobile health (wearable technology and smartphone-based applications), and the use of machine learning to augment data interpretation and decision-making. Much has been learned over recent decades on the challenges and opportunities of technology development, including how best to evaluate the impact of digital health interventions on health and healthcare, the human factors involved in implementation and how best to integrate dataflows into the clinical pathway. Summary: Supporting patients with heart failure as well as healthcare professionals (both with a broad range of health and digital literacy skills) is crucial to success. Access to digital technologies and the internet remains a challenge for some patients. The aim should be to identify the right technology for the right patient at the right time, in a process of co-design and co-implementation with patients. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Remote monitoring of a fall condition or activities and daily life (ADL) of elderly patients has become one of the essential purposes for modern telemedicine. Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, including machine and deep learning models, have been recently applied in the medical field to automate the diagnosis procedures of abnormal and diseased cases. They also have many other applications, including the real-time identification of fall accidents in elderly patients. The goal of this article is to review recent research whose focus is to develop AI algorithms and methods of fall detection systems (FDS) in the IoT environment. In addition, the usability of different sensor types, such as gyroscopes and accelerometers in smartwatches, is described and discussed with the current limitations and challenges for realizing successful FDSs. The availability problem of public fall datasets for evaluating the proposed detection algorithms are also addressed in this study. Finally, this article is concluded by proposing advanced techniques such as lightweight deep models as one of the solutions and prospects of futuristic smart IoT-enabled systems for accurate fall detection in the elderly. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The foundation to successful diabetes self-management includes making several healthy behavior decisions daily. The Association of Diabetes Care and Education Specialists 7 (ADCES7) Self-Care behaviors (Association of Diabetes Care and Education Specialists, 2021) highlights healthy coping, healthy eating, being active, monitoring, taking medication, problem solving, and reducing risks. In addition to the Self-Care behaviors, the ADCES7 framework is built upon integrating technologies such as medical devices, wearable technologies, digital health, and telehealth into diabetes care and education. Diabetes healthcare professionals support persons with diabetes (PWD) to make behavior changes with tools such as these technologies. Digital health and telehealth interventions can augment behaviors to support diabetes self-management. Within the healthcare ecosystem, there are four requirements needed to encompass healthy behavior change related to digital health and telehealth tools. First, PWD must be able to access the tool and be adequately trained on the tool. Second, PWD must be able to receive feedback on tool use and data generated by the tool. Third, PWD should receive coaching on behavior change. Fourth, PWD must receive support for ongoing use of the tool. The availability of these tools has rapidly increased since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. This chapter will review the current evidence, barriers, and future directions for digital health and telehealth interventions in the context of behavior change. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This paper employs a unique sensor fusion (SF) approach to detect a COVID-19 suspect and the enhanced MobileNetV2 model is used for face mask detection on an Internet-of-Things (IoT) platform. The SF algorithm avoids incorrect predictions of the suspect. Health data are continuously monitored and recorded on the ThingSpeak cloud server. When a COVID-19 suspect is detected, an emergency email is sent to healthcare personnel with the GPS position of the suspect. A lightweight and fast deep learning model is used to recognize appropriate mask positioning; this restricts virus transmission. When tested with the real-world masked face dataset (RMFD) dataset, the enhanced MobileNetV2 neural network is optimal for Raspberry Pi. Our IoT device and deep learning model are 98.50% (compared to commercial devices) and 99.26% accurate, respectively, and the time required for face mask evaluation is 31.1 milliseconds. The proposed device is useful for remote monitoring of covid patients. Thus, the method will find medical application in the detection of COVID-19-positive patients. The device is also wearable. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Pulse signal is one of the most important physiological features of human body, which is caused by the cyclical contraction and diastole. It has great research value and broad application prospect in the detection of physiological parameters, the development of medical equipment, and the study of cardiovascular diseases and pulse diagnosis objective. In recent years, with the development of the sensor, measuring and saving of pulse signal has become very convenient. Now the pulse signal feature analysis is a hotspot and difficulty in the signal processing field. Therefore, to realize pulse signal automatic analysis and recognition is vital significance in the aspects of the noninvasive diagnosis and remote monitoring, etc. In this article, we combined the pulse signal feature extraction in time and frequency domain and convolution neural network to analyze the pulse signal. Firstly, a theory of wavelet transform and the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) which is gradually developed in recent years have been used to remove the noises in the pulse signal. Moreover, a method of feature point detection based on differential threshold method is proposed which realized the accurate positioning and extraction time-domain values. Finally, a deep learning method based on one-dimensional CNN has been utilized to make the classification of multiple pulse signals in the article. In conclusion, a deep learning method is proposed for the pulse signal classification combined with the feature extraction in time and frequency domain in this article.  © 2022 Quanyu E.

AB  - Background: Abnormal prolongation or shortening of the QT interval is associated with increased risk for ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. For continuous monitoring, widespread use, and prevention of cardiac events, advanced wearable technologies are emerging as promising surrogates for conventional 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) QT interval assessment. Previous studies have shown a good agreement between QT and corrected QT (QTc) intervals measured on a smartwatch ECG and a 12-lead ECG, but the clinical accuracy of computerized algorithms for QT and QTc interval measurement from smartwatch ECGs is unclear. Objective: The prospective observational study compared the smartwatch-recorded QT and QTc assessed using AccurKardia’s AccurBeat platform with the conventional 12-lead ECG annotated manually by a cardiologist. Methods: ECGs were collected from healthy participants (without any known cardiovascular disease) aged >22 years. Two consecutive 30-second ECG readings followed by (within 15 minutes) a 10-second standard 12-lead ECG were recorded for each participant. Characteristics of the participants were compared by sex using a 2-sample t test and Wilcoxon rank sum test. Statistical comparisons of heart rate (HR), QT interval, and QTc interval between the platform and the 12-lead ECG, ECG lead I, and ECG lead II were done using the Wilcoxon sign rank test. Linear regression was used to predict QTc and QT intervals from the ECG based on the platform’s QTc/QT intervals with adjustment for age, sex, and difference in HR measurement. The Bland-Altman method was used to check agreement between various QT and QTc interval measurements. Results: A total of 50 participants (32 female, mean age 46 years, SD 1 year) were included in the study. The result of the regression model using the platform measurements to predict the 12-lead ECG measurements indicated that, in univariate analysis, QT/QTc intervals from the platform significantly predicted QT/QTc intervals from the 12-lead ECG, ECG lead I, and ECG lead II, and this remained significant after adjustment for sex, age, and change in HR. The Bland-Altman plot results found that 96% of the average QTc interval measurements between the platform and QTc intervals from the 12-lead ECG were within the 95% confidence limit of the average difference between the two measurements, with a mean difference of –10.5 (95% limits of agreement –71.43, 50.43). A total of 94% of the average QT interval measurements between the platform and the 12-lead ECG were within the 95% CI of the average difference between the two measurements, with a mean difference of –6.3 (95% limits of agreement –54.54, 41.94). Conclusions: QT and QTc intervals obtained by a smartwatch coupled with the platform’s assessment were comparable to those from a 12-lead ECG. Accordingly, with further refinements, remote monitoring using this technology holds promise for the identification of QT interval prolongation. ©Sara Chokshi, Gulzhan Tologonova, Rose Calixte, Vandana Yadav, Naveed Razvi, Jason Lazar, Stan Kachnowski.

AB  - One of the major technologies, which support healthcare industry and its applications in the current scenario, is the Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT plays a vital role in the field of health services by interconnecting various resources involved in the medical field and provides more secure, smart and effective services to the general community. Many advanced sensors are available right now in the market that can be wearable or can be implanted into the human body and the purpose of which is to observe the health of the patients continuously, collect their data and transfer the patient's health-related data to the medical server. Machine learning along with IoT is being extensively used in the field of health sector and medical diagnosis. With the improvement in the technology, we could predict the diseases forehand and can able to predict the seriousness of the problem. The IoT framework is used for collecting the heartbeat, blood pressure, and temperature of a person via the sensor deployed in the human body and using machine learning algorithm to predict the heart disease of a particular person and also to analyze the current health condition of a particular person. Cleveland heart diseases data set is being used here for predicting the heart disease and the collected patient information is used for finding out the prediction of diseases. Comparison of four machine learning algorithms, namely Naïve Bayes Algorithm, Decision Trees, KNN and logistic regression, is carried out. Proposed method combines both IoT and machine learning concepts and is used to provide efficient and effective remote health monitoring for patient, determine whether a patient is having a particular disease or not as well as to provide a quick solution to the patients in case of some emergency situation, which requires immediate doctor attention. The proposed method is very effective and helps in predicting the heart diseases at a very early stage. © 2022 Scrivener Publishing LLC.

AB  - Novel means to minimize treatment delays in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) are needed. Using an accelerometer and gyroscope on the chest yield mechanocardiographic (MCG) data. We investigated whether STEMI causes changes in MCG signals which could help to detect STEMI. The study group consisted of 41 STEMI patients and 49 control patients referred for elective coronary angiography and having normal left ventricular function and no valvular heart disease or arrhythmia. MCG signals were recorded on the upper sternum in supine position upon arrival to the catheterization laboratory. In this study, we used a dedicated wearable sensor equipped with 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis gyroscope and 1-lead ECG in order to facilitate the detection of STEMI in a clinically meaningful way. A supervised machine learning approach was used. Stability of beat morphology, signal strength, maximum amplitude and its timing were calculated in six axes from each window with varying band-pass filters in 2–90 Hz range. In total, 613 features were investigated. Using logistic regression classifier and leave-one-person-out cross validation we obtained a sensitivity of 73.9%, specificity of 85.7% and AUC of 0.857 (SD = 0.005) using 150 best features. As a result, mechanical signals recorded on the upper chest wall with the accelerometers and gyroscopes differ significantly between STEMI patients and stable patients with normal left ventricular function. Future research will show whether MCG can be used for the early screening of STEMI. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) systems are valid solutions for remote health monitoring. The combination of technology and network with medical knowledge leads to important telemedicine solutions. Telemedicine is the practice of medical care where patient and providers are separated by distance. Telemonitoring of chronic diseases is one of the most important aspects of telemedicine. Chronic diseases such as chronic venous disease and diabetic foot require continuous monitoring in order to prevent complications, which can become very burdensome, with variations in plantar pressures, deformations, ulcers, up to amputations. The quality of life of those suffering from these diseases is strongly affected and furthermore the continuous monitoring causes great expenses for the health system. We propose an IoT infrastructure for the screening and recognition of patients suffering from phlebopathic disease, based on the use of a smart sock. The smart sock integrates pressure sensors and inertial sensors, worn by patients during a dynamic test. The main contribution of this work is the development of machine learning models on the collected and processed data of a sample population of 24 participants, 13 healthy and 11 suffering from phlebopathic diseases. The best classifier obtained shows very good performance, with an accuracy of 95.83%, high precision, recall and a F1-Score equal to 0.95, making the proposed framework a good candidate as system for screening phlebopathic patients and for their early diagnosis. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - The remote healthcare monitoring framework is the fusion of hardware units using wearable sensor nodes, cloud storage, and mobile communication. In the countries like India, the availability of medical facilities is not uniform across all places. There is a need for increasing the effectiveness of the medical system, thus accelerating the medical services. Internet of Things (IoT)-assisted healthcare system helps in the diagnosis of disease at an early stage and saves the patients from critical events. The knowledge of understanding the vital parameters of any individual and taking adequate care of health is becoming essential. Connecting people with expertise in the field of medicine with the acquaintance of electronic gadgets is the primary objective of the proposed paper. The proposed framework demonstrated that the aids of I-connect (Internet of Things) with machine learning model increased the efficiency of the medical sector. Monitoring of vital parameters of patients remotely by the specialists will help to seek advice and alert the patient with notification. Outcomes of the proposed IoT-enabled health care prove better returns compared to the traditional healthcare system in place. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Understanding the performance of medical devices in all individuals triggered the FDA to launch the CRDH Health of Women Program earlier this year [1]. There is a danger that machine learning and AI could perpetuate the problem of suboptimal performance in women in healthcare as it has in other industries [2]. Women who present with symptoms consistent with an Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) or stroke are often under-diagnosed and under-represented in clinical trials. Moreover, there are data to suggest that women with cardiovascular disease have worse outcomes, poorer prognoses, and higher mortality rates than men. Optimizing the performance of medical devices in women’s bodies has been an unmet need identified in the last 30 years of studies in the field of sex-differences in cardiology. Determining the risk of future adverse cardiovascular events, as well as early detection and improving treatment and procedures for women who have previously suffered an ACS is therefore a problem of paramount importance in the field of cardiovascular medicine. Remote patient monitoring offers unique opportunities for both female patients and clinicians to improve patient outcomes and deal with information gaps on female cardiac health. We have developed an augmented garment (AG) wireless monitor that records vital-sign information through textile sensors and can be integrated in a form factor such as a bra to enable long-term wear. It has the capability to record electrocardiographic (ECG) data that can be monitored in real-time via Bluetooth as it saves long-term continuous information and uploads to a secure server without the need to manually download the acquired data or connect the AG via wires. We aim to contribute to women's health research by generating sex-specific tools in the growing field of machine learning in healthcare. Copyright retained by Authors.

AB  - Over the past few decades, technology and improvements in artificial intelligence have dramatically changed major sectors of our day-to-day lives, including the field of healthcare. E-health includes a wide range of subdomains, such as wearables, smart-inhalers, portable electronic spirometers, digital stethoscopes, and clinical decision support systems. E-health has been consistently shown to enhance the quality of care, improve adherence to therapy, and allow early detection of worsening in chronic pulmonary diseases. The present review addresses the current and potential future role of major e-health tools and approaches in respiratory medicine, with the aim of providing readers with trustful and updated evidence to increase their awareness of the topic, and to allow them to optimally benefit from the latest innovation technology. Collected literature evidence shows that the potential of technology tools in respiratory medicine mainly relies on three fundamental interactions: between clinicians, between clinician and patient, and between patient and health technology. However, it would be desirable to establish widely agreed and adopted standards for conducting trials and reporting results in this area, as well as to take into proper consideration potentially relevant pitfalls related to privacy protection and compliance with regulatory procedures. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: The cost of heart failure hospitalizations in the US alone is over USD 10 billion per year. Over 4 million Americans are hospitalized every year due to heart failure (HF), with a median length of stay of 4 days and an in-hospital mortality rate that exceeds 5%. Hospitalizations of patients with HF can be prevented by early detection of lung congestion. Our study assessed a new contact-free optical medical device used for the early detection of lung congestion. Methods: The Gili system is an FDA-cleared device used for measuring chest motion vibration data. Lung congestion in the study was assessed clinically and verified via two cardiologists. An algorithm was developed using machine learning techniques, and cross-validation of the findings was performed to estimate the accuracy of the algorithm. Results: A total of 227 patients were recruited (101 cases vs. 126 controls). The sensitivity and specificity for the device in our study were 0.91 (95% CI: 0.86–0.93) and 0.91 (95% CI: 0.87–0.94), respectively. In all instances, the observed estimates of PPVs and NPVs were at least 0.82 and 0.90, respectively. The accuracy of the algorithm was not affected by different covariates (including respiratory or valvular conditions). Conclusions: This study demonstrates the efficacy of a contact-free optical device for detecting lung congestion. Further validation of the study results across a larger and precise scale is warranted. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Digitalization of healthcare led to the optimization of monitoring, diagnostics, and treatment of the range of disorders. Taking into account recent situation with COVID-19 pandemics, digital technologies allowed to improve management of viral infections via remote monitoring and diagnostics of infected patients. Up to date, various mobile health applications (apps) have been proposed, including apps for the patients diagnosed with cardiovascular pathologies. Objective: The presented review aimed at the analyses of a range of mHealth solutions used to improve primary cardiac care. In addition, we studied the factors driving and hindering the wide introduction of mHealth services in the clinics. Methods: The work was based on the guidelines of the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. The publication search was carried out using PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases. Studies published during the period from 2014 until January 2022 were selected for the analysis. The evaluation of risk of bias for the included studies was conducted using the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias tool. Results and Discussion: An overall 5513 studies were assessed for eligibility after which 39 studies were included. The main trend in the mobile health for cardiological applications is the use of different types of wearable devices and Artificial Intelligence-platforms. In fact, mobile technology allows remotely to monitor, interpret, and analyze biomedical data collected from the patient. Conclusion: The results of this literature search demonstrated that patients diagnosed with cardiovascular disorders can potentially benefit from the application of mHealth in cardiology. However, despite the proven advantages of mHealth for cardiology, there are many challenges and concerns regarding effectiveness, safety, reliability and the lack of official regulation and guidelines from official organizations. Such issues require solutions and further work towards a wide implementation of mHealth technologies in cardiac practice.  © 2022 Shynar Kulbayeva.

AB  - Most commercial cadence-measurement systems in road cycling are strictly limited in their function to the measurement of cadence. Other relevant signals, such as roll angle, inclination or a round kick evaluation, cannot be measured with them. This work proposes an alternative cadence-measurement system with less of the mentioned restrictions, without the need for distinct cadence-measurement apparatus attached to the pedal and shaft of the road bicycle. The proposed design applies an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to the seating pole of the bike. In an experiment, the motion data were gathered. A total of four different road cyclists participated in this study to collect different datasets for neural network training and evaluation. In total, over 10 h of road cycling data were recorded and used to train the neural network. The network’s aim was to detect each revolution of the crank within the data. The evaluation of the data has shown that using pure accelerometer data from all three axes led to the best result in combination with the proposed network architecture. A working proof of concept was achieved with an accuracy of approximately 95% on test data. As the proof of concept can also be seen as a new method for measuring cadence, the method was compared with the ground truth. Comparing the ground truth and the predicted cadence, it can be stated that for the relevant range of 50 rpm and above, the prediction over-predicts the cadence with approximately 0.9 rpm with a standard deviation of 2.05 rpm. The results indicate that the proposed design is fully functioning and can be seen as an alternative method to detect the cadence of a road cyclist. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Due to the breadth of its application domains, Hu-man Activity Recognition (HAR) is a problematic area of human-computer interaction. HAR can be used in remote monitoring of senior healthcare and concern situations in intelligent man-ufacturing, among other applications. HAR based on wearable inertial sensors has been researched identification efficiency in various kinds of human actions considerably more than vision-based HAR. The sensor-based HAR is generally applicable to indoor and outdoor locations without privacy considerations of implementation. In this research, we explore the recognition performance of multiple deep learning (DL) models to recognize everyday living human activities. We developed a deep residual neural network that employed aggregated multi-branch transformation to boost identification performance. The proposed model is called the ResNeXt model. To evaluate its performance, three standard DL models (CNN, LSTM, and CNN-LSTM) are investigated and compared to our proposed model using a standard HAR dataset called Daily Living Activity dataset. These datasets gathered mobility signal data from multimodal sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer) in three distinct body areas (wrist, hip, and ankle). The experimental findings reveal that the proposed model surpasses other benchmark DL models with maximum accuracy and F1-scores. Furthermore, the findings show that the ResNeXt model is more resistant than other models with fewer training parameters.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Continuously monitoring and tracking of patient health data can be a daunting task in a hospital. However, some people require regular monitoring due to physiological needs in order to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Especially for the elderly and those who have been in a coma for a long time, it is critical to regularly measure and inform their loved ones' wellness at work. This research work proposed an innovative LoRa-loT-based intelligent healthcare system using Artificial intelligence. All patients' healthcare data can be transmitted to Cloud through the LoRA transceiver. Also, the bed up/down can be controlled through Online Voice Command using Artificial Intelligence. An intelligent hospital health remote control system has been proposed to monitor patients' health at a hospital and acquire a doctor's prescription. Doctors can also identify patients' illnesses using data collected remotely from them. Android-based mobile applications are utilized as an interface for web-based applications to execute effective real-time communication involving doctors and patients using LoRA-IoT. This approach uses five sensors to collect data from the hospital environment: a heart rate sensor, a body temperature sensor, a room-temperature sensor, a CO sensor, and a max30100 sensor. Incorporating specific functions in mobile intelligent hospital automation equipment enables remote monitoring at the hospital and makes life more comfortable. As a result, patients who have caused self-isolation or self-isolation can use one of the most significant variables, the mobile phone, to convey their daily health symptoms and difficulties to their doctor. As a result, it will be able to enhance patient health and live a more pleasant life.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Chronic fluid overload is associated with morbidity and mortality in hemodialysis patients. Optimizing the diagnosis and treatment of fluid overload remains a priority for the nephrology community. Although current methods of assessing fluid status, such as bioimpedance and lung ultrasound, have prognostic and diagnostic value, no single system or technique can be used to maintain euvolemia. The difficulty in maintaining and assessing fluid status led to a publication by the Kidney Health Initiative in 2019 aimed at fostering innovation in fluid management therapies. This review article focuses on the current limitations in our assessment of extracellular volume, and the novel technology and methods that can create a new paradigm for fluid management. The cardiology community has published research on multiparametric wearable devices that can create individualized predictions for heart failure events. In the future, similar wearable technology may be capable of tracking fluid changes during the interdialytic period and enabling behavioral change. Machine learning methods have shown promise in the prediction of volume-related adverse events. Similar methods can be leveraged to create accurate, automated predictions of dry weight that can potentially be used to guide ultrafiltration targets and interdialytic weight gain goals. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Real-time effective ECG data collecting, transmitting, and monitoring system with feature extraction is a big challenge in biomedical signal processing. The electrocardiogram is a widely used testing system to measure and analyse coronary heart diseases, i.e., cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Heart rate remote monitoring under the service provided by hospital equipment is the technology that currently needs to improve. IoT enabled medical device helps to achieve this efficiently. To design such systems energy-efficient communication protocol, data-transfer minimisation, assurance of delivery (security), heterogeneous natures of the environment are necessary considerations. This paper outlines a literature survey of three main important areas; ‘real-time ECG monitoring using wearable sensors’, ‘feature extraction and classification method for real-time ECG monitoring’, and ‘secured IoT protocol for real-time ECG monitoring’.

AB  - The COVID-19 has changed the scenario of patient care in most of the hospitals and healthcare centers throughout the world. Since pandemic is spread through contact with the COVID infected person, the most vulnerable community is doctors and healthcare workers. To avoid the mixing of COVID patients from other diseases, there is a need to be a separation, which will contain the spread of virus. As such, remote patient monitoring becomes very essential to take care of the patients under such situations. Because of this medical data is growing exponentially and needs to be analyzed continuously to improve the health care. Data analytics improved the performance of health care organization by proper decision making, accurate and timely information. Medical data can be explored from the sensors or medical equipments installed in the hospitals or can be collected from the fast-growing Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Visualizing the data and correlating the same with the patient monitoring for better treatment and health care is an essential part of it. This paper discusses various Machine Learning (ML) approaches for remote patient monitoring using medical IoT data for the Post-COVID patient care. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Most people are unable to identify their actual illness, and many patients die before they are hospitalized. Therefore, in this research, a health monitoring system (HMS) is proposed and it suggests diseases such as arrhythmia, diabetes, fever, etc. and diagnoses chronic diseases in the ambulance itself and provides real-time prediction for critical and normal patients. The proposed system has a multi-tiered structure where physiological features are captured by wearable medical sensors (WMS) and machine learning suites are used to analyze data and to detect chronic diseases. Results obtained on the real datasets puts forward that sensor data and machine learning can effectively predict chronic diseases in real time. HMS can predict accuracies of various conditions such as arrhythmia (98.89%). Diabetes (96.74%), hypertension (98.85%), fever (99.85%) and thyroid (97.4%). In conclusion, we can say that the proposed HMS can assist us to monitor the affected person's physical condition at his/her residence, or at the ambulance within the golden hour of a patient's life.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - The goal of wearable patches in the healthcare system is to eliminate the conventional health care system. It is achieved by detecting data received from sensor nodes using IoT technology and processing it using a strategy for remote patient monitoring based on machine learning. This is as the data transmission is carried out by a sensor in the network, which utilises the power backup of the nodes. Even successful ways of data collection from several nodes in smart wearable patches and data aggregation may reduce the network’s power supply. Therefore, the heuristic algorithm opportunistic power optimum performance algorithm (OP2A) is employed to increase the sensor nodes’ lifetime in the healthcare system. This eliminates unnecessary data loops between network patches, and the algorithm’s effectiveness is measured in terms of network lifetime, latency in sensing data, throughput, and error metrics. In addition, the gateway manages the service and communicates with the data server using the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP). Using self-trained models, the suggested machine learning approach predicts the health state. This gets rid of any unnecessary data loops between the network’s wearable patches, and the algorithm’s effectiveness is measured by the network’s lifespan, how long it takes to sense data, how much data it can handle, and how many errors it makes. © 2022, Scibulcom Ltd..

AB  - Machine Learning (ML) and especially Deep Learning (DL) models have been already proven successful in automated or assisted decision-making support in multiple domains. This is particularly evident in the data-intensive domains, such as the clinical practice. In this paper, we provide a systematic view of using ML/DL approaches in orthopedic rehabilitation (predicting success, wearable sensors), remote monitoring and rehabilitation follow-up (including the assessment). Furthermore, in the effort to provide sensible and complete guidelines for using the ML/DL in the field in the future, we identify the characteristic features of data (used for training and testing algorithms) and algorithms themselves. Finally, we identify data privacy, data integration and liability as the current challenges for increasing the pace of implementing the use of ML/DL methods in remote monitoring and assistance in orthopedic rehabilitation. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.

AB  - The outbreak of the corona virus pandemic has severely disrupted human lives and socioeconomical structures across most nations around the world since December 2019. Researchers around the world are working on finding solutions to overcome or at least control the pandemic. Biometric monitoring and artificial intelligence (AI) offer on-spot sample management for monitoring patients as advanced applications of modern technologies. Various telehealth and remote monitoring systems have become prevalent for early detection of symptoms by collecting dynamic data from patients through biometric monitoring technologies (BMTs). In this chapter, we have summarized rapid diagnostic kits that are available in the market recently. Furthermore, the principle of BMTs and its applications have been discussed in this chapter. In addition, the benefits and challenges involved in using these advanced technologies have also been summarized. Further, advantages of AI technologies that are used in proper screening, analysis, tracking, and prediction have been discussed. We also provided a detailed insight on systematic sample handling processes using the above-mentioned technologies. The advantages of remote data collection and future outlooks of biosensors to be employed remotely for COVID-19 detection and diagnosis have also been explored. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Introduction Current international guidelines recommend ECG monitoring after an ischaemic stroke to detect atrial fibrillation (AF) in order to prevent stroke recurrence. However, optimal strategies to detect AF and the downstream management to prevent stroke recurrence remain to be established. The objective of the study was to explore the use of long-term home-based ECG monitoring for AF detection and stroke prevention in patients with a history of stroke. Methods and analysis This prospective, randomised, open-label trial with blinded endpoint adjudication aimed to evaluate the efficacy of long-term home-based ECG monitoring for AF detection and stroke prevention in a 24-month period. Patients aged >18 years with a history of ischaemic stroke will be stratified according to the time from the index ischaemic stroke: <1, 1-3 and >3 years and then randomised in 1:1 to (1) home-based AF screening and (2) control. The home-based AF screening system comprises (1) a handheld single-lead ECG recorder (Comfit Healthcare Devices, Hong Kong SAR, China) and (2) a patient-facing smartphone application specially designed for the study. Patients randomised to the home-based AF group will record a 30 s single-lead ECG using a specially designed handheld ECG device every morning or when symptomatic. All remotely obtained data will be automatically transmitted in real-time through the study smartphone application to a secured cloud hosting and analysed using an artificial intelligence-based diagnostic system. When a diagnosis of AF is made with the system, the patients will be called back for a formal cardiology consultation within 1 week. The primary endpoint is the time to first detection of AF at 24 months of follow-up. Secondary endpoints include recurrent stroke or transient ischaemic attack, initiation of long-term anticoagulation therapy, hospitalisation for heart failure, cardiovascular death and all-cause death. Ethics and dissemination The study protocol has been approved by the institutional review board of The University of Hong Kong, and Hong Kong West Cluster, Hospital Authority, Hong Kong SAR, China. Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals. Trial registration number NCT04523649. ©

AB  - The Objective of the proposed work is to apply an Internet of Things-based real-Time remote patient monitoring system. Healthcare technology is one of the most popular studies in recent years. people's lifespans have successfully extended with the development of healthcare facilities and technologies. However, people in rural areas still have difficulty in obtaining healthcare services due to the barrier of distance and lack of doctors. The present work provides one of the best solutions to overcome this issue. During the pandemic situation, mortality was observed due to a lack of doctors and infrastructure as the patient-To-doctor ratio was more. The proposed experiment helps to overcome these problems. The data collected from various sensors are sent to the cloud and prediction along with a diagnosis of the patient are implemented. Algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Extreme Gradient Boosting are being compared to obtain maximum accuracy. The Random Forest model is providing good accuracy for the prediction of a patient's condition compared to other algorithms.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Compressed Machine (ML) and Deep Learning(DL) techniques are the emerging areas in research, the use of compressed ML and DL algorithms is recommended on System on Chip(SoC) platforms as the latencies of ML or DL algorithms will be extremely high. This paper explores the need to use compressed ML/DL techniques by analyzing the various popular ML algorithms by implementing them on different platforms including SoCs, in particular Snapdragon 410c which will be used on the wearable biomedical device. This paper looks at fall prediction using wearables. The wearable device uses 410c as the platform and data is collected using IMU and heart rate sensors. A data set was created by collecting IMU and heart rate sensor values across different fall and non fall Activities of Daily Living(ADL) activities, over 70k data points was collected of which 70 percent was used to train the algorithm and 30 percent was used as test data. The same data set was used across varying algorithms and platforms and the performance as well as the latencies were analyzed.It was found that the latencies was found to be greater than 120 sec for even K Nearest Neighbours(KNN) when run on SoCs. This clearly indicates that we cannot use classical ML algorithms. When a public dataset SmartFall which had 92,780 data points was used, Support Vector Machine(SVM) algorithm did not converge even after several hours of computing. In case of Random Forest it took 2235 seconds for the algorithm to converge. As the size of the dataset increased obviously there was an increase in latency with complex ML algorithms are unable to converge, hence this research indicates the necessity of compressed ML algorithms. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) has firmly established itself as a popular technology. It strives to make it easier for people across domains to live an 'Easy & Smart' lifestyle. Machine vision and artificial intelligence (AI) are the sources of the idea of image recognition. Chronic illnesses, a catch-all phrase for conditions including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, other types of dementia, cardiovascular disorders, and more, are on the rise. They come with challenges relating to ongoing supervision, care, and aid. Not everyone is prepared to handle the financial and ethical issues involving patients and their caretakers. Wearable IoT devices and AI offer a potential quick aid for dependable remote monitoring and help through ambient medical aid without jeopardizing the patient's confidentiality or privacy. The proposed work seeks to design a prototype that is inexpensive and provides pleasant patient healthcare. Concerning Alzheimer's, applications and IoT and AI devices are used to create a long-term fix. The patient will be able to recognize familiar people around them and capture knowledge for future reminders with the use of the proposed wearable camera-aided device in conjunction with a Bluetooth ear-complementary device. The AI component triggers constant reminders, which helps the patient stay more aware of their surroundings & situation.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Objective: Ambulatory monitoring of ground reaction force (GRF) and center of pressure (CoP) could improve management of health conditions that impair mobility. Insoles instrumented with force-sensitive resistors (FSRs) are an unobtrusive, low-cost, and low-power technology for sampling GRF and CoP in real-world environments. However, FSRs have variable response characteristics that complicate estimation of GRF and CoP. This study introduces a unique data analytic pipeline that enables accurate estimation of GRF and CoP despite relatively inaccurate FSR responses. This paper also investigates whether inclusion of a complementary knee angle sensor improves estimation accuracy. Methods: Seventeen healthy subjects were equipped with an insole instrumented with six FSRs and a string-based knee angle sensor. Subjects walked in a straight line at self-selected slow, preferred, and fast speeds over an in-ground force platform. Twenty repetitions were performed for each speed. Supervised machine learning models estimated weight-normalized GRF and shoe size-normalized CoP, which were re-scaled to obtain GRF and CoP. Results: Anteroposterior GRF, Vertical GRF, and Anteroposterior CoP were estimated with a normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of less than 5%. Mediolateral GRF and CoP were estimated with an NRMSE of 8.1% and 6.4%, respectively. Knee angle-related features slightly improved GRF estimates. Conclusion: Normalized models accurately estimated GRF and CoP despite deficiencies in FSR data. Significance: Ambulatory use of the proposed system could enable objective, longitudinal monitoring of severity and progression for a variety of health conditions.  © 1964-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Healthcare is a field that is developing with the exponential increase in technology and services. Disruptive technology has opened up great possibilities in remote patient monitoring. Artificial intelligence-based remote patient monitoring adopting wearable technology and a variety of health monitoring gadgets play a significant role in digitally connecting patients from home to healthcare experts. The versatility and the utilization of the latest technologies enable "patient monitoring, healthcare information technology, intelligent assistance diagnosis, and information analysis collaboration treatment" by identifying at risk patients. Patient access to health records and resources via web and mobile backed with cloud-based data collection, monitoring, and analytics capabilities reduce recurrent hospital visits and raise alert messages in case of any abnormalities. Machine learning algorithms search through an enormous amount of health-related data, analyze it, and predict outcomes for individual patients using unique client identifier and support clinical decision making. The importance of security and privacy challenge-related issues is the main concern in the transfer medical and the logging of data transactions; to overcome this issue, we propose a block diagram that protects and denies illegal access. Several sick people suffer because of a lack of not getting proper assistance and apt solution on time for their problem. The proposed system recommends an instantaneous solution and provides proper assistance during an emergency, by predicting its seriousness using modern algorithms. Using various "supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms" the data set is trained and analyzed to predict the disease for a particular patient or the patient's health. The data stored in the database are tested by the k-nearest neighbor classifier and linear regression. The accurate classification is made by the classifier which hardly needs manual rechecking. Hence, the system proposed by the authors has scalability that deals with the online prediction and facilitates patient care remotely. © 2022 Scrivener Publishing LLC.

AB  - Wearable technology is an emerging method for the early detection of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. This scoping review explored the types, mechanisms, and accuracy of wearable technology for the early detection of COVID-19. This review was conducted according to the five-step framework of Arksey and O'Malley. Studies published between December 31, 2019 and December 15, 2021 were obtained from 10 electronic databases, namely, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ProQuest, Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and Taylor & Francis Online. Grey literature, reference lists, and key journals were also searched. All types of articles describing wearable technology for the detection of COVID-19 infection were included. Two reviewers independently screened the articles against the eligibility criteria and extracted the data using a data charting form. A total of 40 articles were included in this review. There are 22 different types of wearable technology used to detect COVID-19 infections early in the existing literature and are categorized as smartwatches or fitness trackers (67%), medical devices (27%), or others (6%). Based on deviations in physiological characteristics, anomaly detection models that can detect COVID-19 infection early were built using artificial intelligence or statistical analysis techniques. Reported area-under-the-curve values ranged from 75% to 94.4%, and sensitivity and specificity values ranged from 36.5% to 100% and 73% to 95.3%, respectively. Further research is necessary to validate the effectiveness and clinical dependability of wearable technology before healthcare policymakers can mandate its use for remote surveillance. © 2022

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven adaptive techniques are viable to optimize the resources in the Internet of Things (IoT) enabled wearable healthcare devices. Due to the miniature size and ability of wireless data transfer, Body Sensor Networks (BSNs) have become the center of attention in current medical media technologies. For a long-term and reliable healthcare system, high energy efficiency, transmission reliability, and longer battery lifetime of wearable sensors devices are required. There is a dire need for empowering sensor-based wearable techniques in BSNs from every aspect i.e., data collection, healthcare monitoring, and diagnosis. The consideration of protocol layers, data routing, and energy optimization strategies improves the efficiency of healthcare delivery. Hence, this work presents some key contributions. Firstly, it proposes a novel avant-garde framework to simultaneously optimize the energy efficiency, battery lifetime, and reliability for smart and connected healthcare. Secondly, in this study, an Adaptive Transmission Data Rate (ATDR) mechanism is proposed, which works on the average constant energy consumption by varying the active time of the sensor node to optimize the energy over the dynamic wireless channel. Moreover, a Self-Adaptive Routing Algorithm (SARA) is developed to adopt a dynamic source routing mechanism with an energy-efficient and shortest possible path, unlike the conventional routing methods. Lastly, real-time datasets are adopted for intensive experimental setup for revealing pervasive and cost-effective healthcare through wearable devices. It is observed and analysed that proposed algorithms outperform in terms of high energy efficiency, better reliability, and longer battery lifetime of portable devices.  © 2022 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.

AB  - Rapid development in the production of wearable devices has taken place for healthcare monitoring system. At the same time, the existence of imbalanced data poses a major influence on the prediction model, and many of the under sampling models require maximum time and decreased performance. In this view, this chapter develops a new class imbalance data handling (CIH) with optimal deep belief network (ODBN) model, named CIH-ODBN for ubiquitous healthcare monitoring system. To handle the class imbalance problem in healthcare data, adaptive synthetic sampling (ADASYN) technique is employed. Besides, the ODBN model is applied to determine the presence of diseases. In addition, rainfall optimization algorithm (ROA) is introduced to tune the hyperparameters of the deep belief network (DBN) model. An extensive implementation analysis was performed to signify the effectual outcome of the CIH-ODBN model. The outcome for the experimental validation verified the effective classification outcome of the CIH-ODBN model with the accuracy of 0.916 and 0.932 on the test diabetes and heart disease dataset. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The health care system is overwhelming with COVID-19 patients since the end of 2019. Many countries have postponed their public screening programs and are fighting to maintain balance between essential health care and COVID-19 pandemic. At this point of time, IoT along with artificial intelligence (AI) provides a solution for a remote IoT based healthcare system. IoT based wearable devices collect data and send them to the cloud via IoT Gateway. Further, the data are analyzed by AI to raise alerts at times of emergencies like a sudden drop-in pulse rate etc. AI needs a large database for training and processing. This threatens the patient’s data security and privacy. To overcome this threat, an encryption algorithm can be used. When it comes to remote healthcare, monitoring of cardio vascular muscles is the most important of all. This can be done by an electrocardiogram (ECG). These ECG signals are transmitted in case of emergency and are stored in remote servers. The ECG signals are unique in nature and they can be used in biometric devices which attract hackers. To avoid the intruders, the data is encrypted and transmitted. In this paper, we provide a lightweight cellular automaton (CA) based encryption algorithm to suit limited power and low memory devices. For ECG based evaluation, the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database is considered. © 2021 Totem Publisher, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - More adaptable and user-independent techniques are required for multi-sensors based daily locomotion detection (MS-DLD). This research study proposes a couple of locomotion detection methods using body-worn multi-sensors to successfully categorize several locomotion transitions. This research presents both standard and state-of-the-art methods for MS-DLD. Conventionally, to improve MS-DLD process, the proposed methodology consists of a wavelet transformed Quaternion-based filter for the inertial signals, patterns recognition in the form of kinematic-static energies, and state-of-the-art multi-features extraction. These features include entropy, spectral, and cepstral coefficients domains. Then, fuzzy logic-based optimization has been introduced in order to achieve the selective features by converting them into codewords. These nominated features with enhanced patterns are further detected by HMMs to improve the accuracy for classifying daily life locomotion actions. This paper also introduces another state-of-the-art way to model daily locomotion detection and derives body-specific modified HMMs. The model divides the sensor data into three active body-specific parts including head sensors, mid-body sensors, and lower body sensors. Body-specific modified HMMs have been provided with raw data for the three active body-specific sensors and gave better results with less computational complexities when compared to the conventional methods. The proposed systems have been experimentally assessed and trialed over three diverse publicly available datasets: the UP-Fall dataset consisting of falling and other daily life activities, the IM-WSHA dataset comprising everyday locomotion actions, and the ENABL3S gait and locomotion dataset consisting of multiple gait movements. Experimental outcomes indicate that the proposed conventional technique achieved improved results and outperformed existing systems based on detection accuracies of 90.0% and 87.5% over UP-Fall, 86.0% and 88.3% over IM-WSHA, and 86.7% and 90.0% over ENABL3S datasets for kinematic and static energy patterns, respectively. Further, the results show that the state-of-the-art body-specific modified HMMs method achieved 94.3% and 95.0% over UP-Fall, 92.0% and 93.3% over IM-WSHA, and 90.0% and 95.0% over ENABL3S datasets for kinematic and static patterned signals, respectively. The results of state-of-the-art efficient system show a significant increase in detection accuracy when compared to standard systems.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Stress is a serious health problem that affects a large part of humanity. Early stress detection helps preventing stress-related health problems. The Internet of Things (IoT) plays an important role in healthcare monitoring. In this paper, we present an automatic stress detection system (QASIS), to increases the effectiveness and efficiency of healthcare system providing services. QASIS benefits of emerging wearable physiological sensors, specifically, electromyograph (EMG), electrocardiogram (ECG), and nasal/oral airow, to monitors physical, cognitive and emotional stress. Our system uses an Extra Trees Classifier to achieve expected results in the areas like car driving. We also illustrate how the reliability of the contextual information represented by QoC metrics, can enhance the accuracy of the stress detection system. We conducted a stress detection experiment with twenty-six subjects. We confirmed that the proposed system could effectively detect stress, based on the measured breathing rate and the electrical activity of the heart and the muscles.

AB  - Joint angle quantification from inertial measurement units (IMUs) is commonly performed using kinematic modelling, which depends on anatomical sensor placement and/or functional joint calibration; however, accurate three-dimensional joint motion measurement remains challenging to achieve. The aims of this study were firstly to employ deep neural networks to convert IMU data to ankle joint angles that are indistinguishable from those derived from motion capture-based inverse kinematics (IK) - the reference standard; and secondly, to validate the robustness of this approach across contrasting walking speeds in healthy individuals. Kinematics data were simultaneously calculated using IMUs and IK from 9 subjects during walking on a treadmill at 0.5 m/s, 1.0 m/s and 1.5 m/s. A generative adversarial network was trained using gait data at two of the walking speeds to predict ankle kinematics from IMU data alone for the third walking speed. There were significant differences between IK and IMU joint angle predictions for ankle eversion and internal rotation during walking at 0.5 m/s and 1.0 m/s (p < 0.001); however, no significant differences in joint angles were observed between the generative adversarial network prediction and IK at any speed or plane of joint motion (p < 0.05). The RMS difference in ankle joint kinematics between the generative adversarial network and IK for walking at 1.0 m/s was 3.8°, 2.1° and 3.5° for dorsiflexion, inversion and axial rotation, respectively. The modeling approach presented for real-time IMU to ankle joint angle conversion, which can be readily expanded to other joints, may provide enhanced IMU capability in applications such as telemedicine, remote monitoring and rehabilitation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The role of artificial intelligence (AI) in facilitating the real-time processing of data is revolutionising the future of healthcare through mobile diagnostics, remote monitoring devices, and wearable technology products. The rise in digital wearables for remote healthcare is evolving at an increasing pace towards patient-centred and personalised care with connected patients. This transformation is creating new opportunities for designers to increase patients' participation and sustain their engagement in remote healthcare. In this paper, the authors have investigated the role of gender in aesthetic design in the context of digital health wearables to enhance user engagement and interaction. The investigations were conducted through participatory design sessions and showed a constructive relationship between aesthetic preferences and understanding the influence of gender as a means of facilitating user engagement with digital health wearables. This paper presents a novel user response model that leads to suggestions for future work, including research in the areas of gender awareness in aesthetics to move beyond traditional, stereotypical, and pre-identified gendered characteristics related to femininity and masculinity. The findings conclude with a path forwards for design research to promote gender awareness in aesthetic design for the realisation of healthcare wearables of the future. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - At present, the novel coronavirus is posing a bigger threat to the whole human race. However, adopting emerging technologies like the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, blockchain technology, and machine learning helps in a greater deal to handle the pandemic effectively. The virus has cost many human lives, and one primary reason could be neglecting the symptoms. The earlier identification of the disease will help in providing immediate medical support. Wearable devices are effective in identifying the coronavirus disease, i.e., COVID-19 cases than the traditional methods. They help in improved tracking and management of the disease. This paper intends to present a framework where the wearable devices associated with the Internet of Things (IoT) collect information from individuals and store it either in a cloud server or to a local fog computing node. Furthermore, the implementation of a decentralized storage system to collect, analyze, and preserve the gathered data among the healthcare professionals is also included in the system. The system takes advantage of blockchain systems to automate smart contracts. The goal of this research is to see how wearable gadgets might help combat COVID-19’s effects by providing efficient methods for identification, monitoring, and collaboration in remote patient monitoring. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - This work addresses the design, development and implementation of a 4.0-based wearable soft transducer for patient-centered vitals telemonitoring. In particular, first, the soft transducer measures hypertension-related vitals (heart rate, oxygen saturation and systolic/diastolic pressure) and sends the data to a remote database (which can be easily consulted both by the patient and the physician). In addition to this, a dedicated deep learning algorithm, based on a Long-Short-Term-Memory Autoencoder, was designed, implemented and tested for providing an alert when the patient’s vitals exceed certain thresholds, which are automatically personalized for the specific patient. Furthermore, a mobile application (EcO2u) was developed to manage the entire data flow and facilitate the data fruition; this application also implements an innovative face-detection algorithm that ensures the identity of the patient. The robustness of the proposed soft transducer was validated experimentally on five individuals, who used the system for 30 days. The experimental results demonstrated an accuracy in anomaly detection greater than 93%, with a true positive rate of more than 94%. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The use of wearables is increasing and data from these devices could improve the prediction of changes in glycemic control. We conducted a randomized trial with adults with prediabetes who were given either a waist-worn or wrist-worn wearable to track activity patterns. We collected baseline information on demographics, medical history, and laboratory testing. We tested three models that predicted changes in hemoglobin A1c that were continuous, improved glycemic control by 5% or worsened glycemic control by 5%. Consistently in all three models, prediction improved when (a) machine learning was used vs. traditional regression, with ensemble methods performing the best; (b) baseline information with wearable data was used vs. baseline information alone; and (c) wrist-worn wearables were used vs. waist-worn wearables. These findings indicate that models can accurately identify changes in glycemic control among prediabetic adults, and this could be used to better allocate resources and target interventions to prevent progression to diabetes. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - The use of wearable sensors allows continuous recordings of physical activity from participants in free-living or at-home clinical studies. The large amount of data collected demands automatic analysis pipelines to extract gait parameters that can be used as clinical endpoints. We introduce a deep learning-based automatic pipeline for wearables that processes tri-axial accelerometry data and extracts gait events—bout segmentation, initial contact (IC), and final contact (FC)—from a single sensor located at either the lower back (near L5), shin or wrist. The gait events detected are posteriorly used for gait parameter estimation, such as step time, length, and symmetry. We report results from a leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) validation on a pilot study dataset of five participants clinically diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and six healthy controls (HC). Participants wore sensors at three body locations and walked on a pressure-sensing walkway to obtain reference gait data. Mean absolute errors (MAE) for the IC events ranged from 22.82 to 33.09 milliseconds (msecs) for the lower back sensor while for the shin and wrist sensors, MAE ranges were 28.56–64.66 and 40.19–72.50 msecs, respectively. For the FC-event detection, MAE ranges were 29.06–48.42, 40.19–72.70 and 36.06–60.18 msecs for the lumbar, wrist and shin sensors, respectively. Intraclass correlation coefficients, ICC(2,k), between the estimated parameters and the reference data resulted in good-to-excellent agreement (ICC ≥ 0.84) for the lumbar and shin sensors, excluding the double support time (ICC = 0.37 lumbar and 0.38 shin) and swing time (ICC = 0.55 lumbar and 0.59 shin). The wrist sensor also showed good agreements, but the ICCs were lower overall than for the other two sensors. Our proposed analysis pipeline has the potential to extract up to 100 gait-related parameters, and we expect our contribution will further support developments in the fields of wearable sensors, digital health, and remote monitoring in clinical trials. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Quality sleep is an inevitable part for the human life to have sound physical and mental health. Abnormal sleep patterns or sleep quality result in health issues. Sleep monitoring becomes mandatory for individuals to lead a healthy life. Adopting ubiquitous computing is on the rise in the healthcare sector, particularly in remote sleep monitoring. Recent advancements in sensor technology have increased the adoption of Internet of things (IoT), wearable, nearable and smartphones in remote sleep monitoring. The present remote monitoring systems heavily depend on existing communication techniques for transferring the sensor data to the remote computer or cloud. The existing communication systems have issues such as connectivity of devices, M2M communication, latency, and throughput. This chapter discusses the various recent remote sleep monitoring methods using the IoT, wearable, nearable, smartphone apps, and the role of 5G in remote sleep monitoring. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - In the modern world, the mortality pace has increased and many people are still dying every day from several health complications. The proposed structure of an interconnected healthcare device is to regularly monitor the health condition of a patient as well as provide prompt notification to overcome such difficulties when they're out their regular lifestyle. To supply essential medical information for the patient in the early stages of an unusual event, the device has integrated sensors into it. When sensing a suspicious incident, by connecting with a personalized mobile app over the web, the device is to notify close relatives and physicians and it can send those emails and text messages. An alarm button allows patients to request assistance. The system tracks the physical activity, cardiac activity, and temperature of the patient to help the physician assess the illness. An electronic Sensor Module circuitry monitors the heart rate. The three-axis MEMS accelerometer sensor helps in the direction of identifying the daily body action of the monitored women. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Smart sensors, coupled with artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled remote automated monitoring (RAMs), can free a nurse from the task of in-person patient monitoring during the transportation process of patients between different wards in hospital settings. Automation of hospital beds using advanced robotics and sensors has been a growing trend exacerbated by the COVID crisis. In this exploratory study, a polynomial regression (PR) machine learning (ML) RAM algorithm based on a Dreyfusian descriptor for immediate wellbeing monitoring was proposed for the autonomous hospital bed transport (AHBT) application. This method was preferred over several other AI algorithm for its simplicity and quick computation. The algorithm quantified historical data using supervised photoplethysmography (PPG) data for 5 min just before the start of the autonomous journey, referred as pre-journey (PJ) dataset. During the transport process, the algorithm continued to quantify immediate measurements using non-overlapping sets of 30 PPG waveforms, referred as in-journey (IJ) dataset. In combination, this algorithm provided a binary decision condition that determined if AHBT should continue its journey to destination by checking the degree of polynomial (DoP) between PJ and IJ. Wrist PPG was used as algorithm’s monitoring parameter. PPG data was collected simultaneously from both wrists of 35 subjects, aged 21 and above in postures mimicking that in AHBT and were given full freedom of upper limb and wrist movement. It was observed that the top goodness-of-fit which indicated potentials for high data accountability had 0.2 to 0.6 cross validation score mean (CVSM) occurring at 8th to 10th DoP for PJ datasets and 0.967 to 0.994 CVSM at 9th to 10th DoP for IJ datasets. CVSM was a reliable metric to pick out the best PJ and IJ DoPs. Central tendency analysis showed that coinciding DoP distributions between PJ and IJ datasets, peaking at 8th DoP, was the precursor to high algorithm stability. Mean algorithm efficacy was 0.20 as our proposed algorithm was able to pick out all signals from a conscious subject having full freedom of movement. This efficacy was acceptable as a first ML proof of concept for AHBT. There was no observable difference between subjects’ left and right wrists. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Simultaneous monitoring of human motion and collecting ambient energy are important for the development of personal healthcare monitoring and artificial intelligence. Here, a flexible and stretchable coaxial triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) yarn is designed and fabricated by using coil spring as the inner support layer and mechanoluminescent ZnS:Cu/PDMS composite as the outer friction layer. By weaving coaxial TENG yarns, or mix-weaving with other yarns, a multifunctional TENG fabric can be manufactured for energy harvesting external mechanical energy from human motion or ambient environment. More important, it can self-powered sense human motion in both electrical (through TENG) and optical (from mechanoluminescent ZnS:Cu/PDMS composite) methods. This work provides a new strategy for wearable TENG fabrics with dual-mode sensing and energy harvesting which have potential applications in long-term medical monitoring and human-machine interaction systems. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Heart failure (HF) patients represent one of the most prevalent as well as one of the most fragile population encountered in the cardiology and internal medicine departments nowadays. Estimated to account for around 26 million people worldwide, diagnosed patients present a poor prognosis and quality of life with a clinical history accompanied by repeated hospital admissions caused by an exacerbation of their chronic condition. The frequent hospitalizations and the extended hospital stays mean an extremely high economic burden for healthcare institutions. Meanwhile, the number of chronically diseased and elderly patients is continuously rising, and a lack of specialized physicians is evident. To cope with this health emergency, more efficient strategies for patient management, more accurate diagnostic tools, and more efficient preventive plans are needed. In recent years, telemonitoring has been introduced as the potential answer to solve such needs. Different methodologies and devices have been progressively investigated for effective home monitoring of cardiologic patients. Invasive hemodynamic devices, such as CardioMEMS™, have been demonstrated to be reducing hospitalizations and mortality, but their use is however restricted to limited cases. The role of external non-invasive devices for remote patient monitoring, instead, is yet to be clarified. In this review, we summarized the most relevant studies and devices that, by utilizing non-invasive telemonitoring, demonstrated whether beneficial effects in the management of HF patients were effective. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Patient gesture recognition is a promising method to gain knowledge and assist patients. Healthcare monitoring systems integrated with the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm to perform the remote solutions for the acquiring inputs. In recent years, wearable sensors, and information and communication technologies are assisting for remote monitoring and recommendations in smart healthcare. In this paper, the dependable gesture recognition (DGR) using a series learning method for identifying the action of patient monitoring through remote access is presented. The gesture recognition systems connect to the end-user (remote) and the patient for instantaneous gesture identification. The gesture is recognized by the analysis of the intermediate and structuring features using series learning. The proposed gesture recognition system is capable of monitoring patient activities and differentiating the gestures from the regular actions to improve the convergence. Gesture recognition through remote monitoring is indistinguishable due to the preliminary errors. Further, it is convertible using series learning. Therefore, the misdetections and classifications are promptly identified using the DGR and verified by comparative analysis and experimental study. From the analysis, the proposed DGR approach attains 94.92% high precision for the varying gestures and 89.85% high accuracy for varying mess factor. The proposed DGR reduces recognition time to 4.97 s and 4.93 s for the varying gestures and mess factor, respectively. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - There is a massive transformation in the traditional healthcare system from the specialist-centric approach to the patient-centric approach by adopting modern and intelligent healthcare solutions to build a smart healthcare system. It permits patients to directly share their medical data with the specialist for remote diagnosis without any human intervention. Furthermore, the remote monitoring of patients utilizing wearable sensors, Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, and artificial intelligence (AI) has made the treatment readily accessible and affordable. However, the advancement also brings several security and privacy concerns that poorly maneuvered the effective performance of the smart healthcare system. An attacker can exploit the IoT infrastructure, perform an adversarial attack on AI models, and proliferate resource starvation attacks in smart healthcare system. To overcome the aforementioned issues, in this survey, we extensively reviewed and created a comprehensive taxonomy of various smart healthcare technologies such as wearable devices, digital healthcare, and body area networks (BANs), along with their security aspects and solutions for the smart healthcare system. Moreover, we propose an AI-based architecture with the 6G network interface to secure the data exchange between patients and medical practitioners. We have examined our proposed architecture with the case study based on the COVID-19 pandemic by adopting unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for data exchange. The performance of the proposed architecture is evaluated using various machine learning (ML) classification algorithms such as random forest (RF), naive Bayes (NB), logistic regression (LR), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and perceptron. The RF classification algorithm outperforms the conventional algorithms in terms of accuracy, i.e., 98%. Finally, we present open issues and research challenges associated with smart healthcare technologies.  © 2022 Sachi Chaudhary et al.

AB  - Background and objective: E-health is a growing research topic, especially with the expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT). Miniaturized wearable sensors are auspicious tools for biomedicine and healthcare systems. In this paper, we present D-SORM, a sensor fusion-based digital solution intended to assist clinicians and improve their diagnosis by providing objective measurements and automatic recognition. The aim is to supply an interface for remote monitoring to the medical staff. Methods: D-SORM platform estimates the wearable device attitude based on its acquired data, and visualizes it in real-time using a graphical user interface (GUI). It also integrates two modules which serve two different medical applications. The first one is arm tele-rehabilitation, where sessions are done online. The practitioner gives the instructions while wearing the device, and the patient has to reproduce the gestures. A processing unit is dedicated to compute statistical features and calculate the success rate. The second one is human motion tracking for elderly care. A novel machine learning architecture is proposed, based on feature fusion, to predict the activities of daily living. Results: The rehabilitation mechanism was tested under supervised conditions, by performing a set of movements. D-SORM provides extra information and objective measurements, thus facilitates the diagnosis of clinicians. The human activity recognition is also validated using a public dataset. With D-SORM, an efficiency ranging from 97.7% to 99.65% is ensured under unsupervised conditions. Conclusions: The proposed design constitutes a digital clinical tool for medical teams allowing remote health monitoring. It overcomes geographical barriers while providing faster and highly accurate assessment. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Purpose of reviewArtificial intelligence is the ability for machines to perform intelligent tasks. Artificial intelligence is already penetrating many aspects of medicine including cardiac surgery. Here, we offer a platform introduction to artificial intelligence for cardiac surgeons to understand the implementations of this transformative tool.Recent findingsArtificial intelligence has contributed greatly to the automation of cardiac imaging, including echocardiography, cardiac computed tomography, cardiac MRI and most recently, in radiomics. There are also several artificial intelligence based clinical prediction tools that predict complex outcomes after cardiac surgery. Waveform analysis, specifically, automated electrocardiogram analysis, has seen significant strides with promise in wearables and remote monitoring. Experimentally, artificial intelligence has also entered the operating room in the form of augmented reality and automated robotic surgery.SummaryArtificial intelligence has many potential exciting applications in cardiac surgery. It can streamline physician workload and help make medicine more human again by placing the physician back at the bedside. Here, we offer cardiac surgeons an introduction to this transformative tool so that they may actively participate in creating clinically relevant implementations to improve our practice. © 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

AB  - Modern wearable healthcare devices require new technologies with resource efficiency in terms of high performance, low energy consumption and diagnostic accuracy. In the field of artificial intelligence, the convolutional neural network (CNN) has performed as an effective algorithm. Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have been extensively utilised to construct hardware accelerators for CNNs. This paper suggests using an accelerator to create a specific 1-D CNN to classify the electrogram (ExG). ExGs used here include electrocardiogram, electroencephalogram and electromyography. The pipelined structure is designed with a register in the middle to facilitate easy data transfer. A 1-D CNN using an accelerator to categorise ExG signals implemented on Xilinx Zynq xc7z045 platform outperforms FPGA peer applications on the same platform by 1.14× in terms of speed. In addition, the 1-D CNN proposed accelerator operates very efficiently due to the use of a tristate buffer in the multiplexer and the substitution of the shift for the multiplier, resulting in a resource-efficient accelerator with 161 GOP/s/W energy efficiency and 28 GOP/s/KLUT, an improvement of 1.67 over the previous model. Finally, the performance of the accelerator applied to a Xilinx Zynq xc7z045 FPGA operating at 442.948MHz was calculated, achieving 1.145 TFLOP/s. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The application of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques in the medical world is growing, with a range of purposes: from the identification and prediction of possible diseases to patient monitoring and clinical decision support systems. Furthermore, the widespread use of remote monitoring medical devices, under the umbrella of the “Internet of Medical Things” (IoMT), has simplified the retrieval of patient information as they allow continuous monitoring and direct access to data by healthcare providers. However, due to possible issues in real-world settings, such as loss of connectivity, irregular use, misuse, or poor adherence to a monitoring program, the data collected might not be sufficient to implement accurate algorithms. For this reason, data augmentation techniques can be used to create synthetic datasets sufficiently large to train machine learning models. In this work, we apply the concept of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to perform a data augmentation from patient data obtained through IoMT sensors for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) monitoring. We also apply an explainable AI algorithm to demonstrate the accuracy of the synthetic data by comparing it to the real data recorded by the sensors. The results obtained demonstrate how synthetic datasets created through a well-structured GAN are comparable with a real dataset, as validated by a novel approach based on machine learning. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Patients with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) are at a high risk of malignant ventricular arrhythmias. The use of remote ICD monitoring, wearable devices, and patient-reported outcomes generate large volumes of potential valuable data. Artificial intelligence–based methods can be used to develop personalized prediction models and improve early-warning systems. Objective: The purpose of this study was to develop an integrated web-based personalized prediction engine for ICD therapy. Methods: This international, multicenter, prospective, observational study consists of 2 phases: (1) a development study and (2) a feasibility study. We plan to enroll 400 participants with an ICD (with or without cardiac resynchronization therapy) on remote monitoring: 300 participants in the development study and 100 in the feasibility study. During 12-month follow-up, electronic health record data, remote monitoring data, accelerometry-assessed physical behavior data, and patient-reported data are collected. By using machine- and deep-learning approaches, a prediction engine is developed to assess the risk probability of ICD therapy (shock and antitachycardia pacing). The feasibility of the prediction engine as a clinical tool, the SafeHeart Platform, is assessed during the feasibility study. Results: Development study recruitment commenced in 2021. The feasibility study starts in 2022. Conclusion: SafeHeart is the first study to prospectively collect a multimodal data set to construct a personalized prediction engine for ICD therapy. Moreover, SafeHeart explores the integration and added value of detailed objective accelerometer data in the prediction of clinical events. The translation of the SafeHeart Platform to clinical practice is examined during the feasibility study. © 2021 Heart Rhythm Society

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption of innovative healthcare methods, including remote patient monitoring. In the setting of limited healthcare resources, outpatient management of individuals newly diagnosed with COVID-19 was commonly implemented, some taking advantage of various personal health technologies, but only rarely using a multi-parameter chest-patch for continuous monitoring. Here we describe the development and validation of a COVID-19 decompensation index (CDI) model based on chest patch-derived continuous sensor data to predict COVID-19 hospitalizations in outpatient-managed COVID-19 positive individuals, achieving an overall AUC of the ROC Curve of 0.84 on 308 event negative participants, and 22 event positive participants, out of an overall study cohort of 400 participants. We retrospectively compare the performance of CDI to standard of care modalities, finding that the machine learning model outperforms the standard of care modalities in terms of both numbers of events identified and with a lower false alarm rate. While only a pilot phase study, the CDI represents a promising application of machine learning within a continuous remote patient monitoring system. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - The eruption of chronic diseases such as COVID-19 has re-emphasized the need for people all over the world to have access to urgent healthcare. The latest pandemic has shown the flaws in the conventional healthcare system, namely that hospitals and clinics alone are incapable of dealing with such a crisis. Smart and integrated wearables are one of the main technologies that favor modern healthcare solutions (Godi, B., Viswanadham, S., Muttipati, A.S., Prakash Samantray, O., Gadiraju student, S.R.: E-Healthcare Monitoring System using IoT with Machine Learning Approaches. In: 2020 International Conference on Computer Science, Engineering and Applications (ICCSEA). pp. 1–5. IEEE, Gunupur, India (2020). https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSEA49143.2020.9132937 ). These wearables can now gather data on an unparalleled scale thanks to advancements in the Internet of Things (IoT). Healthcare is among many fields that have been transformed by IoT, with the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) systems being introduced as an IoT branch. Patients with chronic diseases can be monitored remotely using IoMT systems. As a result, it can offer prompt diagnostics to patients, potentially saving their lives in the event of an emergency. However, protection in these vital systems is a major issue that has arisen as a result of their widespread use. This paper presents an overview of the technologies that are being used on IoMT as well as some security problems found in the literature. This survey will give an insight to the readers regarding the importance of security in healthcare and the different machine learning methods used to address that issue. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Healthcare is an effective factor and one of the most important primary capabilities of a human life. Nowadays, Internet of Things (IoT) is important in all fields, including healthcare and medical industries due to the increased use of Wi-Fi sensors. The implementation of new machine intelligence-based technological e-healthcare development and e-healthcare parameters will now involve and include Internet and Wi-Fi sensors, which are commonly referred to as Internet of Things (IoT). Machine intelligence enables and activates a global approach to the development of healthcare monitoring-based systems. Machine intelligence is the development of machines, and intelligence necessitates a significant amount of relevant knowledge. Manual health monitoring is becoming more difficult in today’s busy world. This system establishes a real-time approach and provides a set of specifications. This information is relevant to the health of the monitored patients. Many countries are reporting an increase in the number of deaths as a result of a lack of certain factors, such as timely medical treatments and a monitoring system. This paper has proposed a smart healthcare methodology for monitoring the patients by involving healthcare sensors to reduce doctor’s workload in order to detect the heartbeat and body temperature and inform the doctor as well as attending hospital staff about the patients’ status by providing accurate results. The proposed system employs the KNN algorithm to forecast the patient’s condition in able to prevent the patient from becoming further ill. The proposed system also includes a buzzer beeping situation, which means that if the beeping occurs, the nurse must be notified of the patient’s emergency situation. The existing system did not include a predicting component. As a result, the proposed system provides accurate results for patients, allowing them to easily handle the emergency situation. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - In this article, we present current methodologies, available technologies, and demands for monitoring various respiratory parameters. We discuss the importance of noninvasive techniques for remote and continuous monitoring and challenges involved in the current 'smart and connected health' era. We conducted an extensive literature review on the medical significance of monitoring respiratory vital parameters, along with the current methods and solutions with their respective advantages and disadvantages. We discuss the challenges of developing a noninvasive, wearable, wireless system that continuously monitors respiration parameters and opportunities in the field and then determine the requirements of a state-of-the-art system. Noninvasive techniques provide a significant amount of medical information for a continuous patient monitoring system. Contact methods offer more advantages than non-contact methods; however, reducing the size and power of contact methods is critical for enabling a wearable, wireless medical monitoring system. Continuous and accurate remote monitoring, along with other physiological data, can help caregivers improve the quality of care and allow patients greater freedom outside the hospital. Such monitoring systems could lead to highly tailored treatment plans, shorten patient stays at medical facilities, and reduce the cost of treatment. © 2008-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Introduction Diabetes prevalence continues to grow and there remains a significant diagnostic gap in one-third of the US population that has pre-diabetes. Innovative, practical strategies to improve monitoring of glycemic health are desperately needed. In this proof-of-concept study, we explore the relationship between non-invasive wearables and glycemic metrics and demonstrate the feasibility of using non-invasive wearables to estimate glycemic metrics, including hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and glucose variability metrics. Research design and methods We recorded over 25 000 measurements from a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) with simultaneous wrist-worn wearable (skin temperature, electrodermal activity, heart rate, and accelerometry sensors) data over 8-10 days in 16 participants with normal glycemic state and pre-diabetes (HbA1c 5.2-6.4). We used data from the wearable to develop machine learning models to predict HbA1c recorded on day 0 and glucose variability calculated from the CGM. We tested the accuracy of the HbA1c model on a retrospective, external validation cohort of 10 additional participants and compared results against CGM-based HbA1c estimation models. Results A total of 250 days of data from 26 participants were collected. Out of the 27 models of glucose variability metrics that we developed using non-invasive wearables, 11 of the models achieved high accuracy (<10% mean average per cent error, MAPE). Our HbA1c estimation model using non-invasive wearables data achieved MAPE of 5.1% on an external validation cohort. The ranking of wearable sensor's importance in estimating HbA1c was skin temperature (33%), electrodermal activity (28%), accelerometry (25%), and heart rate (14%). Conclusions This study demonstrates the feasibility of using non-invasive wearables to estimate glucose variability metrics and HbA1c for glycemic monitoring and investigates the relationship between non-invasive wearables and the glycemic metrics of glucose variability and HbA1c. The methods used in this study can be used to inform future studies confirming the results of this proof-of-concept study.  ©

AB  - COVID-19 exerts deleterious cardiopulmonary effects, leading to a worse prognosis in the most affected. This retrospective multi-center observational cohort study aimed to analyze the trajectories of key vitals amongst hospitalized COVID-19 patients using a chest-patch wearable providing continuous remote patient monitoring of numerous vital signs. The study was conducted in five COVID-19 isolation units. A total of 492 COVID-19 patients were included in the final analysis. Physiological parameters were measured every 15 min. More than 3 million measurements were collected including heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, cardiac output, cardiac index, systemic vascular resistance, respiratory rate, blood oxygen saturation, and body temperature. Cardiovascular deterioration appeared early after admission and in parallel with changes in the respiratory parameters, showing a significant difference in trajectories within sub-populations at high risk. Early detection of cardiovascular deterioration of COVID-19 patients is achievable when using frequent remote patient monitoring. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Intelligent color-changing textiles have attracted increasing attention due to their potential application in healthcare monitoring and artificial intelligence. To realize the active modulation of color via sunlight, the photothermochromic fabric that adjusts its color based on the photothermal conversion performance of the sunlight-responsive heating layer under irradiation of solar is fabricated by double-side coating. Depending on the light absorption at 350–2500 nm, the sunlight-responsive photothermochromic fabric (SPTCF) exposed under the irradiation power density of 500 W m−2 for 4 min displays efficient photothermal conversion, resulting in the increase in temperature from room temperature (23.0 °C) to above 47.0 °C. Simultaneously, the color of SPTCF changes from blue to white and returns to blue once the light is turned off for 3 min, indicating the sensitive and reversible photothermochromic property of the SPTCF. Compared with the contrast layer, the sunlight-responsive heating layer exhibits a rapid photothermal conversion speed and high optical contrast under the same irradiation condition. The heating/cooling curves show steady signals after mechanical deformations and 150 cycles, revealing the favorable durability of the SPTCF under the solar irradiation. The sensitive photothermochromic properties promote the application of the SPTCF in smart wearable fields. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH

AB  - In the past few years, remote monitoring technologies have grown increasingly important in the delivery of healthcare. According to healthcare professionals, a variety of factors influence the public perception of connected healthcare systems in a variety of ways. First and foremost, wearable technology in healthcare must establish better bonds with the individuals who will be using them. The emotional reactions of patients to obtaining remote healthcare services may be of interest to healthcare practitioners if they are given the opportunity to investigate them. In this study, we develop an artificial intelligence-based classification system that aims to detect the emotions from the input data using metaheuristic feature selection and machine learning classification. The proposed model is made to undergo series of steps involving preprocessing, feature selection, and classification. The simulation is conducted to test the efficacy of the model on various features present in a dataset. The results of simulation show that the proposed model is effective enough to classify the emotions from the input dataset than other existing methods.  © 2022 Gouse Baig Mohammad et al.

AB  - Tremendous scientific and technological achievements have been revolutionizing the current medical era, changing the way in which physicians practice their profession and deliver healthcare provisions. This is due to the convergence of various advancements related to digitalization and the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs)—ranging from the internet of things (IoT) and the internet of medical things (IoMT) to the fields of robotics, virtual and augmented reality, and massively parallel and cloud computing. Further progress has been made in the fields of addictive manufacturing and three-dimensional (3D) printing, sophisticated statistical tools such as big data visualization and analytics (BDVA) and artificial intelligence (AI), the use of mobile and smartphone applications (apps), remote monitoring and wearable sensors, and e-learning, among others. Within this new conceptual framework, big data represents a massive set of data characterized by different properties and features. These can be categorized both from a quantitative and qualitative standpoint, and include data generated from wet-lab and microarrays (molecular big data), databases and registries (clinical/computational big data), imaging techniques (such as radiomics, imaging big data) and web searches (the so-called infodemiology, digital big data). The present review aims to show how big and smart data can revolutionize gynecology by shedding light on female reproductive health, both in terms of physiology and pathophysiology. More specifically, they appear to have potential uses in the field of gynecology to increase its accuracy and precision, stratify patients, provide opportunities for personalized treatment options rather than delivering a package of “one-size-fits-it-all” healthcare management provisions, and enhance its effectiveness at each stage (health promotion, prevention, diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutics). © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Remote monitoring of physical frailty is important to personalize care for slowing down the frailty process and/or for the healthy recovery of older adults following acute or chronic stressors. Taking the Fried frailty criteria as a reference to determine physical frailty and frailty phenotypes (slowness, weakness, exhaustion, inactivity), this study aimed to explore the benefit of machine learning to determine the least number of digital biomarkers of physical frailty measurable from a pendant sensor during activities of daily living. Two hundred and fifty-nine older adults were classified into robust or pre-frail/frail groups based on the physical frailty assessments by the Fried frailty criteria. All participants wore a pendant sensor at the sternum level for 48 h. Of seventeen sensor-derived features extracted from a pendant sensor, fourteen significant features were used for machine learning based on logistic regression modeling and a recursive feature elimination technique incorporating bootstrapping. The combination of percentage time standing, percentage time walking, walking cadence, and longest walking bout were identified as optimal digital biomarkers of physical frailty and frailty phenotypes. These findings suggest that a combination of sensor-measured exhaustion, inactivity, and speed have potential to screen and monitor people for physical frailty and frailty phenotypes. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Objective We report on our experience of deploying a continuous remote patient monitoring (CRPM) study soft launch with structured cascading and escalation pathways on heart failure (HF) patients post-discharge. The lessons learned from the soft launch are used to modify and fine-tune the workflow process and study protocol. Methods This soft launch was conducted at NorthShore University HealthSystem's Evanston Hospital from December 2020 to March 2021. Patients were provided with non-invasive wearable biosensors that continuously collect ambulatory physiological data, and a study phone that collects patient-reported outcomes. The physiological data are analyzed by machine learning algorithms, potentially identifying physiological perturbation in HF patients. Alerts from this algorithm may be cascaded with other patient status data to inform home health nurses' (HHNs') management via a structured protocol. HHNs review the monitoring platform daily. If the patient's status meets specific criteria, HHNs perform assessments and escalate patient cases to the HF team for further guidance on early intervention. Results We enrolled five patients into the soft launch. Four participants adhered to study activities. Two out of five patients were readmitted, one due to HF, one due to infection. Observed miscommunication and protocol gaps were noted for protocol amendment. The study team adopted an organizational development method from change management theory to reconfigure the study protocol. Conclusion We sought to automate the monitoring aspects of post-discharge care by aligning a new technology that generates streaming data from a wearable device with a complex, multi-provider workflow into a novel protocol using iterative design, implementation, and evaluation methods to monitor post-discharge HF patients. CRPM with structured escalation and telemonitoring protocol shows potential to maintain patients in their home environment and reduce HF-related readmissions. Our results suggest that further education to engage and empower frontline workers using advanced technology is essential to scale up the approach. © 2021 American Academy of Audiology.

AB  - Diabetes is a metabolic disease that affects millions of people each year. It is associated with an increased likelihood of vital organ failures and decreased quality of life. Early detection and regular monitoring are crucial for managing diabetes. Remote patient monitoring can facilitate effective intervention and treatment paradigms using current technology. This work proposes an end-to-end remote monitoring framework for automated diabetes risk prediction and management, using personal health devices, smart wearables and smartphones. A support vector machine was developed for diabetes risk prediction using the Pima Indian Diabetes Database, after feature scaling, imputation, selection and augmentation. This work achieved the performance metrics of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity scores at 83.20%, 87.20% and 79% respectively through the tenfold stratified cross validation method, which is competitive with existing methods. Patients can use multiple healthcare devices, smartphones and smartwatches to measure vital parameters, curb the progression of diabetes and close the communication loop with medical professionals. The proposed framework enables medical professionals to make informed decisions based on the latest diabetes risk predictions and lifestyle insights while attaining unobtrusiveness, reduced cost, and vendor interoperability. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Recently, flexible wearable electronic devices have attracted immense interest as an alternative for conventional rigid metallic conductors in personal healthcare monitoring, human motion detection, and sensory skins, owing to their intrinsic characteristics. However, the practical applications of most wearable sensors are generally limited by their poor stretchability and sensitivity, unsatisfactory strength, lower conductivity, and single sensory function. Here a hydrogen bond cross-linked network based on carboxylic styrene butadiene rubber (XSBR) and hydrophilic sericin (SS) non-covalently modified carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is rationally designed and then fabricated into multi-functional sensors. The resultant versatile sensors are able to detect both weak and large deformations, which owns a low detection limit of 1% strain, high stretchability up to 217%, superior strength of 12.58 MPa, high sensitivity with a gauge factor up to 25.98, high conductivity of 0.071 S m−1, and lower percolation threshold of 0.504 wt%. Moreover, the prepared sensors also possess an impressively thermal response (0.01636 °C−1) and realize the application in the measurement of human body temperature. The multifunctional and scalable XSBR/SSCNT sensor with the integrated tracking capabilities of real-time and in situ physiological signals, providing a promising route to develop wearable artificial intelligence in human health and sporting applications. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH

AB  - The classification of simple and complex sequences of operations is made easier according to the use of heterogeneous sensors from a wearable device. Sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) is being used in smartphone platforms for elderly healthcare monitoring, fall detection, and inappropriate behavior prevention, such as smoking habit, unhealthy eating, and lack of exercise. Common machine learning and deep learning techniques have recently been presented to tackle the HAR issue, with a focus on everyday activities, particularly general human activities including moving, sitting, and standing. However, there is an intriguing and challenging HAR research subjects involving more complicated psychological activities in various environments, including smoking, eating, and drinking. The use of heterogeneous sensor data to enhance recognition performance over sensor-based deep learning networks is considered in this work. We demonstrate that using a combination of two inertial measurement units outperforms employing either an accelerometer or a gyroscope by utilizing four deep learning classifiers to recognize complex human activity (CHA). Furthermore, we describe the impact of five window sizes (5s - 40s) on a publicly accessible benchmark dataset and how increasing window size effects to the classification performance of CHA deep learning networks.  © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - In today's world of medical science, remote patient monitoring devices are becoming more important and a future need particularly in the present COVID-19 situation as individuals are preferred to be kept isolated. Patients would be benefited from a suitable monitoring system that measures their important medical parameters such as pulse rate, oxygen saturation or SpO2, body temperature, blood pressure, and Galvanized Skin Response (GSR). This system can increase the medical staff efficiency by drastically decreasing their duties in hospitals and the need to attend to them individually. Patients in their home isolation may utilize the device as well, and their vital indicators may be checked by doctors remotely. In this work, we are prototyping a powerefficient, wearable medical kit and a resource-aware fog network set up to handle the Internet of Things (IoT) data traffic. The idea behind the design is to process the critical medical sensors' data in the fog nodes which are deployed at the edge of the network. The data thus received, is used for a machine learning-based solution for personal health anomalies and COVID-19 infection risk analysis. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - The covid-19 pandemic has brought changes in various sectors like healthcare, business, education and economy. Due to the large spread of covid-19 in a lot of countries there is shortage of hospital beds, oxygen supply and healthcare workers. So, the pandemic generated need to use smart pioneering technologies like Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things to monitor patient in an effective way. In this research paper a prototype is proposed based on IoT and AI for monitoring home quarantine covid-19 patients. Wearable IoT devices automatically collect information like oxygen level, temperature of body, etc. with the help of integrated sensors. Coughing is one of the most noticeable symptoms of people infected with covid-19. Frequency of cough is detected using Tensor flow library of Deep learning model. This prototype is a way to make IoT sensors smarter enough to detect coughs with the help of a trained model. Coughing dataset is collected and labelled manually. Dataset is self-created and categorized into cough and noise. Cough detection is based on MFCC features using DNN and CNN. The use of these technologies can bring a quick transition in healthcare to avoid risks caused with the life of human beings. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - As the very first big outbreak in our era, COVID-19 offers an outstanding incentive to legislators, and regulatory authorities should find procedural viability, moral validity, and usefulness of implementation in the time of new healthcare technologies. This chapter addresses the outbreak of coronavirus and how digital healthcare technologies can help navigate and resolve COVID-19 and future epidemics. As the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-2019) spreads, technological advancements and efforts to control the disease, manage clients safely, and promote teamwork among overburdened health care practitioners designing innovative, efficient vaccines would be critical. This review looks at how various healthcare scientific sectors are assisting in the fight against the pandemic, as well as how innovative implementations are being used to treat or cure illness. An analysis of the technical landscape in the COVID-19 sense enables some tentative reflections about the conditions of technical involvement in fighting this once-in-a-century pandemic. Firstly, unlike previous global health crises, it seems to turn people from monitoring artefacts and epidemiological analysis through information creation topics via self-tracking, information sharing, and digital information flows. Furthermore, even if many of such innovations were not implemented, in a previous medical crisis background, their extensive usage on a world basis raises concern about the extent of mobilising domestic spying techniques on racial equality and also worries about government agencies retaining higher monitoring rates long after the end of the pandemic. Within the recent epidemic framework, advanced technical technologies in data analysis and remote monitoring of the urgent laws that require the immediate termination of human rights and the approval of medical equipment and vaccinations by fast-tracking processes have been implemented. Everyone knows that digital healthcare technologies are progressively being embraced in this field for fighting against the COVID-19 pandemic. This chapter produced an overview to explain all the efforts being made towards this pandemic in digital healthcare tech. Healthcare centres throughout the world are transitioning to the new technologies listed below to help ease their workload, either by increasing the speed diagnostics or allowing physicians to monitor patients who have been virtually quarantined. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Efficient remote monitoring of the patient infected with coronavirus without spread to healthcare workers is the need of the hour. An effectual and faster communication system must be established wherein the healthcare workers at the remote quarantine ward can communicate with healthcare professionals present in specialty hospitals. Incidentally, there is a need to establish a contactless smart cloud-based connection between a specialty hospital and quarantine wards during pandemic situation. This paper proposes an initial contactless web-based tele-health clinical decision support system that integrates near-field communication (NFC) tags and a smart cloud-based structuring tool that enables the quick diagnosis of patients with COVID-19 symptoms and monitors the remotely located quarantine wards during the recent pandemic. The proposed framework consists of three-stages: (i) contactless health parameter extraction from the patient using an NFC tag; (ii) converting medical report into digital text using optical character recognition algorithm and extracting values of relevant medical-parameters using natural language processing; and (iii) smart visualization of key medical parameters. The accuracy of the proposed system from NFC reader until analysis using a novel structuring algorithm deployed in the cloud is more than 94%. Several capabilities of the proposed web-based system were compared with similar systems and tested in an authentic mock clinical setup, and the physicians found that the system is reliable and user friendly.

AB  - Blood pressure issues are related to many illnesses threatening human health and require continuous control and monitoring. Health telemonitoring is an innovative solution allowing wellbeing and increasing autonomy of patients. Moreover, machine learning algorithms are a viable method used in recent studies for analyzing, predicting, and classifying health data while improving the health conditions of telemonitoring and telediagnosis. The main purpose of this article is to employ machine learning algorithms for Blood Pressure (BP) measurement classification in real-time. Data is gathered from the human body through a multilevel Wireless Medical Sensors Network (WMSN) architecture that is deployed to acquire, analyze, and monitor BP remotely. The first layer of the proposed architecture performs BP measurement, classification, and transmission to the second layer using a wearable sensor. The learning of classifiers is established with Cross-Validation to avoid over-fitting and to improve the performance while comparing the Decision Tree, K-Nearest-Neighbors, and Naive Bayes algorithms. Afterward, the best classifier is implemented in the BP sensor node to identify the BP status. The second layer is responsible for data aggregation in the Cloud and alerting when an anomaly occurs in BP measurement. The third layer is configured to present BP information continuously to the health professionals and patients using the Internet of Things (IoT) platform that retrieves data from the cloud. The evaluation results show better accuracy, i.e. 97.9% using the decision tree classifier. An experimental trial is carried out and the timing of 49 seconds is reached between BP measurement and the display of data on the IoT platform. Besides, the system was tested in real-time trials and produced an accurate classification of each measured BP. The obtained results approve the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of BP measurement, analysis, transmission, and supervision in real-time. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Today’s healthcare industry uses various technologies such as internet of things (IoT), blockchain and machine learning (ML) for its efficient and secure operation. With the advancements and increased research in IoT, many wearable devices (WD) are being used by the people to track the health issues. Large amount of data is collected by these devices and there has to be a suitable technology to securely store this information. Blockchain is an emerging technology that can be used for secured storage of healthcare records. Many features of blockchain such as immutability, distributed nature and integrity make it appropriate for healthcare industry. Blockchain can be applied in various grounds of healthcare industry such as remote patient monitoring, tele-surgeries, maintaining electronic health records (EHRs), clinical trials and medical research and pharmaceutical supply chain management. Privacy and security of data are assured when blockchain is integrated with healthcare system. When the number of users using smart devices expands, the network must be capable to handle huge amount of data in various types and sizes. The prevailing communication technologies fail to fulfil the intricate and dynamic needs of smart healthcare system (SHS). On the mission of developing communication technologies, 5G is expected to cater the needs of smart healthcare applications with its broad set of salient features and advanced design. The future smart healthcare systems are expected to be a mixture of the 5G, smart IoT devices and blockchain technology. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2022.

AB  - Arterial hypertension (HT) is a chronic condition of elevated blood pressure (BP), which may cause increased incidence of cardiovascular disease, stroke, kidney failure and mortality. If the HT is diagnosed early, effective treatment can control the BP and avert adverse outcomes. Physiological signals like electrocardiography (ECG), photoplethysmography (PPG), heart rate variability (HRV), and ballistocardiography (BCG) can be used to monitor health status but are not directly correlated with BP measurements. The manual detection of HT using these physiological signals is time consuming and prone to human errors. Hence, many computer-aided diagnosis systems have been developed. This paper is a systematic review of studies conducted on the automated detection of HT using ECG, HRV, PPG and BCG signals. In this review, we have identified 23 studies out of 250 screened papers, which fulfilled our eligibility criteria. Details of the study methods, physiological signal studied, database used, various nonlinear techniques employed, feature extraction, and diagnostic performance parameters are discussed. The machine learning and deep learning based methods based on ECG and HRV signals have yielded the best performance and can be used for the development of computer-aided diagnosis of HT. This work provides insights that may be useful for the development of wearable for continuous cuffless remote monitoring of BP based on ECG and HRV signals. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Health sector is a life critical domain, which requires fast and intelligent decisions. Artificial intelligence-based monitoring systems can help the elderly people in situations like fall. In e-health, systems are equipped with wearable devices that aid in remote monitoring with the help of Internet of Things (IoT). Our proposed work ensures fall detection using a three-layer architecture (Edge-Fog-Cloud) which takes advantage of the available smart devices. The edge detection involves vision-based detection using a compressed neural network running on a smart device constructed using transfer learning. Decision making in fog involves ensemble learning methodology using sensor-based data and decision from the edge. The cloud is used for permanent storage and model building. The work also takes advantage of image augmentation for data set building to improve the performance of the model. The model is evaluated based on accuracy, and the advantage of the fog layer is evaluated based on the latency. The proposed model gives an accuracy of 98.5% which is compared with the existing state-of-the-art algorithms available for detection.  © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Healthcare systems recognize and are trying to alleviate a common and rapidly growing psychological illness called stress. Stress detection is becoming the most valuable task of the healthcare industry. Thus, much research is being conducted in this domain. With the wide use of chest- and wrist-worn devices as part of the smart healthcare system utilizing emerging information technologies such as big data, the Internet of Things, and artificial intelligence, it is becoming easier to collect the relevant data and to interpret them correctly. This research aimed to evaluate and analyze the popular stress detection dataset Wearable Stress and Affect Detection (WESAD) using the RandOm Convolutional KErnel Transform (ROCKET) technique. Such technique was selected due to its ability to extract multiple features for the classification process without losing important data. The classification process utilizes the linear ridge classifier, and the results obtained from the use of the ROCKET technique in this study were compared to the previously published results of the successfully performed previous studies in this domain. The ROCKET technique showed satisfactory performance with 87% accuracy, close to and within the range of the results obtained from the algorithms that were previously applied on the WESAD dataset. The study results show the great potential of the ROCKET technique, which can be further improved by utilizing different existing classifiers or by proposing new models based on ridge or logistic regression. © 2021, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals.

AB  - WBAN (Wireless Body Area Network) is a cutting-edge technique. The major goal of WBAN is to gather crucial physiological characteristics or signals from patients. In a WBAN, data classification is necessary. Data identification and classification is a tough and time-consuming task. If data is not detected early, it might be fatal. To address this issue, various machine learning methods are used for classification of data in WBAN. The major goal of this review article is to look at several WBAN classification algorithms and suggest one that can manage the variability of data in the healthcare. This publication is crucial in terms of pointing researchers in the right direction when it comes to data classification for healthcare monitoring, as well as an analysis and summary of the most recent work in the field. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 may deteriorate rapidly and therefore continuous monitoring is necessary. We conducted an observational study involving patients with mild COVID-19 to explore the potentials of wearable biosensors and machine learning-based analysis of physiology parameters to detect clinical deterioration. Thirty-four patients (median age: 32 years; male: 52.9%) with mild COVID-19 from Queen Mary Hospital were recruited. The mean National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) were 0.59 ± 0.7. 1231 manual measurement of physiology parameters were performed during hospital stay (median 15 days). Physiology parameters obtained from wearable biosensors correlated well with manual measurement including pulse rate (r = 0.96, p < 0.0001) and oxygen saturation (r = 0.87, p < 0.0001). A machine learning-derived index reflecting overall health status, Biovitals Index (BI), was generated by autonomous analysis of physiology parameters, symptoms, and other medical data. Daily BI was linearly associated with respiratory tract viral load (p < 0.0001) and NEWS2 (r = 0.75, p < 0.001). BI was superior to NEWS2 in predicting clinical worsening events (sensitivity 94.1% and specificity 88.9%) and prolonged hospitalization (sensitivity 66.7% and specificity 72.7%). Wearable biosensors coupled with machine learning-derived health index allowed automated detection of clinical deterioration. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has revolutionized the healthcare domain, with the introduction of remote real-time monitoring. This emerging technology has not only relieved the burden of hospital resources, but also paved the way for efficient monitoring and management of patients. According to World Health Organization (WHO), in Pakistan, cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are leading cause of deaths that amount to nearly 200,000 deaths annually. This results in high mortality rates all over Pakistan. To uplift the current architecture of healthcare in Pakistan, it is vital to develop a sustainable solution for continuous health monitoring and arrest anomalous physiological behavior before they become life-threatening. In the same pretext, this study proposes a working paper which aims to disseminate interim results of smart cardiac health monitoring using an amalgam of IoMT and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The primary objective of the proposed research is to integrate state-of-the-art ML classification algorithms to detect, in near real-time, abnormal human vitals like electrocardiogram(ECG), heart-rate(HR), blood pressure(BP), etc. As network latency is critical to this application, therefore, to improve overall Quality of Service (QoS) of the system, we propose to fuse Edge Intelligence interfaced with multiple IoMT enabled bio-sensors. These sensors will form a body area sensor network(BSN) that records cardiac-related human vitals. In our preliminary research, that is presented in this paper, we trained several machine learning algorithms on the MIMIC-III clinical data-set and reviewed their performance. Among the 7 tested supervised classification algorithms, Random-Forest achieved the highest accuracy of 95% on the test set. Finally, to offer a remote patient management and monitoring panel, we developed an authenticated web-portal to inculcate data privacy and security in the proposed system.  © 2022 IEEE.

The application of artificial intelligence and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in electronic health (E-health) can efficiently promote the development of sustainable and smart cities. The IoT sensors and intelligent algorithms enable the remote monitoring and analyzing of the healthcare data of patients, which reduces the medical and travel expenses in cities. Existing deep learning-based methods for healthcare sensor data classification have made great achievements. However, these methods take much time and storage space for model training and inference. They are difficult to be deployed in small devices to classify the physiological signal of patients in real time. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a micro time series classification model called the micro neural network (MicroNN). The proposed model is micro enough to be deployed on tiny edge devices. MicroNN can be applied to long-term physiological signal monitoring based on edge computing devices. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the classification accuracy and computation complexity of MicroNN. Experiment results show that MicroNN performs better than the state-of-the-art methods. The accuracies on the two datasets (MIT-BIH-AR and INCART) are 98.4% and 98.1%, respectively. Finally, we present an application to show how MicroNN can improve the development of sustainable and smart cities.  © 2022 Jin Wu et al.

AB  - During the recent COVID-19 pandemic, Medical Body area networks (MBANs) emerged as an essential tool for the early diagnosis and treatment of infected patients. MBANs played an instrumental role in the remote treatment of COVID patients through early diagnosis using machine learning and IoT (Internet of Things). MBANs have paved their way in the health care industry and are being used in remote monitoring, emergency handling, and elderly assistance. The availability of the IEEE 802.15.6 standard has opened doors for new wearable consumer devices and IoMT (Internet of Medical Things) enabled applications to facilitate disease management. This standard was developed for wireless communication at a short-range, around the human body with low power requirements. This standard allows 2hop star topology within an intra-MBAN so that when direct communication is not possible, alternate routes are available through relays. This paper proposes a protocol for an intra-MBAN topology, which is a novel T-Relay mechanism that implements the 2-hop star topology. To validate the proposed protocol, it was tested on OMNeT ++ framework with Castalia Simulator for various scenarios. The simulation results show that the T-Relay mechanism enhances the PDR when the channel has variations.  © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Respiration rate is a vital parameter which is useful for the earlier identification of diseases. In this context, various types of devices have been fabricated and developed to monitor different breath rates. However, the disposability and biocompatibility of such sensors and the poor classification of different breath rates from sensor data are significant issues in medical services. This report attempts to focus on two important things: the classification of respiration signals from sensor data using deep learning and the disposability of devices. The use of the novel Janus MoSSe quantum dot (MoSSe QD) structure allows for stable respiration sensing because of unchanged wear rates under humid conditions, and also, the electron affinity and work function values suggest that MoSSe has a higher tendency to donate electrons and interact with the hydrogen molecule. Furthermore, for the real-time classification of different respiration signals, a 1D convolutional neural network (1D CNN) was incorporated. This algorithm was applied to four different breath patterns which achieved a state-of-the-art 10-trial accuracy of 98.18% for normal, 95.25% for slow, 97.64% for deep, and 98.18% for fast breaths. The successful demonstration of a stable, low-cost, and disposable respiration sensor with a highly accurate classification of signals is a major step ahead in developing wearable respiration sensors for future personal healthcare monitoring systems. © 2021 Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The Development of various flexible and stretchable materials has drawn interest for promising applications in the biomedical field, such as health care monitoring, artificial intelligence, wearable electronic skins. However, it's still challenging to achieve tunable sensitivity and stretchable property based on a particular application from large strain to minor strain. Herein, we present interconnected nanocomposite PANI-CNT impregnated in polyurethane polymer. Filler materials PANI are prepared by chemical oxidation method, and CNTs are surface modified by acid oxidation method. Nanocomposite was prepared by the solvent-casting method using polyurethane polymer. The subsequent change of electrical behavior was observed when the concentration of PANI increased in the nanocomposite. These prepared nanocomposites exhibited electrical conductivity and stretchability. Furthermore, nanocomposites are attached to the elbow and observe the change in bending movements of elbow. Altogether, prepared PANI-CNT/PU nanocomposite can be assembled as e-skins for various purposes such as healthcare, human motion monitoring and human-machine interface. © The Electrochemical Society

AB  - The Novel Corona Virus Disease-2019 (COVID-19), which created this pandemic, makes us realize the importance of universal social and health care systems. The frontline workers worked restlessly during the pandemic and few of them also lost their lives. There is a need for a remote IoT health monitoring system that takes care of the health of infected patients, conducts regular health checks, and reduces contact between an infected person and health workers. This especially helps the patients with mild symptoms who are home quarantined. The IoT system monitors a person 24/7 and a report can be generated and sent to the doctor at the same time. However, such a procedure will produce a large amount of data. A major research challenge addressed in this paper is to effectively transfer health care data with the help of existing network infrastructure and transfer it to the cloud. In this paper, we have identified the key network and infrastructure requirements for a standard health monitoring system based on real-time event updates, bandwidth requirements, data collection, and data analysis. After that, we propose IRHMP- IoT-based remote healthcare device that delivers health care data efficiently to the cloud and the web portal. Finally, we have proposed a machine-learning algorithm to provide and predict future health risks with the help of recorded data. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - A new computing paradigm that has been growing in computing systems is fog computing. In the healthcare industry, Internet of Things (IoT) driven fog computing is being developed to speed up the services for the general public and save billions of lives. This new computing platform, based on the fog computing paradigm, may reduce latency when transmitting and communicating signals with faraway servers, allowing medical services to be delivered more quickly in both spatial and temporal dimensions. One of the necessary qualities of computing systems that can enable the completion of healthcare operations is latency reduction. Fog computing can provide reduced latency when compared to cloud computing due to the use of only low-end computers, mobile phones, and personal devices in fog computing. In this paper, a new framework for healthcare monitoring for managing real-Time notification based on fog computing has been proposed. The proposed system monitors the patient's body temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure values obtained from the sensors that are embedded into a wearable device and notifies the doctors or caregivers in real time if there occur any contradictions in the normal threshold value using the machine learning algorithms. The notification can also be set for the patients to alert them about the periodical medications or diet to be maintained by the patients. The cloud layer stores the big data into the cloud for future references for the hospitals and the researchers. © 2022 Ahmed Elhadad et al.

AB  - Following the standardization and deployment of the 5G network, researchers have shifted their focus to beyond 5G (B5G) communication. Existing technologies have brought forth a plethora of applications that could not have been imagined in the past years. B5G will enable us to rethink the capability it will offer in various sectors, including agriculture, search and rescue, and, more specifically, in the delivery of health-care services. Unobtrusive and noninvasive measurements using radio-frequency (RF) sensing, monitoring, and the control of wearable medical devices are the areas that would potentially benefit from B5G. Applications such as RF sensing, device charging, and remote patient monitoring will be a key challenge in using millimeter-wave (mm-wave) communication. The mm-waves experience multipath-induced fading, where the rate of attenuation is larger as compared to microwaves. Eventually, mm-wave communication systems would require range extenders and guided surfaces. A proposed solution is the use of intelligent reflective surfaces, which will have the ability to manipulate electromagnetic (EM) signals. These intelligent surfaces mounted and/or coated on walls, also known as intelligent walls (IWs), are planar and active surfaces, which will be a key element in B5G and 6G communication. These intelligent walls, equipped with a machine learning (ML) algorithm and computation power, would have the ability to manipulate EM waves and act as gateways in the heterogeneous network environment. The article presents the application and vision of intelligent walls for next-generation health care in the era of B5G.  © 1990-2011 IEEE.

AB  - It is a major challenge in clinical epilepsy to diagnose and treat a disease characterized by infrequent seizures based on patient or caregiver reports and limited duration clinical testing. The poor reliability of self-reported seizure diaries for many people with epilepsy is well-established, but these records remain necessary in clinical care and therapeutic studies. A number of wearable devices have emerged, which may be capable of detecting seizures, recording seizure data, and alerting caregivers. Developments in non-invasive wearable sensors to measure accelerometry, photoplethysmography (PPG), electrodermal activity (EDA), electromyography (EMG), and other signals outside of the traditional clinical environment may be able to identify seizure-related changes. Non-invasive scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and minimally invasive subscalp EEG may allow direct measurement of seizure activity. However, significant network and computational infrastructure is needed for continuous, secure transmission of data. The large volume of data acquired by these devices necessitates computer-assisted review and detection to reduce the burden on human reviewers. Furthermore, user acceptability of such devices must be a paramount consideration to ensure adherence with long-term device use. Such devices can identify tonic–clonic seizures, but identification of other seizure semiologies with non-EEG wearables is an ongoing challenge. Identification of electrographic seizures with subscalp EEG systems has recently been demonstrated over long (>6 month) durations, and this shows promise for accurate, objective seizure records. While the ability to detect and forecast seizures from ambulatory intracranial EEG is established, invasive devices may not be acceptable for many individuals with epilepsy. Recent studies show promising results for probabilistic forecasts of seizure risk from long-term wearable devices and electronic diaries of self-reported seizures. There may also be predictive value in individuals' symptoms, mood, and cognitive performance. However, seizure forecasting requires perpetual use of a device for monitoring, increasing the importance of the system's acceptability to users. Furthermore, long-term studies with concurrent EEG confirmation are lacking currently. This review describes the current evidence and challenges in the use of minimally and non-invasive devices for long-term epilepsy monitoring, the essential components in remote monitoring systems, and explores the feasibility to detect and forecast impending seizures via long-term use of these systems. © Copyright © 2021 Brinkmann, Karoly, Nurse, Dumanis, Nasseri, Viana, Schulze-Bonhage, Freestone, Worrell, Richardson and Cook.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc globally and still persists even after a year of its initial outbreak. Several reasons can be considered: people are in close contact with each other, i.e., at a short range (1 m), and the healthcare system is not sufficiently developed or does not have enough facilities to manage and fight the pandemic, even in developed countries such as the USA and the U.K. and countries in Europe. There is a great need in healthcare for remote monitoring of COVID-19 symptoms. In the past year, a number of IoT-based devices and wearables have been introduced by researchers, providing good results in terms of high accuracy in diagnosing patients in the prodromal phase and in monitoring the symptoms of patients, i.e., respiratory rate, heart rate, temperature, etc. In this systematic review, we analyzed these wearables and their need in the healthcare system. The research was conducted using three databases: IEEE Xplore®, Web of Science®, and PubMed Central®, between December 2019 and June 2021. This article was based on the PRISMA guidelines. Initially, 1100 articles were identified while searching the scientific literature regarding this topic. After screening, ultimately, 70 articles were fully evaluated and included in this review. These articles were divided into two categories. The first one belongs to the on-body sensors (wearables), their types and positions, and the use of AI technology with ehealth wearables in different scenarios from screening to contact tracing. In the second category, we discuss the problems and solutions with respect to utilizing these wearables globally. This systematic review provides an extensive overview of wearable systems for the remote management and automated assessment of COVID-19, taking into account the reliability and acceptability of the implemented technologies. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Flexible, breathable, and degradable pressure sensors with excellent sensing performance are drawing tremendous attention for various practical applications in wearable artificial skins, healthcare monitoring, and artificial intelligence due to their flexibility, breathability, lightweight, decreased electronic rubbish, and environmentally friendly impact. However, traditional plastic or elastomer substrates with impermeability, uncomfortableness, mechanical mismatches, and nondegradability greatly restricted their practical applications. Therefore, the fabrication of such pressure sensors with high flexibility, facile degradability, and breathability is still a critical challenge and highly desired. Herein, we present a wearable, breathable, degradable, and highly sensitive MXene/protein nanocomposites-based pressure sensor. The fabricated MXene/protein-based pressure sensor is assembled from a breathable conductive MXene coated silk fibroin nanofiber (MXene-SF) membrane and a silk fibroin nanofiber membrane patterned with a MXene ink-printed (MXene ink-SF) interdigitated electrode, which can serve as the sensing layer and the electrode layer, respectively. The assembled pressure sensor exhibits a wide sensing range (up to 39.3 kPa), high sensitivity (298.4 kPa-1 for 1.4-15.7 kPa; 171.9 kPa-1 for 15.7-39.3 kPa), fast response/recovery time (7/16 ms), reliable breathability, excellent cycling stability over 10 »000 cycles, good biocompatibility, and robust degradability. Furthermore, it shows great sensing performance in monitoring human psychological signals, acting as an artificial skin for the quantitative illustration of pressure distribution, and wireless biomonitoring in real time. Considering the biodegradable and breathable features, the sensor may become promising to find potential applications in smart electronic skins, human motion detection, disease diagnosis, and human-machine interaction.  ©

AB  - Background: Over recent years, interest in the development of smart health technologies aimed at supporting independent living for older populations has increased. The integration of innovative technologies, such as the Internet of Things, wearable technologies, artificial intelligence, and ambient-assisted living applications, represents a valuable solution for this scope. Designing such an integrated system requires addressing several aspects (eg, equipment selection, data management, analytics, costs, and users'needs) and involving different areas of expertise (eg, medical science, service design, biomedical and computer engineering). Objective: The objective of this study is 2-fold; we aimed to design the functionalities of a smart health platform addressing 5 chronic conditions prevalent in the older population (ie, hearing loss, cardiovascular diseases, cognitive impairments, mental health problems, and balance disorders) by considering both older adults'and clinicians' perspectives and to evaluate the identified smart health platform functionalities with a small group of older adults. Methods: Overall, 24 older adults (aged >65 years) and 118 clinicians were interviewed through focus group activities and web-based questionnaires to elicit the smart health platform requirements. Considering the elicited requirements, the main functionalities of smart health platform were designed. Then, a focus group involving 6 older adults was conducted to evaluate the proposed solution in terms of usefulness, credibility, desirability, and learnability. Results: Eight main functionalities were identified and assessed-cognitive training and hearing training (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 6/6, 100%; learnability: 6/6, 100%), monitoring of physiological parameters (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 6/6, 100%; learnability: 5/6, 83%), physical training (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 5/6, 83%; learnability: 2/6, 33%), psychoeducational intervention (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 4/6, 67%; learnability: 2/6, 33%), mood monitoring (usefulness: 4/6, 67%; credibility: 4/6, 67%; desirability: 3/6, 50%; learnability: 5/6, 50%), diet plan (usefulness: 5/6, 83%; credibility: 4/6, 67%; desirability: 1/6, 17%; learnability: 2/6, 33%), and environment monitoring and adjustment (usefulness: 1/6, 17%; credibility: 1/6, 17%; desirability: 0/6, 0%; learnability: 0/6, 0%). Most of them were highly appreciated by older participants, with the only exception being environment monitoring and adjustment. The results showed that the proposed functionalities met the needs and expectations of users (eg, improved self-management of patients' disease and enhanced patient safety). However, some aspects need to be addressed (eg, technical and privacy issues). Conclusions: The presented smart health platform functionalities seem to be able to meet older adults' needs and desires to enhance their self-awareness and self-management of their medical condition, encourage healthy and independent living, and provide evidence-based support for clinicians' decision-making. Further research with a larger and more heterogeneous pool of stakeholders in terms of demographics and clinical conditions is needed to assess system acceptability and overall user experience in free-living conditions. © 2022 JMIR Publications Inc..

AB  - Background: Since the original application of NIRS to study the bladder, a series of advances have enabled the urologic system to be more comprehensively studied, and range of devices now provide previously unavailable physiologic measurements. As in other fields, this evolution follows progressive improvements in the technology, the availability of new components and materials, and construct of novel software and algorithms. Methods: Review of the literature describing NIRS monitoring of the urologic system (bladder, pelvic floor, urinary sphincter, brain). Results: The advent of lasers and development of fiberoptics established NIRS as a viable entity, and allowed transcutaneous monitoring of physiologic changes in the bladder detrusor muscle during spontaneous voiding. Small light emitting diodes which traded depth of penetration for portability led to wearable devices when combined with wireless capability; emitter and photodiode refinement, spatially resolved geometry, and software and algorithm development spawned the current generation of compact, robust multipotential devices, including a transvaginal interface able to quantify reoxygenation recovery in pelvic floor muscles, and interrogate the urinary sphincter. Functional NIRS allows brain mediated neural activity linked to bladder sensation and control of voiding to be mapped in real time during evaluation of voiding dysfunction; simultaneous fNIRS during fMRI is also feasible. Wearable devices linked to wireless peripherals enable serial monitoring at home of voiding parameters once only available in the hospital setting; exploration of artificial intelligence will further expand the urologic relevance of NIRS. Conclusions: The technological advances evident in urologic applications of NIRS mirror those occurring in other fields.  © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

AB  - Parkinson’s disease medication treatment planning is generally based on subjective data obtained through clinical, physician-patient interactions. The Personal KinetiGraph™ (PKG) and similar wearable sensors have shown promise in enabling objective, continuous remote health monitoring for Parkinson’s patients. In this proof-of-concept study, we propose to use objective sensor data from the PKG and apply machine learning to cluster patients based on levodopa regimens and response. The resulting clusters are then used to enhance treatment planning by providing improved initial treatment estimates to supplement a physician’s initial assessment. We apply kmeans clustering to a dataset of within-subject Parkinson’s medication changes—clinically assessed by the MDS-Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale-III (MDS-UPDRS-III) and the PKG sensor for movement staging. A random forest classification model was then used to predict patients’ cluster allocation based on their respective demographic information, MDS-UPDRS-III scores, and PKG time-series data. Clinically relevant clusters were partitioned by levodopa dose, medication administration frequency, and total levodopa equivalent daily dose—with the PKG providing similar symptomatic assessments to physician MDS-UPDRS-III scores. A random forest classifier trained on demographic information, MDS-UPDRS-III scores, and PKG time-series data was able to accurately classify subjects of the two most demographically similar clusters with an accuracy of 86.9%, an F1 score of 90.7%, and an AUC of 0.871. A model that relied solely on demographic information and PKG time-series data provided the next best performance with an accuracy of 83.8%, an F1 score of 88.5%, and an AUC of 0.831, hence further enabling fully remote assessments. These computational methods demonstrate the feasibility of using sensor-based data to cluster patients based on their medication responses with further potential to assist with medication recommendations. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Objective: We developed a wearable watch-based device to provide noninvasive, cuff-less blood pressure (BP) estimation in an at-home setting. Methods: The watch measures single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), tri-axial seismocardiogram (SCG), and multi-wavelength photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals to compute the pulse transit time (PTT), allowing for BP estimation. We sent our custom watch device and an oscillometric BP cuff home with 21 healthy subjects, and captured the natural variability in BP over the course of a 24-hour period. Results: After calibration, our Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.69 and root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of 2.72 mmHg suggest that noninvasive PTT measurements correlate with around-the-clock BP. Using a novel two-point calibration method, we achieved a RMSE of 3.86 mmHg. We further demonstrated the potential of a semi-globalized adaptive model to reduce calibration requirements. Conclusion: This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first time that BP has been comprehensively estimated noninvasively using PTT in an at-home setting. We showed a more convenient method for obtaining ambulatory BP than through the use of the standard oscillometric cuff. We presented new calibration methods for BP estimation using fewer calibration points that are more practical for a real-world scenario. Significance: A custom watch (SeismoWatch) capable of taking multiple BP measurements enables reliable remote monitoring of daily BP and paves the way towards convenient hypertension screening and management, which can potentially reduce hospitalizations and improve quality of life.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Epitel has developed Epilog, a miniature, wireless, wearable electroencephalography (EEG) sensor. Four Epilog sensors are combined as part of Epitel's Remote EEG Monitoring platform (REMI) to create 10 channels of EEG for remote patient monitoring. REMI is designed to provide comprehensive spatial EEG recordings that can be administered by non-specialized medical personnel in any medical center. The purpose of this study was to determine how accurate epileptologists are at remotely reviewing Epilog sensor EEG in the 10-channel “REMI montage,” with and without seizure detection support software. Three board certified epileptologists reviewed the REMI montage from 20 subjects who wore four Epilog sensors for up to 5 days alongside traditional video-EEG in the EMU, 10 of whom experienced a total of 24 focal-onset electrographic seizures and 10 of whom experienced no seizures or epileptiform activity. Epileptologists randomly reviewed the same datasets with and without clinical decision support annotations from an automated seizure detection algorithm tuned to be highly sensitive. Blinded consensus review of unannotated Epilog EEG in the REMI montage detected people who were experiencing electrographic seizure activity with 90% sensitivity and 90% specificity. Consensus detection of individual focal onset seizures resulted in a mean sensitivity of 61%, precision of 80%, and false detection rate (FDR) of 0.002 false positives per hour (FP/h) of data. With algorithm seizure detection annotations, the consensus review mean sensitivity improved to 68% with a slight increase in FDR (0.005 FP/h). As seizure detection software, the automated algorithm detected people who were experiencing electrographic seizure activity with 100% sensitivity and 70% specificity, and detected individual focal onset seizures with a mean sensitivity of 90% and mean false alarm rate of 0.087 FP/h. This is the first study showing epileptologists' ability to blindly review EEG from four Epilog sensors in the REMI montage, and the results demonstrate the clinical potential to accurately identify patients experiencing electrographic seizures. Additionally, the automated algorithm shows promise as clinical decision support software to detect discrete electrographic seizures in individual records as accurately as FDA-cleared predicates. © Copyright © 2021 Frankel, Lehmkuhle, Spitz, Newman, Richards and Arain.

AB  - Flexible and wearable pressure sensors have gained great popularity in consumer electronics due to their potential applications in human healthcare, E-skin, and artificial intelligence interactions. MXene is regarded as one of the most ideal candidate sensing materials due to its high electrical conductivity and controllable interlayer space. However, the easy-to-oxidize characteristic of MXene materials greatly restricts the sensitivity and reliability of sensor devices, especially in wet climates. Herein, a highly sensitive and waterproof flexible pressure sensor using a free-standing hydrophobic bacterial cellulose/Ti3C2Tx MXene (HBT) hybrid film as a sensing layer is fabricated by facile and effective nanocellulose intercalation and fluorine modification strategies. The obtained pressure sensor delivers high sensitivity (65.5 kPa-1), fast response (50 ms), wide linear sensing range (0.002-30 kPa) with a low detection limit of 0.57 Pa, and excellent repeatability over 50,000 cycles. Meanwhile, owing to the highly hydrophobic surface of the HTB film, the outstanding sensing features could be well retained, although immersed in water several times. Benefiting from the excellent sensing properties and water resistance, the HBT sensor serves as a wearable force sensor to monitor the full-range human physiological motions regardless of whether the conditions are normal or wet. This work provides a new pathway to design the MXene pressure sensor with high reliability and demonstrates the promising usage of HBT sensors in portable biomedical electronics. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Sensor-based human activity recognition (S-HAR) has become an important and high-impact topic of research within human-centered computing. In the last decade, successful applications of S-HAR have been presented through fruitful academic research and industrial applications, including for healthcare monitoring, smart home controlling, and daily sport tracking. However, the growing requirements of many current applications for recognizing complex human activities (CHA) have begun to attract the attention of the HAR research field when compared with simple human activities (SHA). S-HAR has shown that deep learning (DL), a type of machine learning based on complicated artificial neural networks, has a significant degree of recognition efficiency. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are two different types of DL methods that have been successfully applied to the S-HAR challenge in recent years. In this paper, we focused on four RNN-based DL models (LSTMs, BiLSTMs, GRUs, and BiGRUs) that performed complex activity recognition tasks. The efficiency of four hybrid DL models that combine convolutional layers with the efficient RNN-based models was also studied. Experimental studies on the UTwente dataset demonstrated that the suggested hybrid RNN-based models achieved a high level of recognition performance along with a variety of performance indicators, including accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix. The experimental results show that the hybrid DL model called CNN-BiGRU outperformed the other DL models with a high accuracy of 98.89% when using only complex activity data. Moreover, the CNN-BiGRU model also achieved the highest recognition performance in other scenarios (99.44% by using only simple activity data and 98.78% with a combination of simple and complex activities). © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Nowadays, wearable technology represents a valid, autonomous and non-invasive instrument to capture, analyze and collect physiological data. Several time series signals, such as electrocardiographic or electromyographic signals, can, in fact, be acquired anytime and anywhere, providing the least possible discomfort to the patient, thanks to the continuous development of increasingly advanced devices. While the unceasing acquisition of data contributes to the improvement of the patient care process, the sheer volume of the resulting data makes the analysis and processing of such data difficult and particularly burdensome. The integration of wearable sensors with Artificial Intelligence contributes to the realization of faster, more easily applied and more cost-effective solutions aimed at improving early diagnosis, personalized treatment, remote patient monitoring and better decision making with a consequent reduction in healthcare costs. The increase in the use and application of these techniques, together with the continuous development of new models, raises the question of which technique is the most reliable and accurate in the analysis of such data, in addition to rendering the information explainable and understandable. The black box nature of many algorithms has, in fact, reduced their application in some sectors, such as healthcare, where the understandability and explainability of the results obtained are necessary in order to gain the trust of medical experts and patients. This chapter presents an overview of the main Artificial Intelligence models used for time series data analysis, highlighting the main characteristics of each. The aim is to provide researchers with an panoramic that can guide them in choosing the most suitable technique for their studies. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have been significant contributors to the development of sophisticated systems and models for cardiovascular disease (CVD) management. There is a wide scope of applications available today. Electrocardiography (ECG), cardiovascular image analysis and wearables for remote monitoring are the most consistently developing domains that are beginning to be AI-driven as technology and software advance over time. Furthermore, throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, AI has been utilised for cardiovascular disease management, drug targeting and risk analysis. The aim of the review is to highlight the recent advancements related to CVD management using AI and ML-based technologies. The works of literature reviewed in the present study consider the advancements of AI and ML-based CVD management technologies developed in the past decade. The different methods and technologies were studied, the working of various AI and ML algorithms have been discussed and few research gaps have been identified. The current implementations of AI algorithms lay a foundation to reduce the time and effort required to develop newer systems for future developments. Subsequently, overcoming the limitations of data processing techniques, many parameters required, and standardized datasets will improve the accuracy, implementation and interoperability of the AI and ML-based technologies for seamless integration in healthcare.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - As COVID-19 hounds the world, the common cause of finding a swift solution to manage the pandemic has brought together researchers, institutions, governments, and society at large. The Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI) - including machine learning (ML) and Big Data analytics - as well as Robotics and Blockchain, are the four decisive areas of technological innovation that have been ingenuity harnessed to fight this pandemic and future ones. While these highly interrelated smart and connected health technologies cannot resolve the pandemic overnight and may not be the only answer to the crisis, they can provide greater insight into the disease and support frontline efforts to prevent and control the pandemic. This article provides a blend of discussions on the contribution of these digital technologies, propose several complementary and multidisciplinary techniques to combat COVID-19, offer opportunities for more holistic studies, and accelerate knowledge acquisition and scientific discoveries in pandemic research. First, four areas, where IoT can contribute are discussed, namely: 1) tracking and tracing; 2) remote patient monitoring (RPM) by wearable IoT (WIoT); 3) personal digital twins (PDTs); and 4) real-life use case: ICT/IoT solution in South Korea. Second, the role and novel applications of AI are explained, namely: 1) diagnosis and prognosis; 2) risk prediction; 3) vaccine and drug development; 4) research data set; 5) early warnings and alerts; 6) social control and fake news detection; and 7) communication and chatbot. Third, the main uses of robotics and drone technology are analyzed, including: 1) crowd surveillance; 2) public announcements; 3) screening and diagnosis; and 4) essential supply delivery. Finally, we discuss how distributed ledger technologies (DLTs), of which blockchain is a common example, can be combined with other technologies for tackling COVID-19. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Gait evaluation is important for apprehension and management of different neurocognitive disorders (NCD). The gait events are changing with the age factor and this variability is being incorrectly linked with people with NCD. So, there is a high need to analyze gait events correctly. The gait analysis is mostly performed on temporal and spectral feature extraction in which there is a high rate of missing important features. Apart from this, monitoring and quantification of Parkinson's disease patients raise many therapeutic challenges in terms of severity analysis of motor symptoms i.e. freezing of gait (FOG), bradykinesia and continuous remote monitoring of patients. The objective of this study is to use a smart insole dataset for the assessment of computational techniques focusing on gait evaluation. The objective of this research study is to use continuous wavelet transform to convert time series signals into an images instead of using more traditional techniques for dealing with time series based on e.g. recurrent architectures. The results evidence that the proposed system works efficiently with the accuracy of 96.5% in gait variability analyzing three cohorts i.e. adults, elderly, and patients with Parkinson's disease (PwPD) and 91% for analyzing the gait symptoms in different severity stages of PD patients.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - With the rapid development of society in recent decades, the wearable sensor has attracted attention for motion-based health care and artificial applications. However, there are still many limitations to applying them in real life, particularly the inconvenience that comes from their large size and non-flexible systems. To solve these problems, flexible small-sized sensors that use body motion as a stimulus are studied to directly collect more accurate and diverse signals. In particular, tactile sensors are applied directly on the skin and provide input signals of motion change for the flexible reading device. This review provides information about different types of tactile sensors and their working mechanisms that are piezoresistive, piezocapacitive, piezoelectric, and triboelectric. More-over, this review presents not only the applications of the tactile sensor in motion sensing and health care monitoring, but also their contributions in the field of artificial intelligence in recent years. Other applications, such as human behavior studies, are also suggested. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Rationale, aims and objectives: Artificial intelligence and big data are more and more used in medicine, either in prevention, diagnosis or treatment, and are clearly modifying the way medicine is thought and practiced. Some authors argue that the use of artificial intelligence techniques to analyze big data would even constitute a scientific revolution, in medicine as much as in other scientific disciplines. Moreover, artificial intelligence techniques, coupled with mobile health technologies, could furnish a personalized medicine, adapted to the individuality of each patient. In this paper we argue that this conception is largely a myth: what health professionals and patients need is not more data, but data that are critically appraised, especially to avoid bias. Methods: In this historical and conceptual article, we focus on two main problems: first, the data and the problem of its validity; second, the inference drawn from the data by AI, and the establishment of correlations through the use of algorithms. We use examples from the contemporary use of mobile health (mHealth), i.e. the practice of medicine and public health supported by mobile or wearable devices such as mobile phones or smart watches. Results: We show that the validity of the data and of the inferences drawn from these mHealth data are likely to be biased. As biases are insensitive to the size of the sample, even if the sample is the whole population, artificial intelligence and big data cannot avoid biases and even tend to increase them. Conclusions: The large amount of data thus appears rather as a problem than a solution. What contemporary medicine needs is not more data or more algorithms, but a critical appraisal of the data and of the analysis of the data. Considering the history of epidemiology, we propose three research priorities concerning the use of artificial intelligence and big data in medicine. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Wearable technology has played an essential role in the Mobile Health (mHealth) sector for diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation of numerous diseases and disorders. One such neuro-degenerative disorder is Parkinson's Disease (PD). It is categorized by motor symptoms that affect a patient's motor skills and non-motor symptoms that affect the general health of a PD patient. The quality of life of a patient with PD is highly compromised. To date, there is no cure for the disease, but early intervention and assistive care can help a PD patient to perform daily activities with considerable ease. Many research works in PD management discuss the challenges that healthcare professionals face in the early detection and management of this disease. Sensor devices have been promising to overcome these challenges to a certain degree because of the low cost and accuracy in measurement, yielding precise conclusive results to detect, monitor, and manage PD. This paper presents a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) that provides an in-depth analysis of the PD symptoms, Motor and Non-Motor Symptoms (NMS), the current diagnosis and management techniques used and their efficacy. The paper also highlights the work of various researchers in wearable sensors and their proposals to improve the quality of life of a PD patient by diagnosing, monitoring, and managing PD symptoms remotely via wearable sensors. Another area of focus is commercially available wearables for PD management and a few promising works in progress. This paper will be beneficial for future researchers to identify existing gaps and provide the clinicians better insight into the disease progression, and avoid complications. This paper analyzes around 50+ articles from 2016 to 2021 and concludes that there is still much room for improvement in wearables for PD management during the research process. While much work has been attributed to PD Motor Symptom management, there is little focus on the management of PD NMS via wearable sensors. Furthermore, this paper also presents future work for PD management.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Telemedicine consists in the delivery of health care services, where patients and providers are separated by distance. Telemonitoring facilities play an important role in remote assistance programs, particularly in assisting patients suffering from chronic afflictions, such as phlebopathic diseases (e.g. chronic venous disease and diabetic foot). When these pathologies worsen, complications can be serious. In fact, foot deformities lead to variations of plantar load, formation of ulcers and, in the worst case, to amputation. Consequently, these pathologies cause huge expenses for the health care system. We propose a framework for screening and early detection of phlebopathic diseases insurgence, based on dynamic tests for functional assessment where patients wear sensorized socks. Socks used in this study integrate force and inertial sensors to provide information on plantar pressures and person's movement. We show results of a feasibility study including 42 patients, with a balance of 21 healthy patients and 21 with phlebopathic diseases. Data gathered from wearables were automatically elaborated through machine learning techniques in order to obtain a binary classifier identifying whether or not a patient shows pathological gait. Results show that our best classifier has high positive predictive value and high sensitivity, with F1-score equal to 92.1%. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Advances in healthcare systems are helpful in the diagnosis and treatment of extremely critical diseases. Continuous monitoring of individuals leads to huge amount of medical data, and new technology solutions are highly essential to handle the generated data. Fog computing approach is proposed in this chapter to develop an efficient wearable device for wireless healthcare monitoring. Fog computing proves to be better than other remote health monitoring methods because of its fast decision-making capability and delivery of simple notifications to users. Centralized cloud server is utilized in fog computing framework for performing complex computations. In this work, machine learning-based Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) risk detection is carried out with fog manipulation technique. Machine learningbased CHD risk assessment is performed on HRV feature-extracted ECG signal, blood pressure, glucose and cholesterol level. Wavelets are applied in this work for ECG signal feature extraction and identifying heart rate-related parameters. Various machine learning algorithms such as decision tree classifier, SVM, ANFIS and KNN are utilized for classification. ANFIS classification is found to be effective in CHD risk prediction; it categorizes the given individual data into normal and CHD risky.

AB  - The rapid growth of smart wearables and body sensor networks is expected to increase over the years. The reducing cost of manufacturing, deployment and the small and unobtrusive nature of most of the wearables available have intensified the acceptability for deployment in areas such as medical devices for healthcare monitoring. This work explored the use of artificial intelligence to enhance authentication of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) through a design of a framework. The framework is designed using wearable and or with a mobile device for extracting bioelectrical signals and context awareness data. The framework uses bioelectrical signals for authentication while artificial intelligence is applied using the contextual data to enhance the patient data integrity. The framework applied different security levels to balance between usability and security on the bases of False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and False Rejection Rate (FRR). 30 people are used for the evaluation of the different security levels and the security level 1 achieved a result based on usability vs security obtaining FAR of 5.6% and FRR of 9% but when the FAR is at 0% the FRR stood at 29%. The Intelligent Authentication Framework for Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) will be of advantage in increasing the trust of data extracted for the purpose of user authentication by reducing the FRR percentage. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - In medical practices, the detection of diseases highly depends on different medical tests. Electrocardiogram (ECG) technique is commonly used for heart disease diagnosis. Doctors can measure pulse and other heart boundaries with the aid of it. Fast and precise detection of forms of arrhythmia is critical while identifying heart disease. In this work, we proposed an intelligent ECG device (called iKardo) with the built-in automatic capability to classify into critical and non-critical data from an imbalanced ECG dataset for the smart IoT or Internet of Things based smart healthcare device. Particular emphasis is given to the reduction of data misclassification by converting imbalanced data into a balanced dataset using necessary techniques. This proposed iKardo helps in the accurate detection of critical ECG beats with an accuracy of 99.58% and result in a smart healthcare monitoring device that would make the disease detection fast and precise.  © 1975-2011 IEEE.

AB  - A novel coronavirus (CoV) is a coronavirus strain that hasn't been seen before. Coronavirus infection 2019 refers to a sickness caused by a single coronavirus that Wuhan, China, was the first discovery site. (COVID-19). The COVID-19 virus could be a one-of-a-kind virus related to respiratory disorders and various common colds. Direct contact with an inflamed person's respiratory droplets (which can be formed by coughing and sneezing) and contacting virus-infested surfaces are also ways for the virus to spread. The COVID-19 virus can survive for hours on end on surfaces. A variety of physiological changes are linked to COVID-19 and other viral diseases, which can be monitored with the help of wearable sensors. Heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), RHR, and RR should be used as potential markers of COVID-19 infection. Additional changes to ECG waveforms should include data indicating the occurrence of infection. Stress, recovery, exercise, and sleep are just a few of the more complicated metrics that may be tracked by many wearables. These metrics are often derived by combining cardiac and accelerometer data. Since numerous observations are combined into one, these metrics should have a larger SNR and consequently a higher predictive value than raw signals alone. A significant frequency of fever and metabolic symptoms in COVID19 necessitates monitoring of core temperature and blood vessel O saturation (SpO2). Mobile business devices don't typically take these kinds of measurements these days. As countries seek to expand testing, testing solutions must be both technically sound practical and user-friendly. Nucleic acid and antibody testing are two types of in vitro diagnostic (IVD) test that employ biological materials such as blood to detect the RNA of the virus and the antibodies the body has produced in reaction to the virus. In addition to chest radiography and computed tomography machines, there are also deep learning detection methods and portable devices.

AB  - Background: The ubiquity of mobile phones and increasing use of wearable fitness trackers offer a wide-ranging window into people's health and well-being. There are clear advantages in using remote monitoring technologies to gain an insight into health, particularly under the shadow of the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective: Covid Collab is a crowdsourced study that was set up to investigate the feasibility of identifying, monitoring, and understanding the stratification of SARS-CoV-2 infection and recovery through remote monitoring technologies. Additionally, we will assess the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated social measures on people's behavior, physical health, and mental well-being. Methods: Participants will remotely enroll in the study through the Mass Science app to donate historic and prospective mobile phone data, fitness tracking wearable data, and regular COVID-19-related and mental health-related survey data. The data collection period will cover a continuous period (ie, both before and after any reported infections), so that comparisons to a participant's own baseline can be made. We plan to carry out analyses in several areas, which will cover symptomatology; risk factors; the machine learning-based classification of illness; and trajectories of recovery, mental well-being, and activity. Results: As of June 2021, there are over 17,000 participants-largely from the United Kingdom-and enrollment is ongoing. Conclusions: This paper introduces a crowdsourced study that will include remotely enrolled participants to record mobile health data throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The data collected may help researchers investigate a variety of areas, including COVID-19 progression; mental well-being during the pandemic; and the adherence of remote, digitally enrolled participants. © Callum Stewart, Yatharth Ranjan, Pauline Conde, Zulqarnain Rashid, Heet Sankesara, Xi Bai, Richard J B Dobson, Amos A Folarin.

AB  - Digital technologies have emerged in various dimensions of human life, ranging from education to professional services to wellbeing. In particular, health products and services have expanded by the use and development of artificial intelligence, mobile health applications, and wearable electronic devices. Such advancements have enabled accurate and updated tracking and modeling of health conditions. For instance, digital health technologies are capable of measuring environmental pollution and predicting its adverse health effects. Several health conditions, including chronic airway diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, can be exacerbated by pollution. These diseases impose substantial health burdens with high morbidity and mortality. Recently, efforts have been made to develop digital technologies to alleviate such conditions. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has facilitated the application of telemedicine and telemonitoring for patients with chronic airway diseases. This article reviews current trends and studies in digital technology utilization for investigating and managing environmental exposure and chronic airway diseases. First, we discussed the recent progression of digital technologies in general environmental healthcare. Then, we summarized the capacity of digital technologies in predicting exacerbation and self-management of airway diseases. Concluding these reviews, we provided suggestions to improve digital health technologies’ abilities to reduce the adverse effects of environmental exposure in chronic airway diseases, based on personal exposure-response modeling. © Yonsei University College of Medicine 2022.

AB  - Self-powered skin electronics capable of energy harvesting and health monitoring is being regarded as the next-generation wearable system, with broad applications both for academic research of artificial intelligence and clinical practice of healthcare medicine. Demonstrated examples of self-powered skin electronics involves various types of devices, associated with energy conversion from piezoelectricity, triboelectricity, biofuel cell, photovoltaics, and thermoelectricity into electrical power source. These systems are of particular interests because they can intimately conform to the surfaces of skin with great flexibility and stretchability, and serve as wearable electronics. In this context, intrinsically stretchable materials and advanced device designs are in development to establish functional, high-performance interfaces with the skin. This review summarizes the most recent advances in this field, with highlight on constituent materials, device configuration, system functionality and integration methods in the past 5 years. Besides, subsequent section includes the related applications of these electronic platforms, with emphasis on energy harvesting and healthcare for human body and animal models. Toward the end of the article, the challenges and opportunities for self-powered skin electronics are discussed, offering information and research ideas for readers. These advances establish the foundations for self-powered devices in electrical skin interfaces of the future, where these advanced technologies suggest broad relevance to diverse skin-integrated electronics. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - As a result of the developments made in medical and technical aspects, the healthcare sector has been constantly evolving. Over the decades, healthcare has developed by using the best available PC technology. It has become an in-depth source of valuable analytical and analysis data. The health aspects of the person need to be monitored with the utmost concern and treated with appropriate medications. Proactive monitoring of one's health can cure and prevent several diseases. In recent decades, technology has evolved to its height due to the availability of many wearable devices and health tracking gadgets on the market. Expert doctors also find it difficult to estimate the disease from the symptoms seen from the diseased, but using advanced technical tools such as the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud/edge computing, machine learning and AI along with Big Data will make it much easier for doctors to dig out and describe the root cause of the disease and predict its severity using modern algorithms. The objective is to be able to extract relevant and important information from the massive data usually produced in IOT devices by the front-end sensor frameworks and few intelligences that could be included in the front-end module itself to allow the front-end to make a decision based on data priority. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Background: The number of solid organ transplants in Canada has increased 33% over the past decade. Hospital readmissions are common within the first year after transplant and are linked to increased morbidity and mortality. Nearly half of these admissions to the hospital appear to be preventable. Mobile health (mHealth) technologies hold promise to reduce admission to the hospital and improve patient outcomes, as they allow real-Time monitoring and timely clinical intervention. Objective: This study aims to determine whether an innovative mHealth intervention can reduce hospital readmission and unscheduled visits to the emergency department or transplant clinic. Our second objective is to assess the use of clinical and continuous ambulatory physiologic data to develop machine learning algorithms to predict the risk of infection, organ rejection, and early mortality in adult heart, kidney, and liver transplant recipients. Methods: Remote Mobile Outpatient Monitoring in Transplant (Reboot) 2.0 is a two-phased single-center study to be conducted at the University Health Network in Toronto, Canada. Phase one will consist of a 1-year concealed randomized controlled trial of 400 adult heart, kidney, and liver transplant recipients. Participants will be randomized to receive either personalized communication using an mHealth app in addition to standard of care phone communication (intervention group) or standard of care communication only (control group). In phase two, the prior collected data set will be used to develop machine learning algorithms to identify early markers of rejection, infection, and graft dysfunction posttransplantation. The primary outcome will be a composite of any unscheduled hospital admission, visits to the emergency department or transplant clinic, following discharge from the index admission. Secondary outcomes will include patient-reported outcomes using validated self-Administered questionnaires, 1-year graft survival rate, 1-year patient survival rate, and the number of standard of care phone voice messages. Results: At the time of this paper s completion, no results are available. Conclusions: Building from previous work, this project will aim to leverage an innovative mHealth app to improve outcomes and reduce hospital readmission in adult solid organ transplant recipients. Additionally, the development of machine learning algorithms to better predict adverse health outcomes will allow for personalized medicine to tailor clinician-patient interactions and mitigate the health care burden of a growing patient population. © 2021 JMIR Publications Inc.

AB  - The current pandemic and the expansion of insurance coverage of telehealth for the elderly has shown the need for improvements in the automation of medical services and behavioral monitoring. Elderly individuals at home or in senior centers typically contact their physicians once a serious medical condition is obvious. There are very few systems with automated means of monitoring the health of individuals recovering from an injury or monitoring their progress when conducting telerehabilitation using wearables, remote cameras, and the cloud. To address these automation and long-term health monitoring issues, we have developed a multi-modal platform that employs common, low-cost wearables, and teleconferencing tools that takes advantage of cloud streaming services. One modality is based on Visual IoT and edge devices that automatically connect as teleconferencing clients to record human subjects' telerehabilitation and teletreatment sessions and push these recordings to cloud storage. We performed experiments applying two different deep learning models to the cloud video streams to track whole-body skeleton motion or to detect hand keypoints during telerehabilitation. The rehabilitation maybe associated with recovery from a stroke or other similar incident. The other modality of our platform includes an Apple Watch ® App that pushes users' physiological and kinematic data to the cloud and automatically generates data analytics dashboards for use by clinicians. Both, the wearables-based and the Visual IoT-based modalities complement each other in telerehabilitation or teletreatment controlled by clinicians. These modalities can also work together in sessions without the need for controlled (uncontrolled) telemonitoring. Our multimodality, cloud-based architecture shows very promising applications in automatic behavioral analytics, especially for elderly individuals with limited social contact that would benefit from telerehabilitation, or continuous telemonitoring.  © 2021 TSI Enterprises.

AB  - With the rising amount of data in the sports and health sectors, a plethora of applications using big data mining have become possible. Multiple frameworks have been proposed to mine, store, preprocess, and analyze physiological vitals data using artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms. Comparatively, less research has been done to collect potentially high volume, high-quality ‘big data’ in an organized, time-synchronized, and holistic manner to solve similar problems in multiple fields. Although a large number of data collection devices exist in the form of sensors. They are either highly specialized, univariate and fragmented in nature or exist in a lab setting. The current study aims to propose artificial intelligence-based body sensor network framework (AIBSNF), a framework for strategic use of body sensor networks (BSN), which combines with real-time location system (RTLS) and wearable biosensors to collect multivariate, low noise, and high-fidelity data. This facilitates gathering of time-synchronized location and physiological vitals data, which allows artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML)-based time series analysis. The study gives a brief overview of wearable sensor technology, RTLS, and provides use cases of AI/ML algorithms in the field of sensor fusion. The study also elaborates sample scenarios using a specific sensor network consisting of pressure sensors (insoles), accelerometers, gyroscopes, ECG, EMG, and RTLS position detectors for particular applications in the field of health care and sports. The AIBSNF may provide a solid blueprint for conducting research and development, forming a smooth end-to-end pipeline from data collection using BSN, RTLS and final stage analytics based on AI/ML algorithms. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Obesity is a serious health problem that is on the rise at the global level. Recent studies suggest that BMI can be inferred from facial images using deep learning-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for obesity classification with about 85–90% accuracy. However, training and testing these deep learning models involves high computation and storage due to the involvement of millions of parameters. A recent trend is the use of lightweight CNN models to facilitate on-device computation in resource-constrained mobile and wearable devices. In this study, we evaluate several lightweight CNNs such as MobileNet-V2, ShuffleNet-V2, and lightCNN-29 for BMI prediction and obesity classification from facial images captured using smartphones. The comparative analysis is done with heavyweight VGG-16 and ResNet-50-based CNN models. These lightweight models when deployed on smartphones can act as self-diagnostic tool in weight changes and obesity monitoring. These tools can facilitate remote monitoring of patients, obtaining patients’ vital signs, and in improving the quality of care provided. Self-diagnostic tools would also help in keeping users’ health data private, safe, and secure. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Recently, human activity recognition (HAR) has gained a lot of importance due to its wide range of applications in virtual reality, healthcare, surveillance, security, automated control systems, etc. Latest mobile phones have advanced computational capabilities along with several embedded MEMS sensors, which enable us to detect various physical activities unobtrusively. Incorporating personalized motion samples can improve the accuracy of motion detection by mobile devices or wearable devices that are tailored to the individual. Recent works have demonstrated that the use of machine learning and statistical techniques can detect human activities more accurately. In this paper, we have classified two different physical activities, viz., walking and brisk-walking using a deep neural network (DNN). The personalized data has been collected using multiple sensors of the mobile phone with the two kinds of physical activity. Using mobile phone sensors like accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, etc, data has been collected, examined, and used for training and testing the DNN model. Out of multiple sensors on the phone, we have identified the sensors which are more appropriate for the given motion/activities. Finally, we have achieved a classification accuracy of 96.5%. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Post-discharge oncologic surgical complications are costly for patients, families, and healthcare systems. The capacity to predict complications and early intervention can improve postoperative outcomes. In this proof-of-concept study, we used a machine learning approach to explore the potential added value of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and patient-generated health data (PGHD) in predicting post-discharge complications for gastrointestinal (GI) and lung cancer surgery patients. Methods: We formulated post-discharge complication prediction as a binary classification task. Features were extracted from clinical variables, PROs (MD Anderson Symptom Inventory [MDASI]), and PGHD (VivoFit) from a cohort of 52 patients with 134 temporal observation points pre- and post-discharge that were collected from two pilot studies. We trained and evaluated supervised learning classifiers via nested cross-validation. Results: A logistic regression model with L2 regularization trained with clinical data, PROs and PGHD from wearable pedometers achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic of 0.74. Conclusions: PROs and PGHDs captured through remote patient telemonitoring approaches have the potential to improve prediction performance for postoperative complications. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC

AB  - The objective of this proposed work is to design an automated detection system for disease diagnosis using electrocardiogram (ECG) and phonocardiogram (PCG) signals and design the noninvasive devices for monitoring the patient health. The proposed automatic diagnostic system reduces the challenges to interpret the visual subtle changes occurring in the ECG waveforms. Our proposed diagnostic device is to be designed to achieve the highest classification results with accuracy and sensitivity. Our proposed monitoring device is to monitor the movement and activity of elderly people, especially those who are suffering from chronic and Parkinson’s disease. The people who are suffering from Parkinson’s disease are in need of fall detection services, and elderly people who are in need of continuous monitoring are target users of the proposed device. The proposed automatic diagnostic system reduces the challenges of interpreting the visual subtle changes occurring in the ECG waveforms. Our proposed diagnostic device is to be designed to achieve highest classification result with accuracy and sensitivity. This device comprises of heart beat (pulse), ECG and PCG sensors with high sensitivity. These sensors continuously read the pulse rate, ECG signals, and cardiac sounds. The measured ECG signal then undergoes feature extraction phase where the required coordinates for disease classification were derived using Hilbert transform and principal component analysis. After extracting the essential features from the QRS complex of ECG, they were given as input to the artificial neural network classifier, which is trained to diagnose the diseases from obtained features of ECG. The PCG signal is detected by PCG sensor, which represents various valve closures and openings along with murmurs. Z-transform is used finding the envelope of the PCG signal, which is considered to be the effective information about heart sounds. The coefficients are extracted from the PCG signal using linear predictive coding. The classifiers use the training data to understand how the given input variables are related to the class. When the classifier is trained accurately, it can be used to detect the diagnosed disease. There are several classifiers used in order to find the best accuracy. In our proposed system, we have used automated backpropagation network (BPN), convolutional neural network with Boltzman, decision tree, k-singular valve decomposition with method of optimal directions and Pan-Tompkins algorithm. Among all these, BPN gives the best accuracy. Here the measured sensor data were sent to a mobile via Bluetooth and an android application in the mobile sends these input parameters to the cloud where all the previously mentioned processes were carried out. Finally, the classifier in the cloud provides the information about the diagnosed disease with all results to the doctor and also to the patient caretaker. © 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Tactile sensors have received significant attention due to their broad applications in artificial intelligence, health-care monitoring, wearable devices, and soft robotics. Over the past decade, tactile sensors have developed from static devices to “smart” devices to compensate for incidental mechanical cutting. However, profound challenges remain in terms of tactile sensors because of their difficult combination of self-healing and sensory properties. In this chapter, the challenges and potential developments in the field of self-healing tactile sensors are elaborated by first introducing the relevant structure characteristics before discussing the selected applications in detail. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.

AB  - Current wearable sensors are fabricated with substrates, which limits the comfort, flexibility, stretchability, and induces interface mismatch. In addition, the substrate prevents the evaporation of sweat and is harmful to skin health. In this work, we have enabled the substrate-free laser scribed graphene (SFG) electronic skin (e-skin) with multifunctions. Compared with the e-skin with the substrate, the SFG has good gas permeability, low impedance, and flexibility. Only assisted using water, the SFG can be transferred to almost any objects including silicon and human skin and it can even be suspended. Many through-holes like stomas in leaf can be formed in the SFG, which make it breathable. After designing the pattern, the gauge factor (GF) of graphene electronic skin (GES) can be designed as the strain sensor. Physiological signals such as respiration, human motion, and electrocardiogram (ECG) can be detected. Moreover, the suspended SFG detect vibrations with high sensitivity. Due to the substrate-free structure, the impedance between SFG e-skin and the human body decreases greatly. Finally, an ECG detecting system has been designed based on the GES, which can monitor the body condition in real time. To analyze the ECG signals automatically, a convolutional neural network (CNN) was built and trained successfully. This work has high potential in the field of health telemonitoring.  © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, novel digital health technologies have the potential to improve our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, improve care delivery, and produce better health outcomes. The National Institutes of Health called on digital health leaders to contribute to a high-quality data repository that will support researchers to make discoveries that are otherwise not possible with small, limited data sets. Objective: To this end, we seek to develop a COVID-19 digital biomarker for early detection of physiological exacerbation or decompensation. We propose the development and validation of a COVID-19 decompensation Index (CDI) in a 2-phase study that builds on existing wearable biosensor-derived analytics generated by physIQ's end-to-end cloud platform for continuous physiological monitoring with wearable biosensors. This effort serves to achieve two primary objectives: (1) to collect adequate data to help develop the CDI and (2) to collect rich deidentified clinical data correlating with outcomes and symptoms related to COVID-19 progression. Our secondary objectives include evaluation of the feasibility and usability of pinpointIQ, a digital platform through which data are gathered, analyzed, and displayed. Methods: This is a prospective, nonrandomized, open-label, 2-phase study. Phase I will involve data collection for the digital data hub of the National Institutes of Health as well as data to support the preliminary development of the CDI. Phase II will involve data collection for the hub and contribute to continued refinement and validation of the CDI. While this study will focus on the development of a CDI, the digital platform will also be evaluated for feasibility and usability while clinicians deliver care to continuously monitored patients enrolled in the study. Results: Our target CDI will be a binary classifier trained to distinguish participants with and those without decompensation. The primary performance metric for CDI will be the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve with a minimum performance criterion of ≥0.75 (α=.05; power [1-β]=0.80). Furthermore, we will determine the sex or gender and race or ethnicity of the participants, which would account for differences in the CDI performance, as well as the lead time-time to predict decompensation-and its relationship with the ultimate disease severity based on the World Health Organization COVID-19 ordinal scale. Conclusions: Using machine learning techniques on a large data set of patients with COVID-19 could provide valuable insights into the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and a digital biomarker for COVID-19 decompensation. Through this study, we intend to develop a tool that can uniquely reflect physiological data of a diverse population and contribute to high-quality data that will help researchers better understand COVID-19. ©Karen Larimer, Stephan Wegerich, Joel Splan, David Chestek, Heather Prendergast, Terry Vanden Hoek.

AB  - Wearable electronic textiles are used in sensors, energy-harvesting devices, healthcare monitoring, human-machine interfaces, and soft robotics to acquire real-time big data for machine learning and artificial intelligence. Wearability is essential while collecting data from a human, who should be able to wear the device with sufficient comfort. In this study, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and silver nanowires (AgNWs) were supersonically sprayed onto a fabric to ensure good adhesiveness, resulting in a washable, stretchable, and wearable fabric without affecting the performance of the designed features. This rGO/AgNW-decorated fabric can be used to monitor external stimuli such as strain and temperature. In addition, it is used as a heater and as a supercapacitor and features an antibacterial hydrophobic surface that minimizes potential infection from external airborne viruses or virus-containing droplets. Herein, the wearability, stretchability, washability, mechanical durability, temperature-sensing capability, heating ability, wettability, and antibacterial features of this metallized fabric are explored. This multifunctionality is achieved in a single fabric coated with rGO/AgNWs via supersonic spraying. ©

AB  - One of the major healthcare challenges is elderly fallers. A fall can lead to disabilities and even mortality. With the current Covid-19 pandemic, insufficient resources could be provided for the care of elderlies, and care workers often may not be able to visit them. Therefore, a fall may get undetected or delayed leading to serious harm or consequences. Automatic fall detection systems could provide the necessary detection and warnings for timely intervention. Although many sensor-based fall detection systems have been proposed, most systems focus on the sudden fall and have not considered the slow fall scenario, a typical fall instance for elderly fallers. In this paper, a robust activity (RA) and slow fall detection system is proposed. The system consists of a waist-worn wearable sensor embedded with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a barometer, and a reference ambient barometer. A deep neural network (DNN) is developed for fusing the sensor data and classifying fall events. The results have shown that the IMU-barometer design yield better detection of fall events and the DNN approach (90.33% accuracy) outperforms traditional machine learning algorithms.  © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has led to many physicians working from home whenever possible. Although the concept of ‘remote’ patient care has been around for decades, present circumstances have provided a grand impetus in that direction with a view to protecting both patient and caregiver. In this article, we discuss some of the various challenges to moving forward with telemedicine, drawing in part on our own experiences in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinical, technical, financial and cultural barriers to telemedicine are identified, along with a discussion concerning anticipated benefits. We conclude that the COVID-19 pandemic will likely forever change how healthcare is conducted as telemedicine figures increasingly prominently in the clinical landscape. © 2020 Royal Australasian College of Physicians

AB  - Background: Pancreatic cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths, and although pancreatectomy is currently the only curative treatment, it is associated with significant morbidity. Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the utility of wearable telemonitoring technologies to predict treatment outcomes using patient activity metrics and machine learning. Methods: In this prospective, single-center, single-cohort study, patients scheduled for pancreatectomy were provided with a wearable telemonitoring device to be worn prior to surgery. Patient clinical data were collected and all patients were evaluated using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program surgical risk calculator (ACS-NSQIP SRC). Machine learning models were developed to predict whether patients would have a textbook outcome and compared with the ACS-NSQIP SRC using area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves. Results: Between February 2019 and February 2020, 48 patients completed the study. Patient activity metrics were collected over an average of 27.8 days before surgery. Patients took an average of 4162.1 (SD 4052.6) steps per day and had an average heart rate of 75.6 (SD 14.8) beats per minute. Twenty-eight (58%) patients had a textbook outcome after pancreatectomy. The group of 20 (42%) patients who did not have a textbook outcome included 14 patients with severe complications and 11 patients requiring readmission. The ACS-NSQIP SRC had an AUROC curve of 0.6333 to predict failure to achieve a textbook outcome, while our model combining patient clinical characteristics and patient activity data achieved the highest performance with an AUROC curve of 0.7875. Conclusions: Machine learning models outperformed ACS-NSQIP SRC estimates in predicting textbook outcomes after pancreatectomy. The highest performance was observed when machine learning models incorporated patient clinical characteristics and activity metrics. © 2021 Journal of Medical Internet Research. All rights reserved.

AB  - Diagnostic tests and tools help the recognition and essence of disease. It is therefore critical that the diagnosis is correct, for this is the basis of care and treatment. A clear diagnosis allows patient care to be improved, contributes positively to healthcare costs, and encourages health workers to take the steps necessary. Patient surveillance is also important to avoid further deterioration of the patient’s condition. The measures needed are taken if the condition deteriorates and is alerted by a continuous monitoring program. The measures taken to treat a patient are incredibly useful after effective diagnosis and regular monitoring. So, in medical devices, the three prime factors are early diagnosis, constant monitoring, and finally, cure of the patients through appropriate treatment. Thus, this chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the medical devices that are responsible to diagnose, monitor, and treat several common diseases. The use of artificial intelligence, the internet of things, and app-based detection and monitoring techniques have proved beneficial to support the medical team for the timely cure of the patients. With the global pandemic engulfing the world, this modern technique of diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment can deliver good enough support for the medical community, so maximum causalities may be avoided. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The world right now is dealing with a nightmare in the form of Corona virus disease. COVID-19 has been declared a pandemic by the WHO. It’s an infectious disease caused by virus called SARS-CoV-2. The symptoms of the disease range from fever, dry cough, headaches to difficulty in breathing. Technology has been making it out lives easier and how. The healthcare system also incorporates technology everywhere. We can use latest technologies to deal with crisis situations such as pandemic. Remote healthcare monitoring is the process of monitoring patients in a non-clinical environment. The patients can be provided with sensors and wearable’s to monitor them from afar. The devices range from wearable health monitors to fit bits. Artificial Intelligence is the future, everyone says. With help of technology, devices can check that people are maintaining social distancing and have their masks on. The data collected can be used to make people aware during a pandemic situation. It can be psychologically disturbing and stir up all sorts of feelings, like unreasonable fear and stress. Online counseling also proves helpful to those who shy way in going to hospitals to discuss issues such as depression. It also breaks the barrier of stigma among the patients. © 2021 Scrivener Publishing LLC.

AB  - Pregnancy requires constant monitoring by health care providers to avoid conditions that may threaten the lives of the fetus and the mother at birth. For labor management, the diagnosis of fetal presentation is essential to guarantee delivery viability. A direct indicator of fetal presentation is the fetal head location, which can be placed close to the canal birth (cephalic, head-first) or far from the canal birth (breech, feet first). Unlike urban areas, the population in rural zones experience difficulties in accessing healthcare monitoring. Although telemedicine has helped bring medical technology closer to these regions, the diagnosis still requires medical specialists. This study presents an automatic three-stage detection framework for assessing the fetal head position (and hence the fetal presentation). The first stage involves applying morphological filtering, intensity-based thresholding, and shapebased filtering for a preliminary head detection and segmentation. The second stage comprises segmentation enhancement using a combinatory approach. The third stage uses the detection results to depict the spatial location likelihood of the head, which indicates the head location and fetal presentation. Fifteen volunteers in the third trimester of pregnancy were evaluated, and the fetal presentation was diagnosed. These results were compared with the diagnosis of a radiologist (used as a gold standard). The proposed method presented a 100% accuracy in determining the fetal presentation, albeit a limited number of cases evaluated. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

AB  - Superhydrophobic wearable textile electronics are of great promising devices due to their broad application in healthcare monitoring and artificial intelligence, etc. MXenes, the emerging two‐dimensional (2D) carbides and carbonitrides, are ideal candidates for fabricating wearable electronic devices. However, in an effort to maintain its highly conductive and long-term stability of cotton fabrics under harsh condition, it is an imperative demand to prepare superhydrophobic MXenes-textile sensor. Herein, a waterproof, highly sensitive, and wearable multi-mode sensor was successfully fabricated by the construction of 2D MXene nanosheets and zero-dimension (0D) silicon nanoparticles (SiNPs) onto a cotton fibers substrate (MX@SiNPs cotton). The as-cultivated MX@SiNPs cotton exhibited an integration of high-performance sensing toward pression, bending, and torsion, superior sensitivity (S1 = 12.23 kPa−1), a stable response under press-relaxing cycles, and broad sensing ranges (pressure: 8.8 Pa – 70 kPa, bending: 0 – 180°, torsion: 0 – 628 rad m−1). By virtue of its hierarchical structure and low surface energy of the SiNPs layer, the MXenes-textile sensor can maintain intrinsic conductivity under wet and corrosive conditions. The waterproof and highly sensitive MXene-reinforced cotton fabrics lay a basis for the broad-range application and large-scale preparation of the sensor and prolong its service life. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - With the rapid development in smart medical devices, internet of things has a large applicability in the healthcare sector. The current system is based on a centralized communication with cloud servers. However, this architecture increases security and privacy risks. This paper describes an architecture of a smart healthcare system for remote patient monitoring. To ensure security and privacy, the architecture uses blockchain technology. For data analysis, smart contracts and artificial intelligence are used. The architecture is divided into three layers: smart medical devices layer, fog layer, and cloud layer. To validate the proposed approach, a scenario based on diabetes management system is described. The architecture is applied to provide remote diabetic patient monitoring. The system could suggest treatments, generate proactive predictions, and predict future complications as well as alerting physicians in case of emergency. © 2021 IGI Global. All rights reserved.

AB  - The intervention of virus-infected persons mainly relies on diagnostic methods, and accordingly COVID-19 is not an exception. Thus, a major research direction in viral diagnosis is aligned towards biological- and biomedical-based approaches. In contrast, there is plenty of scope in wearable devices towards early intervention and continuous health status monitoring. Of particular interest, piezo- and pyro-electric wearable sensors can play a significant role by detecting physiological signals in the virus-affected patients. Remotely monitoring physiological signals, such as temperature, respiration, heart rate and other data is an added advantage, where the integration of artificial intelligence is possible. This can improve clinical decision-making paths. In this perspective, the most relevant piezo- and pyro-electric sensor-based wearable sensors for healthcare monitoring towards the early detection of virus-affected abnormalities are highlighted. To implement these types of sensors, the relevant fundamentals of piezo- and pyro-electricity are also discussed. Additionally, relevant materials and device structures are reviewed in order to understand the pros and cons, and thus further improvement can be applied according to the requirements. The envisioned strategy for the early detection of virus-suspected patients through non-invasive wearable sensors is becoming very important in non-contact-based physiological data collection, particularly in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020.

AB  - The increasing popularity of wearable consumer products can play a significant role in the healthcare sector. The recognition of human activities from IoT is an important building block in this context. While the analysis of the generated datastream can have many benefits from a health point of view, it can also lead to privacy threats by exposing highly sensitive information. In this article, we propose a framework that relies on machine learning to efficiently recognise the user activity, useful for personal healthcare monitoring, while limiting the risk of users re-identification from biometric patterns characterizing each individual. To achieve that, we show that features in temporal domain are useful to discriminate user activity while features in frequency domain lead to distinguish the user identity. We then design a novel protection mechanism processing the raw signal on the user's smartphone to select relevant features for activity recognition and normalise features sensitive to re-identification. These unlinkable features are then transferred to the application server. We extensively evaluate our framework with reference datasets: Results show an accurate activity recognition (87%) while limiting the re-identification rate (33%). This represents a slight decrease of utility (9%) against a large privacy improvement (53%) compared to state-of-the-art baselines. © 2020 ACM.

AB  - With the explosive development of smart wearable devices, a serious situation that a large amount of energy waste and environmental pollution caused by electronic discarding needs to be solved urgently. Here, as a throwaway waste material, a chewed gum can be reused for the preparation of wearable iontronics simply. A new gum sensor was constructed by regularly stretching a chewed gum in 6 M NaCl aqueous or even a Chinese edible salt solution for increasing the ionic conductivity. This gum sensor can be shaped arbitrarily, and the preparation process is green, pollution-free, with low energy consumption, and repeatable. Herein, this gum sensor can be utilized for real-time human healthcare monitoring effectively (i.e., facial mood changes, finger flexion, long time walking, and continuous ankle movement) and shows a fast response time of 297 ms and a reliable cycling performance in monitoring body motions. Furthermore, the gum sensor (containing edible salt) can act as a signal transmitter for intelligent information encryption and transmission in the light of the international Morse code with excellent repeatability and stability. Hence, this work will greatly possess wide potential application prospects in wearable electronics and information encryption. This gum sensor also provides a ponderable option in the next generation of artificial intelligence devices, which can address the troubles of material selections in sensor preparation. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The term «Internet of Medical Things» (IoMT) refers to a set of devices and technologies for remote monitoring of patients’ health using wearable devices. One primary problem with patient’s data is ensuring privacy when it is transmitted over open communication channels and stored in cloud systems. A whole range of different approaches to these issues are available. However, when it comes to millions of IoT devices, technologies that have already become classic for Internet resources are not suitable in many aspects at once. The aim of this work is to develop methods and protocols for secure interaction between portable diagnostic devices and cloud services for the analysis and processing of medical data in the Internet of Medical Things networks. The work considered existing technologies and solutions for ensuring security in IoMT networks and personalized medicine systems; also, it focused on secure machine learning methods. Previous studies have emphasized attribute-based encryption (ABE) as a prospective method for data privacy and security. These algorithms solve many problems for IoMT applications: patient’s data confidentiality, flexible key management, fine-grained access control mechanisms, and user control over data. We have proposed a framework for processing patient data from portable diagnostic devices using ABE methods. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Measurement of vital signs of the human body such as heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature and respiratory rate is an important part of diagnosing medical conditions and these are usually measured using medical equipment. In this paper, we propose to estimate an important vital sign - heart rate from speech signals using machine learning algorithms. Existing literature, observation and experience suggest the existence of a correlation between speech characteristics and physiological, psychological as well as emotional conditions. In this work, we estimate the heart rate of individuals by applying machine learning based regression algorithms to Mel frequency cepstrum coefficients, which represent speech features in the spectral domain as well as the temporal variation of spectral features. The estimated heart rate is compared with actual measurement made using a conventional medical device at the time of recording speech. We obtain estimation accuracy close to 94% between the estimated and actual measured heart rate values. Binary classification of heart rate as 'normal' or 'abnormal' is also achieved with 100% accuracy. A comparison of machine learning algorithms in terms of heart rate estimation and classification accuracy is also presented. Heart rate measurement using speech has applications in remote monitoring of patients, professional athletes and can facilitate telemedicine. © 2021 Polish Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents a heart disease prediction model. Among the recent technology, internet of thingsenabled healthcare plays a vital role. The medical sensors used in healthcare provide a huge volume of medical data in a continuous manner. The speed of data generation in IoT healthcare is high so the volume of data is also high. In order to overcome this problem, the proposed model is a novel threestep process to store and analyze the large volumes of data. The first step focuses on a collection of data from sensor devices. In Step 2, HBase has been used to store the large volume of medical sensor data from a wearable device to the cloud. Step 3 uses Mahout for devolving logistic regression-based prediction model. At last, ROC curve is used to find the parameters that cause heart disease. © 2021 IGI Global. All rights reserved.

AB  - There are three technologies that highly contributed to the development of our life. Those technologies are Internet of Things (IoT), Machine Learning (ML) and Block Chain. Recently, IoT and ML played important role in healthcare monitoring management through self-management. Self-management resulted in effective treatment in a lower cost. The IoT uses sensors to monitor the patients' health and collect data from patients, transfer these data to ML for extraction, classification and mining, and use the pure data for prediction of the diseases. This facilitates communication between doctor and patient through wearable technologies. The objective is to provide real-Time monitoring of chronic diseases such as heart failure, asthma, diabetes, heart attacks etc. So we present a full review of the IoT based ML techniques for healthcare applications. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Smart information systems are based on sensors that generate a huge amount of data. This data can be stored in cloud for further processing and efficient utilization. Anomalous data might be present within the sensor data due to various reasons (e.g., malicious activities by intruders, low quality sensors, and node deployment in harsh environments). Anomaly detection is crucial in some applications such as healthcare monitoring systems, forest fire information systems, and other internet of things (IoT) systems. This paper proposes a Gaussian distribution-based supervised machine learning scheme of anomaly detection (GDA) for healthcare monitoring sensor cloud, which is an integration of various body sensors of different patients and cloud. This work is implemented in Python. Use of Gaussian statistical model in the proposed scheme improves precision, throughput, and efficiency. GDA provides 98% efficiency with 3% and 4% improvements as compared to the other supervised learning-based anomaly detection schemes (e.g., support vector machine [SVM] and self-organizing map [SOM], respectively).

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) revolution is redesigning modern city, home, health care and industry services and applications with promising technological, economic, and social prospects. The potential of the emerging Internet of Things technology has been presented in this chapter with focus on current and probable applications in the healthcare domain. The Internet of Things will bring seamless ‘anytime, anywhere’ personalized healthcare and monitoring over fast reliable and secure networks. Big data and IoT are topical emerging technologies that attract focus from several researchers and engineers to develop the next generation of smarter connected devices/products. From providing services for creating smart homes to smart cities, the IoT intelligent system offer better solutions, by automating processes, facilitating collaboration, and securely managing information. It will lead to widespread variety of services to more population which in turn will lead to overall lifestyle improvement and seamless connectivity. A collection of interconnected IoT devices in conjunction with machine learning and artificial intelligence is used to perform predictive analysis, diagnosis, remote monitoring, and preventative analysis. Expanding wireless communication technologies and services requires compact antennas operating over a wide range of frequency band such as ISM, UWB and mmWave range. The antennas need to be compact, application specific to support the Internet-of-Things for sensing and onward transmission over the wireless networks. Hence, this chapter also explores the potential of different technologies and state-of-the art techniques for potential, wearable antennas for on-and off-body smart devices. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Because of the rapid and serious nature of acute cardiovascular disease (CVD) especially ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), a leading cause of death worldwide, prompt diagnosis and treatment is of crucial importance to reduce both mortality and morbidity. During a pandemic such as coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), it is critical to balance cardiovascular emergencies with infectious risk. In this work, we recommend using wearable device based mobile health (mHealth) as an early screening and real-Time monitoring tool to address this balance and facilitate remote monitoring to tackle this unprecedented challenge. This recommendation may help to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of acute CVD patient management while reducing infection risk.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Advancement in sensor technologies has resulted in rapid evolution of Internet of Things (IoT) applications for developing behavioral and physiological monitoring systems such as IoT-based student healthcare monitoring system. Nowadays, a growing number of students living alone scattered over wide geographical areas, and tracking their health function status is necessary. In this paper, an IoT-based student healthcare monitoring model is proposed to continuously check student vital signs and detect biological and behavioral changes via smart healthcare technologies. In this model, vital data are collected via IoT devices and data analysis is carried out through the machine learning methods for detecting the probable risks of student’s physiological and behavioral changes. The experimental results reveal that the proposed model meets the efficiency and proper accuracy for detecting the students’ condition. After evaluating the proposed model, the support vector machine has achieved the highest accuracy of 99.1% which is a promising result for our purpose. The results outperformed decision tree, random forest, and multilayer perceptron neural network algorithms as well. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In today's world, everyone's health is a major concern and a top priority. Humans are afflicted with a plethora of diseases because of their unhealthy habits. People are primarily affected by heart attacks and low oxygen levels because of poor medical care and late diagnosis. As a result, this work aims to combat such untimely deaths using smart health monitoring, which employs machine learning and IoT. The proposed system includes ThingSpeak cloud to communicate with the doctor in case of any emergency. This system consists of body temperature sensor, pulse oximeter sensor (for collecting heartbeat rate and oxygen level) and blood pressure sensing module for tracking patient's health. These sensors are interfaced with the Raspberry pi and Arduino Uno microcontroller. The obtained result from patients is continuously monitored and it is updated in LCD and doctor's webpage using Internet of Things. Following these steps, a trained Machine Learning model is used to determine the type of disease being experienced by the patient. This system predicts Normal and two major disease namely Hypertension and Lung disease. By incorporating all these features, we can ensure that people who suffer from heart attacks and lung disease will not die suddenly. The accuracy of this proposed method is 86% approximately in a real time scenario. Furthermore, because raw medical data can be analyzed in a short period of time, the work will aid clinicians in remote monitoring during epidemic situations such as covid. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - The number of older people is increasing in many countries. By 2030, it is estimated that 15% of the overall population will be comprised of people aged 65 and above. Hence, the monitoring and tracking of elder activities to ensure they live an active life has become a major research topic in recent years. In this work, an elderly sub-activity tracking system is developed to detect the sub-activity of the elderly based on their physical activities and indoor location. The physical activities tracking system and indoor location system is combined in this project to enhance the context of the elderly activities (i.e. sub-activities as defined in this project). An indoor location system is developed by using bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacon and BLE scanners to measure the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) signal to detect the location of the elderly. The activity tracking is carried out via a waist wearable device worn by the elderly. Random forest and support vector machine (SVM) are used as machine learning classifiers to predict the activity and indoor location with an accuracy of 95.03% and 86.58%, respectively. The data from activity tracking and indoor location sub-systems will then be combined to derive the sub-activity and push to an online internet of things (IoT) platform for remote monitoring and notification. © 2021, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

AB  - Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a fast-progressive neurodegenerative disease leading to progressive physical immobility with usually normal or mild cognitive and/or behavioural involvement. Many patients are relatively young, instructed, sensitive to new technologies, and professionally active when developing the first symptoms. Older patients usually require more time, encouragement, reinforcement and a closer support but, nevertheless, selecting user-friendly devices, provided earlier in the course of the disease, and engaging motivated carers may overcome many technological barriers. ALS may be considered a model for neurodegenerative diseases to further develop and test new technologies. From multidisciplinary teleconsults to telemonitoring of the respiratory function, telemedicine has the potentiality to embrace other fields, including nutrition, physical mobility, and the interaction with the environment. Brain-computer interfaces and eye tracking expanded the field of augmentative and alternative communication in ALS but their potentialities go beyond communication, to cognition and robotics. Virtual reality and different forms of artificial intelligence present further interesting possibilities that deserve to be investigated. COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented opportunity to speed up the development and implementation of new technologies in clinical practice, improving the daily living of both ALS patients and carers. The present work reviews the current technologies for ALS patients already in place or being under evaluation with published publications, prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020

AB  - Existing performance metrics assess classifiers on single granularity layer. Having multi-layer labels is also possible such as activity recognition datasets. Semantic annotations could be given with multiple granularity layers in these datasets e.g., activity and the current step within that activity like: cooking and taking ingredients from fridge. Recognizing both layers is important i.e., remote monitoring of patients with dementia. To evaluate a classifier for both layers concurrently, a new performance metric is required. However, it is not easy to design as there are many underlying issues: the relation between the layers and the impact of class imbalance. This work proposes a new metric for evaluating multi-layer labeled dataset considering the mentioned factors and is applied on two datasets. It is found that it can assess the performance of a model classifying activities at two different granularity layers and give more insightful results i.e. reflecting performance for each layer. © 2020 ACM.

AB  - Cardiovascular disorders are one of the major causes of sad death among older and middle-aged people. Over the past two decades, health monitoring services have evolved quickly and had the ability to change the way health care is currently provided. However, the most challenging aspect of the mobile and wearable sensor-based human activity recognition pipeline is the extraction of the related features. Feature extraction decreases both computational complexity and time. Deep learning techniques are used for automatic feature learning in a variety of fields, including health, image classification, and, most recently, for the extraction and classification of complex and straightforward human activity recognition in smart health care. This paper reviews the recent state of the art in electrocardiogram (ECG) smart health monitoring systems based on the Internet of things with the machine and deep learning techniques. Moreover, the paper provided possible research and challenges that can help researchers advance state of art in future work. © Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia Publisher’s Office.

AB  - With the advances of computer vision over the recent years, its applications have extended from handling static images to tackling the challenging domain of video analysis, with human activity recognition being among the core research topics. However, recognizing and recording the activity of agricultural workers through surveillance videos is still understudied. By workload efficiency analysis, the quality of agricultural produce can be determined and improved. In this work, an IoT system that utilizes MQTT messaging protocol to stream visual data collected from wireless monitoring nodes was developed. The video streams were displayed in a mobile APP for farm owners to remotely monitor their workplace and crop situation. A spatiotemporal convolutional network was trained to recognize the actions of the workers from the video streams, while the timestamp and duration were recorded in a remote server. Through vision-based analysis, workload data can be seamlessly extracted from the streaming footage, thereby eliminating the need for additional hardware setup, such as wearable sensors. The proposed algorithm was capable of achieving an average F1 score of 96.9%. The workload data analysis results could be beneficial for farm owners in reevaluating and improving their management strategy. Accurate detection and recording of farm activities will allow them to see if a particular activity had been performed appropriately and at the proper time. Furthermore, the usage of resources, including pesticide and water, can be tracked based on the frequency and duration of the activities. The proposed techniques and methods can be employed not only for agricultural applications, but also for other workplace monitoring applications. © ASABE 2021 Annual International Meeting

AB  - Detecting head- and mouth-related human activities of elderly people are very important for nurse care centers. They need to track different types of activities of elderly people like swallowing, eating, etc., to measure the health status of elderly people. In this regard, earable devices open up interesting possibilities for monitoring personal-scale behavioral activities. Here, we introduce activity recognition based on an earable device called ‘eSense’. It has multiple sensors that can be used for human activity recognition. ‘eSense’ has a 6-axis inertial measurement unit with a microphone and Bluetooth. In this paper, we propose an activity recognition framework using eSense device. We collect accelerometer and gyroscope sensor data from eSense device to detect head- and mouth-related activities along with other normal human activities. We evaluated the classification performance of the classifier using both accelerometer and gyroscope data. For this work, we develop a smartphone application for data collection from the eSense. Several statistical features are exploited to recognize head- and mouth-related activities (e.g., head nodding, head shaking, eating, and speaking), and regular activities (e.g., stay, walk, and speaking while walking). We explored different types of machine learning approaches like Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Random Forest (RnF), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Support Vector Machine (SVM), etc., for classifying activities. We have achieved satisfactory results. Our results show that using both accelerometer and gyroscope sensors can improve performance. We achieve accuracy of 80.45% by LDA, 93.34% by SVM, 91.92% by RnF, 91.64% by KNN, and 93.76% by CNN while we exploit both accelerometer and gyroscope sensor data together. The results demonstrate the prospect of eSense device for detecting human activities in various healthcare monitoring system. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Nowadays, ubiquitous healthcare monitoring applications are becoming a necessity. In a pervasive smart healthcare system, the user's location information is always transmitted periodically to healthcare providers to increase the quality of the service provided to the user. However, revealing the user's location will affect the user's privacy. This paper presents a novel cloud-based secure location privacy-preserving mobile healthcare framework with decision-making capabilities. A user's vital signs are sensed possibly through a wearable healthcare device and transmitted to a cloud server for securely storing user's data, processing, and decision making. The proposed framework integrates a number of features such as machine learning (ML) for classifying a user's health state, and crowdsensing for collecting information about a person's privacy preferences for possible locations and applying such information to a user who did not set his privacy preferences. In addition to location privacy preservation methods (LPPM) such as obfuscation, perturbation and encryption to protect the location of the user and provide a secure monitoring framework. The proposed framework detects clear emergency cases and quickly decides about sending a help message to a healthcare provider before sending data to the cloud server. To validate the efficiency of the proposed framework, a prototype is developed and tested. The obtained results from the proposed prototype prove its feasibility and utility. Compared to the state of art, the proposed framework offers an adaptive context-based decision for location sharing privacy and controlling the trade-off between location privacy and service utility.  © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) has enabled the invention of smart health monitoring systems. These health monitoring systems can track a person's mental and physical wellness. Stress, anxiety, and hypertension are key causes of many physical and mental disorders. Age-related problems such as stress, anxiety, and hypertension necessitate specific attention in this setting. Stress, anxiety, and blood pressure monitoring can prevent long-term damage by detecting problems early. This will increase the quality of life and reduce caregiver stress and healthcare costs. Determine fresh technology solutions for real-time stress, anxiety, and blood pressure monitoring using discreet wearable sensors and machine learning approaches. This study created an automated artefact detection method for BP and PPG signals. It was proposed to automatically remove outlier points generated by movement artefacts from the blood pressure signal. Next, eleven features taken from the oscillometric waveform envelope were utilised to analyse the relationship between diastolic blood pressure (SBP) and systolic blood pressure (DBP). This paper validates a proposed computational method for estimating blood pressure. The proposed architecture leverages sophisticated regression to predict systolic and diastolic blood pressure values from PPG signal characteristics.  © 2021 Malik Bader Alazzam et al.

AB  - In any hospital health care monitoring system, it is necessary to constantly monitor the patient's physiological parameters. Previous studies report that important parameters of any patient that have to be monitored in hospital are heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, temperature, change in systolic blood pressure, motion, posture and its location. This work presents a monitoring system that has the capability to monitor in real-time the physiological parameters of the patient using a comfortable wearable device. A Wireless Sensor Network in collaboration with multiple wireless relay nodes, are responsible for collecting and sending the signals from the wireless sensors to the base station. The data is stored and processed using intelligent techniques in a cloud-based environment. Early warning alerts are automatically sent to the medical staff allowing them to intervene on time and earlier than when using manual vital sign observations. By grouping patients according to risk, medical experts can continuously monitor patients health status and quickly identify those that need their attention most. © 2021 IEEE

AB  - As a result of the rapid development of wearable sensor technology, the use of smartwatch sensors for human activity recognition (HAR) has recently become a popular area of research. Currently, a large number of mobile applications, such as healthcare monitoring, sport performance tracking, etc., are applying the results of major HAR research studies. In this paper, an HAR framework that employs spatialoral features that are automatically extracted from data obtained from smartwatch sensors is proposed. The hybrid deep learning approach is used in the framework through the employment of Long Short-Term Memory Networks and the Convolutional Neural Network, eliminating the need for the manual extraction of features. The advantage of tuning the hyperparameters of each of the considered networks by Bayesian optimization is also utilized. It was indicated by the results that the baseline models are outperformed by the proposed hybrid deep learning model, which has an average accuracy of 96.2% and an F-measure of 96.3%.  © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Heart failure, despite considerable therapeutic progress, remains a frequent, serious and costly disease, particularly because of the very frequent readmissions. Thanks to major advances in information technology and communication, telemedicine (remote medical practice), appears as a promising solution for the improvement of its care. Since ten years, France approved five telemedicine procedures, including telemonitoring, which has been extensively studied for heart failure. It enables the detection early signs of cardiac decompensation and thus, through therapeutic adaptation, avoid hospital readmission. The monitoring of multiple physiological parameters, invasive and non-invasive, is currently possible thanks to many tools (structured telephone support, standalone devices, cardiac implantable devices for therapeutic or diagnostic purposes) with continuous innovations (e.g. wearable devices). Although the result of dozens of randomized clinical trials is divergent (due in particular to the complexity of telemonitoring and the heterogeneity of the techniques used), the different meta-analyzes show a medical and economic benefit of remote monitoring. That is why, pending the results of studies in progress, particularly in France, our country has set up for the first time a real-life experience (ETAPES program). Despite the many unanswered questions, telemedicine, combined with advances in artificial intelligence, represents a huge potential for future management of heart failure. © 2020; L'insuffisance cardiaque, malgré les progrès thérapeutiques considérables, reste une maladie fréquente, grave et coûteuse, notamment en raison des réhospitalisations très fréquentes et la télémédecine (pratique médicale à distance), grâce aux avancées majeures des technologies de l'information et de la communication, apparaît comme une solution prometteuse pour l'amélioration de sa prise en charge. La France reconnaît depuis dix ans cinq actes de télémédecine, dont la télésurveillance qui a été très étudiée dans la défaillance cardiaque, car elle permet de dépister précocement les signes avant-coureurs de décompensation et d’éviter ainsi, via une adaptation thérapeutique, une réadmission. La surveillance de multiples paramètres physiologiques, invasifs et non invasifs, est actuellement possible grâce à de nombreux outils (support téléphonique structuré, objets connectés à domicile, dispositifs médicaux implantables à visée thérapeutique ou diagnostique) avec des innovations continuelles (par exemple, objets connectés portables). Bien que le résultat de dizaines d'essais cliniques randomisés soit divergent (en raison notamment de la complexité de la surveillance à distance et de l'hétérogénéité des techniques employées), les différentes méta-analyses montrent un bénéfice médical et économique de la télésurveillance. C'est pourquoi en attendant les résultats des études en cours, en particulier en France, notre pays a mis en place pour la première fois, une expérience en vie réelle (programme ETAPES). Malgré les nombreuses questions non résolues, la télémédecine, associée aux progrès de l'intelligence artificielle, représente une potentialité énorme pour la prise en charge future de l'insuffisance cardiaque. © 2020

AB  - The healthcare sector has been stretched to its maximum capacity with the outbreak of coronavirus. With a worldwide impact it has highlighted the maximum capabilities and limitations in the existing healthcare facilities worldwide. Such an unprecedented load of healthcare requirements can be supported with Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud services. The limited number of healthcare staff and limited resources urge the use of emerging technologies to support healthcare provision. In such circumstance IoT and cloud computing offer sufficient potential that can be used for monitoring, diagnosis, support, and intelligent decisioning. A smart environment can be created with the collected data from patients, medical equipment, hospitals, ambulances, recovery centers, old-age houses, and nursing homes. The use of cloud services integrated with IoT allows the collection, analysis, and provisioning of support and solution at a rapid rate. This facilitates remote patient-monitoring and safeguards healthcare providers from coming in direct contact with the patient and highly infectious and contagious work environment. It also brings in great potentials for smart-health solutions with enhanced patient observation, monitoring, support, and prediction of vital needs essential in emergency situations. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Estimation of muscle excitations from a reduced sensor array could greatly improve current techniques in remote patient monitoring. Such an approach could allow continuous monitoring of clinically relevant biomechanical variables that are ideal for personalizing rehabilitation. In this paper, we introduce the notion of a muscle synergy function which describes the synergistic relationship between a subset of muscles. We develop from first principles an approximation to their behavior using Gaussian process regression and demonstrate the utility of the technique for estimating the excitation time-series of leg muscles during normal walking for nine healthy subjects. Specifically, excitations for six muscles were estimated using surface electromyography (sEMG) data during a finite time interval (called the input window) from four different muscles (called the input muscles) with mean absolute error (MAE) less than 5.0% of the maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) and that accounts for 82-88% of the variance (VAF) in the true excitations. Further, these estimated excitations informed muscle activations with less than 4.0% MAE and 89-93% VAF. We also present a detailed analysis of a number of different modeling choices, including every possible combination of four-, three- and two-muscle input sets, the size and structure of the input window, and the stationarity of the Gaussian process covariance functions. Further, application specific modifications for future use are discussed. The proposed technique lays a foundation to explore the use of reduced wearable sensor arrays and muscle synergy functions for monitoring clinically relevant biomechanics during daily life.  © 2001-2011 IEEE.

AB  - A Wireless Medical Sensor Network (WMSN) connects autonomous nodes such as (sensors and actuators) existing on the body, or under a person's skin. The network usually extends over the entire human body and nodes are connected via a wireless communication channel. WMSN sense human physiological signs and monitor a patient's health status. The framework and preliminary experiment on developing an anomaly detection model for ubiquitous patient and healthcare monitoring in medical wireless sensor networks (MWSN s)were presented in this study. The architecture is a combination of an improved data mining method and machine learning algorithms using modern fusion methods. Being that MWSNs are highly susceptible to failures due to certain limitations, such as low energy resources, poor reliability, low computational resources, and considerable susceptibility to post-deployment security attacks, the proposed model is an anomaly detection method for MWSNs for the detection of anomalies in an adaptive manner with high accuracy while maintaining resource constraints using two phases. First, an anomaly-based detection model was created using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique to reduce dimensionality, prevent overfitting, and increase detection accuracy. Second, the detection accuracy of the proposed model was evaluated and compare before and after PCA integration. The experimental study showed that the proposed model can rapidly identify sensor anomalies with high accuracy.  © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Coronavirus (COVID-19) is a new virus of viral pneumonia. It can outbreak in the world through person-to-person transmission. Although several medical companies provide cooperative monitoring healthcare systems, these solutions lack offering of the end-to-end management of the disease. The main objective of the proposed framework is to bridge the current gap between current technologies and healthcare systems. The wireless body area network, cloud computing, fog computing, and clinical decision support system are integrated to provide a comprehensive and complete model for disease detection and monitoring. By monitoring a person with COVID-19 in real time, physicians can guide patients with the right decisions. The proposed framework has three main layers (i.e., a patient layer, cloud layer, and hospital layer). In the patient layer, the patient is tracked through a set of wearable sensors and a mobile app. In the cloud layer, a fog network architecture is proposed to solve the issues of storage and data transmission. In the hospital layer, we propose a convolutional neural network-based deep learning model for COVID-19 detection based on patient’s X-ray scan images and transfer learning. The proposed model achieved promising results compared to the state-of-the art (i.e., accuracy of 97.95% and specificity of 98.85%). Our framework is a useful application, through which we expect significant effects on COVID-19 proliferation and considerable lowering in healthcare expenses. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Abnormal level of stress is the root indicator factor to have significant impact over the health of heart and there is a close relationship between the stress levels with heart rate. Review of the existing literature showcase that there has been various work that has been carried out towards investigation of considering heart rate with an internet-of-things (IoT) system. Apart from this, existing system doesnt offer any instantaneous solution where certain intimation is offered in real-time to the user with wearables as a solution to control the stress condition. Therefore, the current paper introduces a novel framework where the sampled heart rates of the patients are captured by IoT deivices. The aggregated data are further forwarded to the cloud analytic system that uses correlation to extract the appropriate message. The system after being applied with teh machine learning approach could further extract the elite outcome followed by forwarding the contextual data to teh user. Using an analytical modelliig, the proposed system shows that it offers better accuracy and reduced processing time when compared with other machine learning approach and thereby it proves to be cost effective solution in IoT system over medical case study.

AB  - Recently, the techniques of Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile communications have been developed to gather human and environment information data for a variety of intelligent services and applications. Remote monitoring of elderly and disabled people living in smart homes is highly challenging due to probable accidents which might occur due to daily activities such as falls. For elderly people, fall is considered as a major reason for death of post-traumatic complication. So, early identification of elderly people falls in smart homes is needed to increase the survival rate of the person or offer required support. Recently, the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), IoT, wearables, smartphones, etc. makes it feasible to design fall detection systems for smart homecare. In this view, this paper presents an IoT enabled elderly fall detection model using optimal deep convolutional neural network (IMEFD-ODCNN) for smart homecare. The goal of the IMEFD-ODCNN model is to enable smartphones and intelligent deep learning (DL) algorithms to detect the occurrence of falls in the smart home. Primarily, the input video captured by the IoT devices is pre-processed in different ways like resizing, augmentation, and min-max based normalization. Besides, SqueezeNet model is employed as a feature extraction technique to derive appropriate feature vectors for fall detection. In addition, the hyperparameter tuning of the SqueezeNet model takes place using the salp swarm optimization (SSO) algorithm. Finally, sparrow search optimization algorithm (SSOA) with variational autoencoder (VAE), called SSOA-VAE based classifier is employed for the classification of fall and non-fall events. Finally, in case of fall event detected, the smartphone sends an alert to the caretakers and hospital management. The performance validation of the IMEFD-ODCNN model takes place on UR fall detection dataset and multiple cameras fall dataset. The experimental outcomes highlighted the promising performance of the IMEFD-ODCNN model over the recent methods with the maximum accuracy of 99.76% and 99.57% on the multiple cameras fall and UR fall detection dataset.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The possibilities and implementation of wearable cardiac monitoring beyond atrial fibrillation are increasing continuously. This review focuses on the real-world use and evolution of these devices for other arrhythmias, cardiovascular diseases and some of their risk factors beyond atrial fibrillation. The management of nonatrial fibrillation arrhythmias represents a broad field of wearable technologies in cardiology using Holter, event recorder, electrocardiogram (ECG) patches, wristbands and textiles. Implementation in other patient cohorts, such as ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), heart failure or sleep apnea, is feasible and expanding. In addition to appropriate accuracy, clinical studies must address the validation of clinical pathways including the appropriate device and clinical decisions resulting from the surrogate assessed. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - With the massive progress of Internet of Things based technologies, the importance of remote monitoring has increased by many folds especially for the assistance of patients suffering from life threatening diseases. This work deals with the detection of Freezing of Gait in patients having Parkinson's disease with the help of wearable acceleration sensors placed on their legs and hips which consequently results in their real-time remote monitoring. This work proposes a FoG detection method based on Grey Relational Analysis which uses the readings from the sensors to predict the presence or absence of freezing in a patient. Additionally, an ensemble learning approach that uses Grey Relational Analysis as the base classification model has also been illustrated for FoG detection. The proposed approaches have been applied on benchmark Daphnet Freezing of Gait data set to verify their feasibility. The simulation results show that the proposed approaches have better accuracy when compared to other existing machine learning techniques. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Long-term blood pressure (BP) monitoring is a widely used approach in a homecare intelligent system. However, BP is usually measured using cuff-based devices with tedious operation in practice, which may not be cost effective for continuous BP tracking. In this article, we propose a novel attention-based multitask network with a weighting scheme for BP estimation by analyzing and modeling single lead electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method could achieve mean error of systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and mean arterial pressure estimation in levels of 0.18 $\pm$ 10.83, 1.24 $\pm$ 5.90, and 0.84 $\pm$ 6.47 mmHg, respectively. In comparison to other cutting-edge methods using ECG signals, the proposed method shows superior BP estimation performance. By integrating with a wearable/portable ECG monitoring device, the proposed model can be deployed to an embedded system or remote healthcare intelligent system to provide long-term BP monitoring service, which would help to reduce the incidence of malignant events happened in hypertensive population. © 2005-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is an intriguing approach to healthcare monitoring that necessitates the ongoing utilization of wearable sensors to capture everyday activities. The most advanced studies using wearable devices have used a cloud computing paradigm that categorized data at remote systems. This method has drawbacks in terms of energy consumption, latency, and privacy. As a result, we adhere to a low-power computing structure in which wearable device solutions achieve an acceptable level of performance while being energy and memory-efficient. This study proposes a lightweight deep learning model termed a gate recurrent unit (GRU) network for energy-efficient HAR appropriate for low-power wearable devices. The introduced GRU network is evaluated against a benchmark dataset named the w-HAR dataset, including essential deep learning networks. The proposed GRU surpasses baseline deep learning networks in terms of overall accuracy, with a score of 95.160%.  © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Background: Subtle abnormal motor signs are indications of serious neurological diseases. Although neurological deficits require fast initiation of treatment in a restricted time, it is difficult for nonspecialists to detect and objectively assess the symptoms. In the clinical environment, diagnoses and decisions are based on clinical grading methods, including the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score or the Medical Research Council (MRC) score, which have been used to measure motor weakness. Objective grading in various environments is necessitated for consistent agreement among patients, caregivers, paramedics, and medical staff to facilitate rapid diagnoses and dispatches to appropriate medical centers. Objective: In this study, we aimed to develop an autonomous grading system for stroke patients. We investigated the feasibility of our new system to assess motor weakness and grade NIHSS and MRC scores of 4 limbs, similar to the clinical examinations performed by medical staff. Methods: We implemented an automatic grading system composed of a measuring unit with wearable sensors and a grading unit with optimized machine learning. Inertial sensors were attached to measure subtle weaknesses caused by paralysis of upper and lower limbs. We collected 60 instances of data with kinematic features of motor disorders from neurological examination and demographic information of stroke patients with NIHSS 0 or 1 and MRC 7, 8, or 9 grades in a stroke unit. Training data with 240 instances were generated using a synthetic minority oversampling technique to complement the imbalanced number of data between classes and low number of training data. We trained 2 representative machine learning algorithms, an ensemble and a support vector machine (SVM), to implement auto-NIHSS and auto-MRC grading. The optimized algorithms performed a 5-fold cross-validation and were searched by Bayes optimization in 30 trials. The trained model was tested with the 60 original hold-out instances for performance evaluation in accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC). Results: The proposed system can grade NIHSS scores with an accuracy of 83.3% and an AUC of 0.912 using an optimized ensemble algorithm, and it can grade with an accuracy of 80.0% and an AUC of 0.860 using an optimized SVM algorithm. The auto-MRC grading achieved an accuracy of 76.7% and a mean AUC of 0.870 in SVM classification and an accuracy of 78.3% and a mean AUC of 0.877 in ensemble classification. Conclusions: The automatic grading system quantifies proximal weakness in real time and assesses symptoms through automatic grading. The pilot outcomes demonstrated the feasibility of remote monitoring of motor weakness caused by stroke. The system can facilitate consistent grading with instant assessment and expedite dispatches to appropriate hospitals and treatment initiation by sharing auto-MRC and auto-NIHSS scores between prehospital and hospital responses as an objective observation. © Eunjeong Park, Kijeong Lee, Taehwa Han, Hyo Suk Nam.

AB  - Technology adoption in healthcare services has resulted in advancing care delivery services and improving the experiences of patients. This paper presents research that aims to find the important requirements for a remote monitoring system for patients with COVID-19. As this pandemic is growing more and more, there is a critical need for such systems. In this paper, the requirements and the value are determined for the proposed system, which integrates a smart bracelet that helps to signal patient vital signs. (376) participants completed the online quantitative survey. According to the study results, Most Healthcare Experts, (97.9%) stated that the automated wearable device is very useful, it plays an essential role in routine healthcare tasks (in early diagnosis, quarantine enforcement, and patient status monitoring), and it simplifies their routine healthcare activities. I addition, the main vital signs based on their expert opinion should include temperature (66% of participants) and oxygenation level (95% of participants). These findings are essential to any academic and industrial future efforts to develop these vital wearable systems. The future work will involve implementing the design based on the results of this study and use machine-learning algorithm to better detect the COVID-19 cases based on the monitoring of vital signs and symptoms.  © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - With the invent of medical expert systems, the demand for efficient innovative techniques in signal processing to detect abnormalities is ever increasing for identifying heart-related problems. The major objective of this research is to offer medical services to people in remote villages at low cost. People in villages and remote areas do not have a facility to get treated by a medical expert. This research provides them an opportunity to get medical advice through the virtual environment called the VH-doctor machine. It is a virtual environment heart doctor and reduces the human effort in testing and treating of heart diseases at the initial stages. The patients are treated and diagnosed only with the help of machines but not human effort. Biomedical sensors, ARM processor and FPGA are used to detect, test, analyze and display normal or abnormal cases. In this research, ECG signal processing, feature extraction and KNN classifier are performed and achieve the highest accuracy of 99% better than other machine learning algorithms. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Internet of things (IoT) and machine learning based systems incorporating smart wearable technology are rapidly evolving to monitor and manage healthcare and physical activities. This paper is focused on the proposition of a fog-centric wireless, real-time, smart wearable and IoT-based framework for ubiquitous health and fitness analysis in a smart gym environment. The proposed framework aims to aid in the health and fitness industry based on body vitals, body movement and health related data. The framework is expected to assist athletes, trainers and physicians with the interpretation of multiple physical signs and raise alerts in case of any health hazard. We proposed a method to collect and analyze exercise specific data which can be used to measure exercise intensity and its benefit to athlete's health and serve as recommendation system for upcoming athletes. We determined the validity of the proposed framework by giving a six weeks workout plan with six days a week for workout activity targeting all muscles followed by one day for recovery. We recorded the electrocardiogram, heart rate, heart rate variability, breath rate, and determined athlete's movement using a 3D-acceleration. The collected data in the research is used in two modules. A Health zone module implemented on body vitals data which categorizes athlete's health state into various categories. Hzone module is responsible for health hazards identification and alarming. Outstandingly, the Hzone module is able to identify an athlete's physical state with 97% accuracy. A gym activity recognition (GAR) module is implemented to recognize workout activity in real-time using body movements and body vitals data. The purpose of the GAR module is to collect and analyze exercise specific data. The GAR module achieved an accuracy of above 89% on athlete independent model based on muscle group.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Objective: Continuous temperature monitoring in high-risk patients can enable healthcare providers to remotely track patients' temperatures, promptly detect fevers and timely intervene to improve clinical outcomes. We evaluated if a novel wearable, continuous temperature monitor (Verily Patch) can reliably estimate body temperature and early detect fevers in an outpatient setting in patients at a high risk of febrile neutropenia (FN) who recently underwent chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Methods: 86 patients at a high risk for FN were prospectively enrolled at Mayo Clinic, MN. Patients wore the device in their axilla region for 7 days post ASCT and recorded self-measured oral temperatures every 3 hours. Patients were also followed using clinical standard-of-care procedures with daily oral temperature assessment. The clinic-and patient-assessed oral temperatures were used to develop and evaluate Verily Patch's body temperature and early fever detection algorithms using a K-fold cross-validation approach. Results: The Verily Patch reliably measured body temperatures with an error of 0.35 ± 0.88°F in comparison to clinic-and patient-assessed oral temperatures. The sensitivity and specificity of the patch in detecting clinic-assessed fever episodes was 90.2% and 87.8%. The patch detected 14.3 times the number of clinic-assessed fever episodes with a median lead time of 4.3 hours. Conclusion: Patient self-monitoring of temperature and fever incidents suffers from low accuracy and is impractical for extended periods of time. Continuous temperature monitoring by a wearable device (such as Verily Patch) has the potential to overcome these challenges resulting in better patient clinical outcomes and more cost-effective care.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Numerous studies have focused on making telemedicine smart through the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. These works span a wide range of research areas to enhance telemedicine architecture such as network communications, artificial intelligence methods and techniques, IoT wearable sensors and hardware devices, smartphones and cloud computing. Accordingly, several telemedicine applications covering various human diseases have presented their works from a specific perspective and resulted in confusion regarding the IoT characteristics. Although such applications are useful and necessary for improving telemedicine contexts related to monitoring, detection and diagnostics, deriving an overall picture of how IoT characteristics are currently integrated with the telemedicine architecture is difficult. Accordingly, this study complements the academic literature with a systematic review covering all main aspects of advances in IoT-based telemedicine architecture. This study also provides a state-of-the-art telemedicine classification taxonomy under IoT and reviews works in different fields in relation to that classification. To this end, this study checked the ScienceDirect, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Xplore, and Web of Science databases. A total of 2121 papers were collected from 2014 to July 2020. The retrieved articles were filtered according to the defined inclusion criteria. A final set of 141 articles were selected and classified into two categories, each followed by subcategories and sections. The first category includes an IoT-based telemedicine network that accounts for 24.11% (n = 34/141). The second category includes IoT-based telemedicine healthcare services and applications that account for 75.89% (n = 107/141). This multi-field systematic review has exposed new research opportunities, motivations, recommendations and challenges that need attention for the synergistic integration of interdisciplinary works. This extensive study also lists a set of open issues and provides innovative key solutions along with a systematic review. The classification of diseases under IoT-based telemedicine is divided into 14 groups. Furthermore, the crossover in our taxonomy is demonstrated. The lifecycle of the context of IoT-based telemedicine healthcare applications is mapped for the first time, including the procedure sequencing and definition for each context. We believe that this study is a useful guide for researchers and practitioners in providing direction and valuable information for future research. This study can also address the ambiguity in the trends in IoT-based telemedicine. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Internet of Things is an interconnection of objects or things through the internet and enables exchange of data where every object is provided a unique identifier and the data are transferred through the network. All the devices can be connected to a network and controlled at our fingertips using web-based applications or mobile applications. This technology fosters the growth of the internet and reduces human intervention, thereby making life very easy. Due to the transformation of agriculture to smart agriculture, cities to smart cities, payments to smart payments, IoT plays a major role in all the fields prevalent in today’s society. It is also predicted that in the coming years, the number of devices and applications that are connected will exponentially increase. With the rapid growth and a busy world, it is necessary that this kind of technology would be able to drive us and control everything at our own comfort. It has greater advantages like optimization, decision-making, and improved business strategies for satisfying the customers. Industrial IoT is a subset of IoT, which takes the concept of IoT, is applied with business scenarios, and leads to increased efficiency and greater savings. The market is highly benefited with the capability to monitor the machines remotely and monitor environmental conditions. It is not limited to specific domains; it plays a pivotal role in the field of health care by enabling patients and medical practitioners to communicate regularly in terms of the treatment, medications, and so on. This chapter is focused on the industrial use cases, which are elaborated below: Machine diagnosis systems detect faults in the machines, and also monitor the operating conditions. The performance of the machine is analyzed by comparing it with normal operating conditions. Inventory management system is used to monitor the inventor and maintain inventory level using RFID tags. Monitor the environmental conditions inside the industry by identifying toxic gases using various gas sensors, based on which hazardous zones can be identified. Hence, remedial measures can be taken by providing proper ventilation. Monitor the noise level in industry using noise monitoring stations. Noise maps are generated based on collected data. Devices in the form of wearables make remote monitoring of patients in the healthcare sector easy. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Introduction: The aim of the present review is to track the evolution of wearable IMUs from their use in supervised laboratory- and ambulatory-based settings to their application for long-term monitoring of human movement in unsupervised naturalistic settings. Areas covered: Four main emerging areas of application were identified and synthesized, namely, mobile health solutions (specifically, for the assessment of frailty, risk of falls, chronic neurological diseases, and for the monitoring and promotion of active living), occupational ergonomics, rehabilitation and telerehabilitation, and cognitive assessment. Findings from recent scientific literature in each of these areas was synthesized from an applied and/or clinical perspective with the purpose of providing clinical researchers and practitioners with practical guidance on contemporary uses of inertial sensors in applied clinical settings. Expert Opinion: IMU-based wearable devices have undergone a rapid transition from use in laboratory-based clinical practice to unsupervised, applied settings. Successful use of wearable inertial sensing for assessing mobility, motor performance and movement disorders in applied settings will rely also on machine learning algorithms for managing the vast amounts of data generated by these sensors for extracting information that is both clinically relevant and interpretable by practitioners. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Medical 4.0 is now emerging as the fourth medical revolution. It represents the applications of electronically supported Information Technology, microsystem, high level of automation, personalized therapy, and Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled intelligent devices enabled through the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). In the current scenario, the COVID-19 pandemic has a significant effect on global healthcare, and this impact is also observed in associated fields. There is a requirement for proper telehealth management and remote monitoring systems in healthcare. Medical 4.0, if implemented, can adequately handle the ongoing situation in the medical field as it will provide applications of advanced technologies to take care of the challenges of the COVID-19 outbreak. This paper studies Medical 4.0 exclusively and also in the context of COVID-19. The paper provides a brief of the significant medical revolution that has happened so far and identifies the significant supporting technologies of Medical 4.0. It also discusses the primary capabilities of Medical 4.0 for healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. The roles of Medical 4.0 in healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic are studied, and finally, this paper identifies 10 significant applications of Medical 4.0 in healthcare during COVID-19-type pandemics. We observe that the contemporary phase of development and mass-level production of intelligent medical devices has not happened in the same way as it has happened for smart electronic devices and application devices. Engineers will have a prominent role in taking up the healthcare challenges that can reach the common man. © World Scientific Publishing Co.

AB  - On account of privacy preserving issue and health-care monitoring, physiological signal biometric authentication system has gained popularity in recent years. Seismocardiogram (SCG) is now easily accessible owing to the advance of wearable sensor technology. However, SCG biometric has not been widely explored due to the challenging motion artifact removal. In this paper, we design placing the sensors at different body parts under different activities to determine the best sensor location. In addition, we develop SCG noise removal algorithm and utilize machine learning approach to perform biometric authentication tasks. We validate the proposed methods on 20 healthy young adults. The dataset contains acceleration data of sitting, standing, walking, and sitting post-exercise activities with the sensor placed at the wrists, neck, heart and sternum. We demonstrate that vertical and dorsal-ventral SCG near the heart and the sternum produce reliable SCG biometric evidenced by achieving the state-of-The-Art performance. Moreover, we present the efficacy of the devised noise removal procedure in the authentication during walking motion.Clinical relevance-A seismocardiography-based biometric authentication system can help serve privacy preserving and reveal cardiovascular functioning information in clinics.  © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Falls are one of the leading causes of permanent injury and/or disability among the elderly. When these people live alone, it is convenient that a caregiver or family member visits them periodically. However, these visits do not prevent falls when the elderly person is alone. Furthermore, in exceptional circumstances, such as a pandemic, we must avoid unnecessary mobility. This is why remote monitoring systems are currently on the rise, and several commercial solutions can be found. However, current solutions use devices attached to the waist or wrist, causing discomfort in the people who wear them. The users also tend to forget to wear the devices carried in these positions. Therefore, in order to prevent these problems, the main objective of this work is designing and recollecting a new dataset about falls, falling risks and activities of daily living using an ankle-placed device obtaining a good balance between the different activity types. This dataset will be a useful tool for researchers who want to integrate the fall detector in the footwear. Thus, in this work we design the fall-detection device, study the suitable activities to be collected, collect the dataset from 21 users performing the studied activities and evaluate the quality of the collected dataset. As an additional and secondary study, we implement a simple Deep Learning classifier based on this data to prove the system’s feasibility. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Digital health encompasses the use of information and communications technology and the use of advanced computing sciences in healthcare. This review covers the application of digital health in heart failure patients, focusing on teleconsultation, remote monitoring and apps and wearables, looking at how these technologies can be used to support care and improve outcomes. Interest in and use of these technologies, particularly teleconsultation, have been accelerated by the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Remote monitoring of heart failure patients, to identify those patients at high risk of hospitalisation and to support clinical stability, has been studied with mixed results. Remote monitoring of pulmonary artery pressure has a consistent effect on reducing hospitalisation rates for patients with moderately severe symptoms and multiparameter monitoring shows promise for the future. Wearable devices and apps are increasingly used by patients for health and lifestyle support. Some wearable technologies have shown promise in AF detection, and others may be useful in supporting self-care and guiding prognosis, but more evidence is required to guide their optimal use. Support for patients and clinicians wishing to use these technologies is important, along with consideration of data validity and privacy and appropriate recording of decision-making © RADCLIFFE CARDIOLOGY 2021

AB  - Pandemic like Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows that there is an urgent need for changing our traditional healthcare monitoring system which produces a lot of waste and pollutes the environment. At present patients need to visit a doctor/clinic to check-up their health. Due to COVID-19, there are risks for doctors and patients to be infected by COVID-19. There are many cases reported worldwide where doctors/nurses and low immunity power people are easily affected by Coronavirus. Many clinics, hospitals are not able to treat regular patients. Therefore, there is a need to change the system for healthcare monitoring. Different types of micro/nano, wearable sensors and devices are developed for diagnosing diseases. The advantages of these micro and wearable sensors are higher sensitivity, fast response and low power consumption. Other hand, Instead of bulky instruments these wearable microsensors can be embedded/attached with the patient and it can monitor the patient's health remotely. Using modern computer and electronics technology like the Internet of Things (IoT) platform (which includes computer vision, Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI), big data analysis, deep learning, machine learning and artificial intelligence), it will become a real time health monitoring system. In this chapter we will initially discuss the present day's healthcare system, followed by micro and wearable sensors used for diagnostic purposes. Further focus of the chapter will be on the electronics used for driving the sensors, devices and the collected data will be transmitted. Finally the frameworks for IoT based wearable sensors will be discussed. These IoT based wearable sensors will be a solution for sustainable healthcare systems. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021. All rights reserved.

AB  - Wearable devices as medical technologies are becoming an integral part of our lives. Many research studies are dedicated to these devices and are mainly focused on providing personal analytics, measuring physical status, and acquiring physiological signals and parameters. These continuously evolving technologies play an important role in telemedicine. Telemedicine can be broadly defined as the use of advanced telecommunications technologies to support many medical activities, such as the diagnosis, the analysis of patient data, the improvement of disease management and the treatment in remote areas. In this article, we present ATTICUS (Ambient-intelligent Tele-monitoring and Telemetry for Incepting and Catering over hUman Sustainability), an innovative remote monitoring system for ambient-assisted living based on the analysis of vital and behavioral parameters. The ATTICUS system consists of two essential components: a smart wearable—in the form of a short singlet—made of innovative textile which allows the acquisition of real-time body signals, e.g., electrocardiogram (ECG), breathing wave, temperature, and a multi-level Decision Support System (DSS), a distributed software which integrates advanced machine learning methods to automatically detect anomalies. ATTICUS is capable of operating in different application scenarios. Especially, the system will support in-home and out-home monitoring, personal check-ups, and specialized check-ups. Thus, the system will positively impact the canonical medical practices allowing simultaneous and continuous monitoring of a large number of people.

AB  - Predictive analytics in machine learning can be used in conjunction with data mining to solve real-world use cases. These techniques are proven to be highly effective and with ensemble techniques, the accuracy of machine learning models can be further improved with minimal efforts. These techniques can be used to monitor health care devices remotely. Machine learning algorithms enable us to analyze different physical parameters which are collected from health care devices. These techniques enable us to predict future health status of medical devices and with accurate results, malfunctioning of health care devices can be avoided by monitoring them remotely. The health care devices connected to IoT, allows us to collect and store huge amount of data (Physical Parameter) in the cloud, which can be fetched later using polyglot persistence (NoSQL and SQL) techniques to retrieve the data effectively and by using machine learning predictive techniques the collected data can be analyzed and the future health status of health care devices can be predicted.. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Chronic diseases are becoming more widespread. Treatment and monitoring of these diseases require going to hospitals frequently, which increases the burdens of hospitals and patients. Presently, advancements in wearable sensors and communication protocol contribute to enriching the healthcare system in a way that will reshape healthcare services shortly. Remote patient monitoring (RPM) is the foremost of these advancements. RPM systems are based on the collection of patient vital signs extracted using invasive and noninvasive techniques, then sending them in real-time to physicians. These data may help physicians in taking the right decision at the right time. The main objective of this paper is to outline research directions on remote patient monitoring, explain the role of AI in building RPM systems, make an overview of the state of the art of RPM, its advantages, its challenges, and its probable future directions. For studying the literature, five databases have been chosen (i.e., science direct, IEEE-Explore, Springer, PubMed, and science.gov). We followed the (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) PRISMA, which is a standard methodology for systematic reviews and meta-analyses. A total of 56 articles are reviewed based on the combination of a set of selected search terms including RPM, data mining, clinical decision support system, electronic health record, cloud computing, internet of things, and wireless body area network. The result of this study approved the effectiveness of RPM in improving healthcare delivery, increase diagnosis speed, and reduce costs. To this end, we also present the chronic disease monitoring system as a case study to provide enhanced solutions for RPMs. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - With the proliferation of intelligent services and applications authorized by artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things has penetrated into many aspects of our daily lives, and the medical field is no exception. The medical Internet of Things (MIoT) can be applied to wearable devices, remote diagnosis, mobile medical treatment, and remote monitoring. There is a large amount of medical information in the databases of various medical institutions. Nevertheless, due to the particularity of medical data, it is extremely related to personal privacy, and the data cannot be shared, resulting in data islands. Federated learning (FL), as a distributed collaborative artificial intelligence method, provides a solution. However, FL also involves multiple security and privacy issues. This paper proposes an adaptive Differential Privacy Federated Learning Medical IoT (DPFL-MIoT) model. Specifically, when the user updates the model locally, we propose a differential privacy federated learning deep neural network with adaptive gradient descent (DPFLAGD-DNN) algorithm, which can adaptively add noise to the model parameters according to the characteristics and gradient of the training data. Since privacy leaks often occur in downlink, we present differential privacy federated learning (DP-FL) algorithm where adaptive noise is added to the parameters when the server distributes the parameters. Our method effectively reduces the addition of unnecessary noise, and at the same time, the model has a good effect. Experimental results on real-world data show that our proposed algorithm can effectively protect data privacy.  © 2021 Lina Ni et al.

AB  - With the advent of advanced materials processing techniques, and physical sensors’ output data acquisition, transmission and processing by embedded systems through internet of things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, etc., tools are opened up many possibilities in distributed healthcare monitor, robotic process automation, smart home, etc., domains. To further augment the efficiency of these applications wearable sensors, electronic skin, smart sensors, etc., were fabricated with a variety of materials combination. Among many sensors, temperature, pressure and volume (plethysmo) sensors are widely used in healthcare to monitor vital signs: body temperature(BT), heart rate (HR), blood pressure(BP), respiration rate (RR) and oxygen saturation (Osat). These readings are called vital signs because they all must be present for life to continue. Vital signs measurement by wearable tactile/ pressure sensors for healthcare monitor are most widely researched in the recent years due to their promising application in a distributed healthcare system. Hence, it is important to understand both the basics of vital signs and their measurement by various transduction based tactile sensors in details to devise a suitable sensor for vital signs monitor. In the literature, there are many research articles on vital signs monitor by pressure sensors with qualitative data and, some times, exaggerated claims of measurements and suitability of a sensor for specific vital sign measurement. However, for real applications one need quantitative parameters of a sensor for a particular application. Thus it may worth to separate the wheat from the chaff by studying the fundamentals of vital signs, measurement requirements and limitations of measuring techniques etc., in details. This information is missing in the literature. Hence we have systematically presented the various electrical transduction based tactile or pressure sensor technologies, sensor fabrication methods, sensor characteristics modification, basics of vital signs, and measurement techniques. The past three years literature on respective vital sign measurement were also presented here. It is inferred that the tactile sensor should be highly sensitive in linear working range of 30–190 mmHg (4–25 kPa) to measure blood pressure, heart rate and respiration rate. However, the required sensitivity value is not yet determined for each of the above measurements, in the literature. Both resistance and capacitance tactile sensors’ sensitivity and linear working range can be enhanced by employing biomimetic surface microstructures, 3D porous microstructures, intrafillable microstructures, metallic fillers, ionic liquids, etc., The details of each method is described in the article under suitable section. It is still a great challenge to simultaneously achieve high sensitivity, wide linear working range, excellent stability in a sensor for meeting the requirements of full-scale healthcare monitoring from subtle deformations (due to blood pulse, and cheek occlusion) to large deformations (due to finger bending and pressing). © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Recent advances in Internet-of-Things technology have opened the doors to new scenarios for biosensor applications. Flexibility, portability, and remote control and access are of utmost importance to move these devices to people's homes or in a Point-of-Care context and rapidly share the results with users and their physicians. In this paper, an innovative portable device for both quantitative and semi-quantitative electrochemical analysis is presented. This device can operate autonomously without the need of relying on other devices (e.g., PC, tablets, or smartphones) thanks to built-in Wi-Fi connectivity. The developed hardware is integrated into a cloud-based platform, exploiting the cloud computational power to perform innovative algorithms for calibration (e.g., Machine Learning tools). Results and configurations can be accessed through a web page without the installation of dedicated APPs or software. The electrical input/output characteristic was measured with a dummy cell as a load, achieving excellent linearity. Furthermore, the device response to five different concentrations of potassium ferri/ferrocyanide redox probe was compared with a bench-top laboratory instrument. No difference in analytical sensitivity was found. Also, some examples of application-specific tests were set up to demonstrate the use in real-case scenarios. In addition, Support Vector Machine algorithm was applied to semi-quantitative analyses to classify the input samples into four classes, achieving an average accuracy of 98.23%. Finally, COVID-19 related tests are presented and discussed. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - In healthcare, physical activity can be monitored in two ways: self‐monitoring by the patient himself or external monitoring by health professionals. Regarding self‐monitoring, wearable activity trackers allow automated passive data collection that educate and motivate patients. Wearing an activity tracker can improve walking time by around 1500 steps per day. However, there are concerns about measurement accuracy (e.g., lack of a common validation protocol or measurement discrepancies between different devices). For external monitoring, many innovative electronic tools are currently used in rheumatology to help support physician time management, to reduce the burden on clinic time, and to prioritize patients who may need further attention. In inflammatory arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis, regular monitoring of patients to detect disease flares improves outcomes. In a pilot study applying machine learning to activity tracker steps, we showed that physical activity was strongly linked to disease flares and that patterns of physical activity could be used to predict flares with great accuracy, with a sensitivity and specificity above 95%. Thus, automatic monitoring of steps may lead to improved disease control through potential early identification of disease flares. However, activity trackers have some limitations when applied to rheumatic patients, such as tracker adherence, lack of clarity on long‐term effectiveness, or the potential multiplicity of trackers. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Digital technologies are transforming society and our way of life. The Covid- 19 emergency has further accelerated this transformation, making available remote services that have replaced those we used to use in presence. This transformation has given a further boost to digital health. Many services for telemedicine in all its forms (remote televisit, telehealth, telerehabilitation, telemonitoring) are now available and in some cases can be prescribed and reimbursed by national health systems or insurance companies. Apps and wearables are increasingly used to collect health data and can help promote healthy lifestyles, disseminate information for the prevention and management of certain diseases, involve the patient in treatment, and improve adherence to therapy and doctor-patient communication. Digital therapeutics, providing software that modify lifestyles and deliver cognitive-behavioural interventions, offer therapeutic interventions based on solid scientific evidence to prevent, manage, or treat a wide range of physical, mental and behavioural conditions. Artificial intelligence and machine learning systems help to analyse and interpret data produced in the medical field to create diagnostic and predictive systems, systems for defining the best treatment to administer to a patient, and systems for identifying new drugs. It is essential, however, that digital health tools be rigorously tested and regulated before widespread adoption, as is the case with normal medical devices and drug therapies.

AB  - Conductive hydrogels as wearable devices meet the basic demands of mechanical flexibility and smart sensing. However, achieving a combination of adequate skin adhesion, long-term stability and visible human-sensor interface are still challengeable. Here, a simple and effective strategy was proposed to fabricate “all-in-one” hydrolyzed keratin protein-modified polyacrylamide composite hydrogel transducer. Hydrolyzed keratin endowed hydrogel with lower modulus and ultra-stretchability to minimize wearing-related tension and discomfort. Specially, robust skin adhesion was obtained to achieve precise sensing without delamination. Impressively, the hydrogel had high transparency and exhibited wide-range temperature tolerance (−20 °C to 50 °C). Besides, the hydrogel with stable conductivity was extremely sensitive to pressure and strain at a wide range. As a result, the obtained transducer could not only detect human motion, respiratory mode and vocal-cord vibration, but also identify handwriting and facial expression. This work shed a new light on the design of next-generation skin-like electronic devices with applications in human-machine interface, ionic skin, artificial intelligence and healthcare monitoring. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Electronic health is the jargon moving around the healthcare sector. Patient record maintenance in digital format popularly called as electonic health record (EHR). EHR holds information about patients’ demographics, track of visits, and treatments. Information about the patients could be retrieved very shortly and accurately due to digitalization. Another main area to be considered is monitoring and tracking of the sick from the remote. It’s the great challenge facing the present scenario. The global life expectancy has increased swiftly and opened an avenue for a higher level of research that integrates human and machine intelligence. Smart devices from the word clearly indicate the way of its working and performance. The number of industries joint hands with researchers especially doctors and engineers to build the devices that are ergonomically mapping and serving the purpose of providing healthcare to the sick. In our work, we discussed the smart way of handling the alarming neurodegenerative disease named Parkinson’s. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Automated daily living activity recognition is a relevant task since it allows to assess the health status of a subject both objectively and remotely. Having a reliable measure is important since it gives precise indications to doctors and researchers interested in evaluating the effectiveness of treatments or drugs (e.g., in the context of clinical stud-ies). The possibility to perform this task remotely is more convenient for the patients and acquired increasing importance not only due to the current pandemic, but also because of the regularly growing population of elderly people that could benefit from remote monitoring. In this paper, first, we describe a novel wearable-device-based dataset that contains data (1) of a high number of daily life activities, coming from a real-life scenario, (2) recorded by applying multiple devices on different parts of the body, and (3) recorded with medical-grade devices at a high sampling frequency. Then, second, we describe a machine learning-based method for activity recognition. Our approach takes in input a dataset and through multiple phases allows to recognise the activities performed by the subjects with a good degree of accuracy (up to 0.92 expressed as F1 score depending on the location). © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

AB  - Digital health is tied to connecting points of care electronically. Medical data can be shared and stored securely; hence, monitoring and securing access to personal data can be controlled. Due to the significant advancement of technology, digital healthcare is becoming more sophisticated and vulnerable. This chapter aims to observe the impact of information technology on the digital health paradigm, especially Internet of Things (IoT) in telehealth, or Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). The data is extracted from 30 peer-reviewed publications that discussed security issues, security attacks, sensors/wearable devices, data storage, programming languages, encryption and cryptographic algorithms, transmission media, techniques/mechanism, standards/legislation/principles, methodologies/models, implementation platforms and frameworks proposed to enhance the security of digital health systems. Our results demonstrate that the healthcare sector is experiencing data breaches due to unauthorized access for medical data. Furthermore, results show that unauthorized access led to creating other security issues such as the modification and injection of messages into the network, the changing of codes, and data leakage. Digital health solutions are capable of care management, advancing patients’ health, increasing patients’ satisfaction and promoting preventive care. Information security specialists and the government need to pay more attention to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of patients’ highly sensitive medical data. The increasingly tight connection between artificial Intelligence, machine learning, robotics to digital health was not taken into account in this analysis. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has brought unexpected new scenarios in patient-care journeys and has accelerated this innovative process in the healthcare sector, demonstrating the importance of a systemic rethinking of remote care, mostly when patients are discharged from the hospital and continue their therapies at home in autonomy. The possibility to remotely monitor patients at home by means of smart sensors and medical devices has a dramatic impact on the quality of health services. Situation awareness plays an essential role in the decision-making process about the users, patients in this case, and their behaviors. Leveraging an Edge Computing framework, with embedded Artificial Intelligence capabilities to process near real-time data gathered from connected smart devices, would provide automatic decision support, thus improving the physicians’ course of action. In this paper we introduce, within an Edge AI framework, a dedicated module, called Clinical Pathway Adherence Checker (CPAC), which identifies the discrepancies between the modeled clinical pathway and the observed one by means of process mining techniques, and hence detecting early clinical deterioration of patient conditions. Also, further analyses are conducted in the anomaly detection at the Edge that may occur during the health data transmission process. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - High-performance wearable electronics show great potential in the soft robotics, artificial intelligence, human–machine interaction, health care, etc. Due to the wide application in heart rate detection, voice monitoring, and sports data collection, the pressure sensor has grasped a lot of attention. However, poor cycle stability, low sensitivity and narrow working pressure range hinder the further development of the pressure sensors. To solve the above mentioned problems, a polyurethane-based conductive sponge is prepared via silver nanoparticle coating after the in-situ synthesis of poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) on the backbones of polyurethane foam. The flexible pressure sensor exhibits excellent performance, including ultrahigh sensitivity (3.039 kPa−1), wide working range (0–35 kPa), frequency-independent performance, reliable repeatability (~ 1000 cycles), rapid and stable response. Finally, we successfully demonstrated these flexible sensors in detecting tiny physiological activities and human motions. All the results demonstrate that the the polyurethane-based pressure sensor is a promising candidate for soft electronics and healthcare monitoring. © 2021, The Polymer Society, Taipei.

AB  - Ever-evolving advances in flexible magnetic sensors are promising to fuel technological developments in the fields of touchless human-machine interaction, implantable medical diagnosis, and magnetoreception for artificial intelligence. However, the realization of highly flexible and extremely sensitive magnetic sensors remains a challenge. Here, we report a cost-effective, flexible, and ultra-sensitive heterostructural magnetoelectric (ME) sensor consisting of piezoelectric Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 (PZT) thick films and Metglas foils. The flexible sensor exhibits a strong ME coefficient of 19.3 V cm-1 Oe-1 at low frequencies and 280.5 V cm-1 Oe-1 at resonance due to the exceptionally high piezoelectric coefficient d33 ∼72 pC N-1 of the constituent PZT thick films. The flexible ME sensor possesses not only ultrahigh sensitivities of 200 nT at low frequencies and 200 pT at resonance but also shows an excellent mechanical endurance. Through 5000 bending cycles (radii of ∼1 cm), the sensors showed no fatigue-induced performance degradation. This ultrasensitive flexible sensor provides a platform capable of sensing and responding to external magnetic fields and will find applications in soft robotics, wearable healthcare monitoring, and consumer electronics.  © 2021 Author(s).

AB  - The most highlighted international slogan of the year 2020 is “Stay Home; Stay Safe.” The Internet of Things (IoT) has bridged the gap between the physical world and digital world in the COVID-19 outbreak. It provides a promising solution to the modern health issues with its technological, social, and economic prospects. Due to the rapid increase in confirmed cases through laboratory tests, this technological advancement helps the people to protect themselves from the infections. Even when the persons become the victims of COVID-19, the Internet of Things-based healthcare devices help in remote monitoring during quarantine, in order to prevent more infections among the public. However, numerous fake news are busting in a day-to-day basis about COVID-19, and security concerns on patient’s data are at risk. Artificial intelligence and blockchain technologies are explored to address these challenges further; a major review is outlined on various aspects such as Internet of Health Things, Internet of Medical Things, telemedicine, and Internet of Medical Things Industry Status. This chapter proposes a new category, “Internet of Covid Things,” along with their challenges. Mobile applications which will assist almost all people and the industry aspects on manufacturing the medical devices are also included in the review framework. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

AB  - Introduction There is an outbreak of COVID-19 worldwide. As there is no effective therapy or vaccine yet, rigorous implementation of traditional public health measures such as isolation and quarantine remains the most effective tool to control the outbreak. When an asymptomatic individual with COVID-19 exposure is being quarantined, it is necessary to perform temperature and symptom surveillance. As such surveillance is intermittent in nature and highly dependent on self-discipline, it has limited effectiveness. Advances in biosensor technologies made it possible to continuously monitor physiological parameters using wearable biosensors with a variety of form factors. Objective To explore the potential of using wearable biosensors to continuously monitor multidimensional physiological parameters for early detection of COVID-19 clinical progression. Method This randomised controlled open-labelled trial will involve 200-1000 asymptomatic subjects with close COVID-19 contact under mandatory quarantine at designated facilities in Hong Kong. Subjects will be randomised to receive a remote monitoring strategy (intervention group) or standard strategy (control group) in a 1:1 ratio during the 14 day-quarantine period. In addition to fever and symptom surveillance in the control group, subjects in the intervention group will wear wearable biosensors on their arms to continuously monitor skin temperature, respiratory rate, blood pressure, pulse rate, blood oxygen saturation and daily activities. These physiological parameters will be transferred in real time to a smartphone application called Biovitals Sentinel. These data will then be processed using a cloud-based multivariate physiology analytics engine called Biovitals to detect subtle physiological changes. The results will be displayed on a web-based dashboard for clinicians' review. The primary outcome is the time to diagnosis of COVID-19. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been obtained from institutional review boards at the study sites. Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions. Published by BMJ.

AB  - Human activity recognition (HAR) based on wearable sensors has emerged as an active topic of research in machine learning and human behavior analysis because of its applications in several fields, including health, security and surveillance, and remote monitoring. Machine learning algorithms are frequently applied in HAR systems to learn from labeled sensor data. The effectiveness of these algorithms generally relies on having access to lots of accurately labeled training data. But labeled data for HAR is hard to come by and is often heavily imbalanced in favor of one or other dominant classes, which in turn leads to poor recognition performance.In this study we introduce a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based approach for HAR that we use to automatically synthesize balanced and realistic sensor data. GANs are robust generative networks, typically used to create synthetic images that cannot be distinguished from real images. Here we explore and construct a model for generating several types of human activity sensor data using a Wasserstein GAN (WGAN). We assess the synthetic data using two commonly-used classifier models, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). We evaluate the quality and diversity of the synthetic data by training on synthetic data and testing on real sensor data, and vice versa. We then use synthetic sensor data to oversample the imbalanced training set. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method on two publicly available human activity datasets, the Sussex-Huawei Locomotion (SHL) and Smoking Activity Dataset (SAD). We achieve improvements of using WGAN augmented training data over the imbalanced case, for both SHL (0.85 to 0.95 F1-score), and for SAD (0.70 to 0.77 F1-score) when using a CNN activity classifier. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - High-performance stretchable and wearable electronic skins (e-skins) with high sensitivity and large sensing range are urgently required with the rapid development of internet of things and artificial intelligence. Herein, a simple and efficient “dip coating” method was proposed for preparing flexible pressure sensors based on the combination of silicone rubber (SR) and carbonized melamine sponge (CMS). From the as-prepared flexible sensor, good stability, mechanical performances, anti-interference ability, wide working range (0–550 kPa), fast response (~120 ms), frequency-dependent performance, reliable repeatability (~10000 cycle) and stable signal waveform output can be readily obtained. This CMS-based flexible pressure sensor can not only detect human motion (finger bending, knee squatting-arising and plantar pressure changing) in real time and reliably, but also detect the pressure distribution in space through arraying. The experimental results demonstrate that the flexible pressure sensor based on functional-sponge can be a promising candidate for healthcare monitoring and wearable electronics in artificial intelligence. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Enormous growth is seen in the field of information technology and communication technology which enable the Internet of Things (IoT) technology on the boon. Nowadays, IoT technology is very common and widely used in all areas. It is also expanding its wing day by day. At the end of 2019, IoT devices will reach to 26.66 billion. Due to wide and diverse use of IoT technology, a large amount of valuable data is generated which gives researchers to deal with the huge amounts of real-time data. Machine learning plays a vital role in making a IoT environment, but it is a very complex task to build a smart environment. For personal healthcare monitoring, IoT-based sensors and mobiles devices play a crucial role in the betterment of the human lifestyle. Wearable sensor technology which is incorporated with mobile devices is more commonly used in monitoring personal health and well-being. In this research work, we examine the capability and performance of machine learning algorithms over the built-human activity recognition (HAR) dataset. Based on the performance evaluation results, gradient boosting classifier (GBC), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), bagging classifier (BAG), classification and regression trees (CART), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and extra trees classifier (ETC) algorithms have the better accuracy and suitable for real IoT datasets. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2020.

AB  - The ubiquitous usage of wearable IoT (wIoT) devices has created a formidable opportunity for remote health monitoring system to provide paramount services such as preventive care and early intervention for populations at risk. The cloud-edge paradigm can efficiently manifest the complex computations required in providing these services. But the challenge in its exertion lies in incorporating intelligence at the edge devices. With the deluge of data availability, deep learning methods are very promising to obtain sufficient performance in healthcare applications. As the edge devices are resource-constrained in terms of compute capability and energy consumption, unleashing deep learning services from the cloud to the edge requires efficient tackling of the exorbitant computational and energy requirements of deep learning frameworks. In this chapter, an energy-efficient smart edge based health care support system (EESE-HSS) is proposed for diabetic patients with cardiovascular disease. The proposed cloud-edge paradigm makes use of a hierarchical computing architecture for exerting expeditious diagnosis during emergencies. The intelligence framework incorporated at the edge is also built in an energy-efficient manner. Thus, the proposed healthcare support system has better efficacy in terms of energy efficiency and reduced latency. This makes it very supportive for fall detection in diabetic patients with cardiovascular disease who are susceptible to the risk of heart attack, stroke, heart failure and other vicious diseases. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The growing desire for better control of health outcomes and the increasing healthcare costs associated with disease treatment has led to a shift in the healthcare paradigm from reactive to proactive. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI), the study of intelligent machines that maximize their likelihood of achieving a goal, and the rise of mobile health technologies (e.g., wearable devices and smartphone applications) have enabled healthcare to take place outside of the traditional clinical setting. In this chapter, we detail how AI algorithms can improve wellness assessment, aid in personalizing intervention strategies to promote healthier lifestyle behaviors, and uncover previously unknown disease risk factors. Organized across three dimensions of wellness (physical, mental, and social), this chapter highlights studies that utilize AI to incorporate new data sources or reinterpret preexisting data sources to further advance preventative medicine. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Medical facilities and technologies have been greatly improved through the application of biosensors, healthcare systems, health diagnosis and disease prevention technologies. However, wireless transmission and deep learning neural network are essential applications and new methods in biomedical engineering nowadays. Hence, authors established a new real-time and intelligent healthcare system that will help the physician’s diagnosis over the patient’s condition and will have a great contribution to medical research. Physiological conditions can be monitored and primary diagnosis will be determined which will help people primarily for personal health care. This paper focused on the collection, transmission, and analysis of physiological signals captured from biosensors with the application of deep learning and segmented analysis for the prediction of heart diseases. Biosensors employed were non-invasive composed of infrared body temperature sensor (MLX90614), heart rate and blood oxygen sensor (MAX30100) and ECG sensor (AD8232). This research used these biosensors to collect signals integrated with Arduino UNO as a central module to process and analyze those signals. ESP8266 Wi-Fi microchip was used to transmit digitized result signals to the database for deep learning analysis. The first segment of deep learning analysis is the Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network applied for the temperature, heart rate and arterial oxygen saturation prediction. A rolled training technique was used to provide accurate predictions in this segment. The second segment used was the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which comprises three hidden layers to analyze the ECG signals from the image datasets. Deep learning tools used were the powerful python language, python based Anaconda, Google’s TensorFlow and open source neural network library Keras. The algorithm was used for evaluation using the available MIT-BIH ECG database from Physionet databases which attained 99.05% accuracy and arrived at only 4.96% loss rate after 30 training steps. The implementation of the system is comprised of physiological parameter sensing system, the wireless transmission system and the deep neural network prediction system. User interfaces were also developed such as the LCD display which shows values of body temperature, heart rate and arterial oxygen saturation level. Web page and app were created to allow users or doctors for visual presentations of the results of analysis. The webpage contains information about the system, deep learning networks used, biosensors and the historical graph of about the patient’s body temperature, heart rate and oxygen saturation. It also indicates the normal ranges of the physiological parameters. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - In this paper we proposed a wearable electrocardiogram (ECG) telemonitoring system for atrial fibrillation (AF) detection based on a smartphone and cloud computing. A wearable ECG patch was designed to collect ECG signals and send the signals to an Android smartphone via Bluetooth. An Android APP was developed to display the ECG waveforms in real time and transmit every 30 s ECG data to a remote cloud server. A machine learning (CatBoost)-based ECG classification method was proposed to detect AF in the cloud server. In case of detected AF, the cloud server pushed the ECG data and classification results to the web browser of a doctor. Finally, the Android APP displayed the doctor’s diagnosis for the ECG signals. Experimental results showed the proposed CatBoost classifier trained with 17 selected features achieved an overall F1 score of 0.92 on the test set (n = 7270). The proposed wearable ECG monitoring system may potentially be useful for long-term ECG telemonitoring for AF detection. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Flexible and portable pressure sensors with highly sensitive and cost-effective attributes are of great demand in wearable electronics, biomedical monitoring, and artificial intelligence. To realize portable pressure sensors with mobile operation, ultrathin, flexible, and sustainable power sources are highly desired. Here, a self-powered wearable pressure sensing system is developed by integrating a conductive elastomer-based pressure sensor with a flexible thin-film thermoelectric generator (tf-TEG) to harvest body heat. Laser engraving technique is adopted to achieve pressure sensor with tunable sensitivity through the controllable design of surface microstructures. To produce a reliable and renewable power supply for the pressure sensor, the flexible tf-TEG is constructed with high thermal-conductivity insulation films for heat absorbing and flexible hydrogels as heat sink, resulting in a large temperature gradient for high power generation. In particular, the pressure sensitivity of the self-powered system is independent of the temperature gradient across the tf-TEG, allowing it to maintain a stable performance under various temperature differences between human skin and surroundings. For the first time, the self-powered pressure sensing system proposed in this work enables continuous monitoring of human physiological signals and body motions entirely powered by the skin-attachable tf-TEG without an electronic boost circuitry. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - eHealth is the use of modern information and communication technology (ICT) for trans-institutional healthcare purposes. Important subtopics of eHealth are health data sharing and telemedicine. Most of the clinical documentation to be shared is collected in patient records to support patient care. More sophisticated approaches to electronic patient records are trans-institutional or (inter-)national. Other aims for clinical documentation are quality management, reimbursement, legal issues, and medical research. Basic prerequisite for eHealth is interoperability, which can be divided into technical, semantic and process interoperability. There is a variety of international standards to support interoperability. Telemedicine is a subtopic of eHealth, which bridges spatial distance by using ICT for medical (inter-)actions. We distinguish telemedicine among healthcare professionals and telemedicine between health care professionals and patients. Both have a great potential to face the challenges of aging societies, the increasing number of chronically ill patients, multimorbidity and low number of physicians in remote areas. With ongoing digitalization more and more data are available digitally. Clinical documentation is an important source for big data analysis and artificial intelligence. The patient has an important role: Telemonitoring, wearable technologies, and smart home devices provide digital health data from daily life. These are high-quality data which can be used for medical decisions. © 2020 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - The widespread adoption of wearable devices and social media is generating population-scale data about people's behavior as situated in their everyday lives. In this paper, an embedded Cyber-Human System (CHS) is used to monitor a person's mental health via physiological, behavioral, and social data. These three data streams will then be relayed to an application used by a professional within the medical industry, to allow remote monitoring of the user's mental health without the uncertainty that face-to-face interviews can introduce. Experimentation and verification have been conducted on a group of test subjects with different test scenarios including a happy, sad, angry, and neutral state of being. We propose to use physiological data to predict a person's emotional state using a machine learning classification algorithm. The proposed system can distinguish between the different emotional states with an accuracy of 92.9%. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Flexible, wearable and breathable pressure sensors have received tremendous interest for various potential applications in wearable electronic skins, intelligent robotics, healthcare biomonitoring, and artificial intelligence. However, it remains a critical challenge to simultaneously achieve high sensitivity, broad sensing range, excellent mechanical stability, fast response/recovery, and reliable breathability for long-term wearing for ultrasensitive comfortable full-scale biomonitoring. Herein, we present a wearable, highly sensitive, broad-range and breathable pressure sensor by sandwiching the interconnected nanocomposites of carbonized metal-organic framework (C-MOF) and polyaniline nanofiber (PANIF) on polyurethane (PU) sponge (C-MOF/PANIF@PU) between a breathable fabric and an interdigitated electrode-coated fabric. The assembled sensor exhibits a broad sensing range (up to 60 kPa), high sensitivity (158.26 kPa−1), fast response/recovery time (22 ms/20 ms), reliable breathability, wireless biomonitoring, and an excellent repeatability over 15,000 cycles. It can be assembled as smart artificial electronic skins (E-skins) for mapping tactile stimuli. This work paves the way for the design of wearable, breathable, highly sensitive and broad-range pressure sensor with potential versatile applications in next-generation artificial skins, personal healthcare monitoring, clinical diagnosis, and human-machine interactions. © 2020

AB  - Modern Smart Health Systems (SHS) involve the concept of connected personal medical devices. These devices significantly improve the patient's lifestyle as they permit remote monitoring and transmission of health data (i.e., telemedicine), lowering the treatment costs for both the patient and the healthcare providers. Although specific SHS communication standards (i.e., ISO/IEEE 11073) enable real-time plug-and-play interoperability and communication between different personal medical devices, they do not specify any features for secure communications. In this paper, we demonstrate how personal medical device communication is indeed vulnerable to different cyber attacks. Specifically, we show how an external attacker can hook into the personal medical device's communication and eavesdrop the sensitive health data traffic, and implement manin-the-middle, replay, false data injection, and denial-of-service attacks. Furthermore, we also propose an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), HEKA, to monitor personal medical device traffic and detect attacks on them. HEKA passively hooks into the personal medical traffic generated by medical devices to learn the contiguous sequence of packets information from the captured traffic and detects irregular traffic-flow patterns using an n-grambased approach and different machine learning techniques. We implemented HEKA in a testbed consisting of eight off-the-shelf personal medical devices and evaluated its performance against four different attacks. Our extensive evaluation shows that HEKA can effectively detect different attacks on personal medical devices with an accuracy of 98.4% and Fl-score of 98%. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) is making strong advances in healthcare with the promise of transformation in technological, social and economic prospects, paving the way for a healthy future. Medical devices equipped with wireless communication enable remote monitoring features and are increasingly becoming connected to each other and to the Internet. Such smart and connected medical devices referred to as the Internet of Medical Things have enabled continuous real-time patient monitoring, increase in diagnostic accuracy, and effective treatment. In spite of their numerous benefits, these devices open up newer attack surfaces thereby introducing multitude of security and privacy concerns. Attacks on Internet connected medical devices can potentially cause significant physical harm and life-threatening damage to the patients. In this research, we design and develop a novel mobile agent based intrusion detection system to secure the network of connected medical devices. In particular, the proposed system is hierarchical, autonomous, and employs machine learning and regression algorithms to detect network level intrusions as well as anomalies in sensor data. We simulate a hospital network topology and perform detailed experiments for various subsets of Internet of Medical things including wireless body area networks and other connected medical devices. Our simulation results demonstrate that we are able to achieve high detection accuracy with minimal resource overhead. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

AB  - In the Healthcare 4.0 era, recent breakthroughs in emerging and disruptive technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), machine learning and robotics, have significantly changed the way in which healthcare services are delivered to patients. Advancements in patient monitoring systems and wearable devices have created more powerful and flexible real-time remote patient observation. Healthcare provision has experienced remarkable improvements facilitated by cloud computing and wireless technologies, while wireless sensor networks now play an important role in mobile technologies for e-healthcare. In this paper, we propose a mobile-based healthcare system for the Healthcare 4.0 era. The proposed approach enables patients to self-authenticate, using their own mobile and wearable devices, establishing a session key between owned devices. After mutual authentication, the cloud server verifies each user. The security of the approach is described through the AVISPA tool. We analyze the embedded security and functionality which improves the healthcare system and calculate the relative communication and computation costs. Results show that the proposed approach provides greater security compared to other state-of-the-art schemes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Wearable electronics and smart garments have attracted increasing attention due to their potential application in health care monitoring, artificial intelligence, soft robotics, etc. However, designing robust and flexible wearable electronics that can shield electromagnetic waves and work in all-weather environment or even harsh conditions remains a challenge. Herein, superhydrophobic and multi-responsive fabric composites with outstanding electro-photo-thermal effect and excellent electromagnetic interference shielding (EMI) performance are fabricated by decoration of conductive Ag nanoparticles onto the oxygen plasma treated polypropylene (PP) fabric, followed by multiple spray-coating with a mixture of Fe3O4 nanoparticles/polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The obtained fabric composites exhibit high conductivity (up to 108.8 S/cm) and the EMI shielding effectiveness (SE) can reach as high as ~56.1 dB in the X band, in which of the incident electromagnetic waves can account for 30%. Moreover, the PDMS coating not only improves the interface adhesion between the nanoparticles and fibers, but also endows the fabric composites with superhydrophobicity, leading to an excellent self-cleaning performance. Surprisingly, the fabric composites also exhibit multiple responsive properties to electron and light, known as electro-photo-thermal effect, which can be maintained during mechanical deformations and cold environment. This work opens a new avenue for next-generation of wearable electronics with multi-functionality. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - ICT4MOMs project aims at implementing a novel remote ICT service towards the monitoring and prediction of maternal and fetal conditions throughout pregnancy. The envisioned application is based on the integration of wearable sensors and devices connected by an ad-hoc smartphone app in communication with an ob-gyn clinical center. Advanced signal and image processing software tools will be developed for extracting information from the recorded signals, namely: fetal heart rate, uterine contractions, continuous glucose sensors and portable US probe. Once validated by the clinical partners, the collected dataset will be used for a multivariate analysis based on soft computing classifiers and machine learning techniques. Based on the growing literature providing evidence on the fact that mother-fetus system should be considered as a whole, in this proposal pregnancy is conceptualized as a continuously evolving system which needs to be investigated by means of time-varying approaches. The crucial expected outcome is the integration of the established clinical knowledge with the results of computational analysis. Such multilevel integration is expected to provide reliable and translatable clinical guidelines towards a novel pregnancy management encompassing a more inclusive monitoring framework designed on a patient-specific level.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide a model for prediction of respiratory symptoms in the progression of COVID-19, social distancing, frequent hand washes, wearing of face mask in public are some of the potential measures of preventing the disease from further spreading. In spite of the effects and efforts taken by governments, the pandemic is still uncontrolled in major cities of the world. The proposed technique in this paper introduces a non-intrusive and major screening of vital symptoms and changes in the respiratory organs. Design/methodology/approach: The novel coronavirus or Covid-19 has become a serious threat to social and economic growth of many nations worldwide. The pace of progression was significantly higher in the past two months. Identified by severe respiratory illness, fever and coughs, the disease has been threatening the lives of human society. Early detection and prognosis is absolutely necessary to isolate the potential spreaders of the disease and to control the rate of progression. Findings: Recent studies have highlighted the changes observed in breathing characteristics of infected patients. Respiratory pattern of Covid-19 patients can be differentiated from the respiratory pattern of normal cold/flu affected patients. Tachypnoea is one among the vital signs identified to be distinguishing feature of Covid-19. The proposed respiratory data capture will commence with facial recognition, use of infrared sensors and machine-learning approaches to classify the respiratory patterns, which finally narrows down as a symptom of Covid-19. Originality/value: Proposed system produced outcome of 94% accuracy, precision, recall and a F1-measure as an average in the conducted experiments. This method also proves to be a fruitful solution for large-scale monitoring and categorisation of people based on the symptoms. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Management of shoulder pathologies involves measurement of range of motion (ROM) as well as assessing the quality and efficiency of that motion using different clinical tests. This work describes the preliminary results of using a smart watch to capture the direction of movement, velocity and ROM of the shoulder joint. ROM is the available amount of movement of a joint in different directions which can be either passive, active or active assisted. With the collected dataset and the proposed method, ROM could be estimated with a 9° error. Shoulder function or motion identification was validated by two different methods: i) rule engine and ii) machine learning approach. Rule base engine method was able to successfully identify the motions with accuracy of 91.94% and ML method with 10-Fold Validation reported a best performance of 94.17%. Proposed method, currently tested for some active motions of the shoulder, has the potential to be a very useful assist in quantifying and monitoring rehabilitation of the shoulder joint in multiple clinical situations.  © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Smart wearables help real-time and remote monitoring of health data for effective diagnostic and preventive health care services. Wearable devices have the ability to track and monitor healthcare vitals such as heart rate, physical activities, BMI (Body Mass Index), blood pressure, and keeps an individual notified about the health status. Artificial Intelligence-enabled wearables show an ability to transform the health insurance sector. This would not only enable self-management of individual health but also help them focus from treatments to the preventions of health hazards. With this customer-centric approach to health care, it will enable the insurance companies to track the health behaviour of the individuals. This can perhaps lead to better incentivization models with a lower premium to the health-centric customers. Health insurance companies can have better outreach with these customer-centric products. The area is exceptionally novel and shows potential for the research opportunities. Although the literature shows the presence of few works incepting the application of smart wearables in health insurance, it was found that the works are across sections of the society and extremely limited to regions and boundaries. Thus, a need for Bibliometric survey in the area of Smart Wearables in Health insurance is necessary to track the research trends, progress and scope of the future research. This paper conducts Bibliometric study for “Smart Wearables in Health Insurance Industry” by extracting documents of total 287 from Scopus database using keywords like wearables, health insurance, health care, machine learning and health risk prediction. The study is conducted since the last decade that is 2011-2020 for the research analysis. From the study, it is observed that application of wearables in health insurance are in a nascent stage and there is a scope for researchers, insurance, health care stakeholders to explore the used cases for a better user experience.  © 2020, Library Philosophy and Practice (e-journal).

AB  - Nano-scaled structures, wireless sensing, wearable devices, and wireless communications systems are anticipated to support the development of new next-generation technologies in the near future. Exponential rise in future Radio-Frequency (RF) sensing systems have demonstrated its applications in areas such as wearable consumer electronics, remote healthcare monitoring, wireless implants, and smart buildings. In this paper, we propose a novel, non-wearable, device-free, privacy-preserving Wi-Fi imaging-based occupancy detection system for future smart buildings. The proposed system is developed using off-the-shelf non-wearable devices such as Wi-Fi router, network interface card, and an omnidirectional antenna for future body centric communication. The core idea is to detect presence of person along its activities of daily living without deploying a device on person's body. TheWi-Fi signals received using non-wearable devices are converted into time-frequency scalograms. The occupancy is detected by classifying the scalogram images using an auto-encoder neural network. In addition to occupancy detection, the deep neural network also identifies the activity performed by the occupant. Moreover, a novel encryption algorithm using Chirikov and Intertwining map-based is also proposed to encrypt the scalogram images. This feature enables secure storage of scalogram images in a database for future analysis. The classification accuracy of the proposed scheme is 91.1%. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Digitization of healthcare will be a major innovation driver in the coming decade. Also, enabled by technological advancements and electronics miniaturization, wearable health device (WHD) applications are expected to grow exponentially. This, in turn, may make 4P medicine (predictive, precise, preventive and personalized) a more attainable goal within dialysis patient care. This article discusses different use cases where WHD could be of relevance for dialysis patient care, i.e. measurement of heart rate, arrhythmia detection, blood pressure, hyperkalaemia, fluid overload and physical activity. After adequate validation of the different WHD in this specific population, data obtained from WHD could form part of a body area network (BAN), which could serve different purposes such as feedback on actionable parameters like physical inactivity, fluid overload, danger signalling or event prediction. For a BAN to become clinical reality, not only must technical issues, cybersecurity and data privacy be addressed, but also adequate models based on artificial intelligence and mathematical analysis need to be developed for signal optimization, data representation, data reliability labelling and interpretation. Moreover, the potential of WHD and BAN can only be fulfilled if they are part of a transformative healthcare system with a shared responsibility between patients, healthcare providers and the payors, using a step-up approach that may include digital assistants and dedicated 'digital clinics'. The coming decade will be critical in observing how these developments will impact and transform dialysis patient care and will undoubtedly ask for an increased 'digital literacy' for all those implicated in their care. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Body motion is essential to our daily lives, and partly reflects our health. With the ubiquitous spread of mobile and wearable devices having built-in micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) sensors, acquisition of linear acceleration and angular velocity of personal gait is much easier today. These data can reveal different types of human movement as well as possible abnormalities. This study introduces an approach to collecting and processing human gait data, transforming these data into images and leveraging deep learning technique for the classification task. Features of three-dimensional linear acceleration are re-orientated and decomposed into various frequency components and characteristic waveforms by Zao and Lu method. Then, the summary of these characteristic waveforms produces a feature data set with four classes of human gait motion: walking, jogging, climbing upstairs, and going downstairs. We show promising results with the use of a convolutional neural network and a traditional neural network on the refined feature data. From this study, applications such as tele-monitoring, tele-rehabilitation, and assessing sedentary habits can be implemented to diagnose and intervene in human behavior.

AB  - Human activity recognition is gaining increasing importance because of its implication in remote monitoring application including security, health and fitness apps. This paper provides an analysis of different machine learning techniques for recognizing human activity. Firstly, all the recent work related to human activity recognition using accelerometer data is analyzed and presented in the paper. In this study the accelerometer used in smartphones as well as those embedded in wearable devices are compared and recognition methodologies applied on both the devices are presented. The dataset used in this project is a transformed version of 'Activity Recognition using Cell Phone Accelerometers,' by the Wireless Sensor Data Mining WSDM. Some important features were extracted from the data and based on it different models were assessed using Matlab Classification Learner App. Four distinct machine learning techniques were applied on the dataset, namely, linear regression, logistic regression, support vector machine and neural network. For the purposed of applying classifier Weka tool is used. The results of these algorithms are compared and presented in the form of tables and graphs and Bagged Tree is identified to be the best algorithm based on accuracy results. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - The real-time monitoring and tracking systems play a critical role in the healthcare field. Wearable medical devices with sensors, mobile applications, and health cloud have continuously generated an enormous amount of data, often called streaming big data. Due to the higher speed of the streaming data, it is difficult to ingest, process, and analyze such huge data in real-time to make real-time actions in case of emergencies. Using traditional methods that are inadequate and time-consuming. Therefore, there is a significant need for real-time big data stream processing to guarantee an effective and scalable solution. So, we proposed a new system for online prediction to predict health status using Spark streaming framework. The proposed system focuses on applying streaming machine learning models (i.e. streaming linear regression with SGD) on streaming health data events ingested to spark streaming through Kafka topics. The experimental results are done on the historical medical datasets (i.e. diabetes dataset, heart disease dataset, and breast cancer dataset) and generated dataset which is simulated to wearable medical sensors. The historical datasets have shown that the accuracy improvement ratio obtained using the diabetes disease dataset is the highest one with respect to the other two datasets with an accuracy of 81%. For generated datasets, the online prediction system has achieved accuracy with 98% at 5 seconds window size. Beyond this, the experimental results have proofed that the online prediction system can online learn and update the model according to the new data arrival and window size. © 2020, Science and Information Organization.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) security and privacy have received considerable research attention due to the IoT applicability in various domains. IoT systems have several applications, such as smart homes, smart cities, e-Health, industry, agriculture, and environmental monitoring. One of the most important applications is the Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT) because it helps humans and patients obtain rapid diagnoses, remote monitoring, and home rehabilitation. IoHT security can be classified into four categories: applications, architecture, communication, and data security. This paper presents a short, but focused, review on IoHT security and privacy. It also explores recent security algorithms and protocols that are used to secure personal patient data, clinicians, and healthcare information. The future vision of IoHT challenges and countermeasures is given at the end of this study.

AB  - Flexible wearable conductive hydrogel-based epidermal sensors have attracted tremendous attention due to their versatile potential applications in soft robotics, personal healthcare monitoring and electronic skins. However, it remains a critical challenge for hydrogel-based epidermal sensors to simultaneously achieve self-healing capability, self-adhesiveness and long-lasting moisture retention for full-scale human motion biomonitoring. Herein, a conductive, self-healing, adhesive and long-lastingly moist MXene nanocomposite organohydrogel is prepared from the conformal coating of the MXene nanosheet network by the polymer networks of dopamine grafted sodium alginate (Alg-DA), phenylboronic acid grafted sodium alginate (Alg-PBA) and polyacrylamide (PAAm) with a glycerol/water binary solvent as the dispersion medium. The obtained MXene nanocomposite organohydrogel exhibits excellent self-healing capability, superior self-adhesive performance and long-lasting moisture retention (10 days). Furthermore, the MXene nanocomposite organohydrogel can be assembled as a wearable epidermal sensor to detect human motion including large deformation (finger bending and wrist bending) and tiny deformation (swallowing, breathing, and pulse) with durable stability. Meanwhile, the assembled epidermal sensor could be employed to monitor human activities wirelessly via connecting a wireless transmitter. This work sheds new light on the development of flexible, self-healing, adhesive and long-lastingly moist epidermal sensors and electronic skins for personalized healthcare monitoring, human-machine interfaces, and artificial intelligence.

AB  - With the increasing emphasis on remote electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring, a variety of wearable remote ECG monitoring systems have been developed. However, most of these systems need improvement in terms of efficiency, stability, and accuracy. In this study, the performance of an ECG monitoring system is optimized by improving various aspects of the system. These aspects include the following: the judgment, marking, and annotation of ECG reports using artificial intelligence (AI) technology; the use of Internet of Things (IoT) to connect all the devices of the system and transmit data and information; and the use of a cloud platform for the uploading, storage, calculation, and analysis of patient data. The use of AI improves the accuracy and efficiency of ECG reports and solves the problem of the shortage and uneven distribution of high-quality medical resources. IoT technology ensures the good performance of remote ECG monitoring systems in terms of instantaneity and rapidity and, thus, guarantees the maximum utilization efficiency of high-quality medical resources. Through the optimization of remote ECG monitoring systems with AI and IoT technology, the operating efficiency, accuracy of signal detection, and system stability have been greatly improved, thereby establishing an excellent health monitoring and auxiliary diagnostic platform for medical workers and patients.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are often characterized by their multifactorial complexity. This makes remote monitoring and ambulatory cardiac rehabilitation (CR) therapy challenging. Current wearable multimodal devices enable remote monitoring. Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) can help in tackling multifaceted datasets. However, for clinical acceptance, easy interpretability of the AI models is crucial. The goal of the present study was to investigate whether a multi-parameter sensor could be used during a standardized activity test to interpret functional capacity in the longitudinal follow-up of CR patients. A total of 129 patients were followed for 3 months during CR using 6-min walking tests (6MWT) equipped with a wearable ECG and accelerometer device. Functional capacity was assessed based on 6MWT distance (6MWD). Linear and nonlinear interpretable models were explored to predict 6MWD. The t-distributed stochastic neighboring embedding (t-SNE) technique was exploited to embed and visualize high dimensional data. The performance of support vector machine (SVM) models, combining different features and using different kernel types, to predict functional capacity was evaluated. The SVM model, using chronotropic response and effort as input features, showed a mean absolute error of 42.8 m (±36.8 m). The 3D-maps derived using the t-SNE technique visualized the relationship between sensor-derived biomarkers and functional capacity, which enables tracking of the evolution of patients throughout the CR program. The current study showed that wearable monitoring combined with interpretable ML can objectively track clinical progression in a CR population. These results pave the road towards ambulatory CR. © MDPI AG. All rights reserved.

AB  - A higher proportion of patients with heart failure have benefitted from a wide and expanding variety of sensor-enabled implantable devices than any other patient group. These patients can now also take advantage of the ever-increasing availability and affordability of consumer electronics. Wearable, on and near-body sensor technologies, much like implantable devices, generate massive amounts of data. The connectivity of all these devices has created opportunities for pooling data from multiple sensors – so-called interconnectivity – and for artificial intelligence to provide new diagnostic, triage, risk-stratification and disease management insights for the delivery of better, more personalised and cost-effective healthcare. Artificial intelligence is also bringing important and previously inaccessible insights from our conventional cardiac investigations. The aim of this article is to review the convergence of artificial intelligence, sensor technologies and interconnectivity and the way in which this combination is set to change the care of patients with heart failure. © RADCLIFFE CARDIOLOGY 2020

AB  - The ongoing pandemic of Corona-Virus (COVID-19) induced by the coming forth category of SARS-CoV-2, has terrified the worldwide human health. Primarily, COVID-19 challenges can be categorized into (a) way of epidemic prevention and blocking transmission, (b) live monitoring of infected / suspected persons (c) FDA approved vaccine. Leading to said COVID-19 (a), (b) challenges, digit technologies such Artificial Intelligence, Big data analytics and Internet of Things (IoT), can play a vital role in epidemic prevention and blocking COVID-19 transmission. In this study, we have proposed a smart edge surveillance system that is effective in remote monitoring, advance warning and detection of a person's fever, heart beat rate, cardiac conditions and some of the radiological features to detect the infected (suspicious) person using wearable smart gadgets. The proposed framework provides a continually updated map/pattern of communication chain of COVID-19 infected persons that may span around in our national community. The health and societal impact of suggested research is to help public health authorities, researchers and clinicians contain and manage this disease through smart edge surveillance systems. The proposed model will help to detect and track the contagious person. Moreover, it will also keep the patient's data record for analysis and decision making using edge computing. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Purpose of Review: This review discusses how wearable devices—sensors externally applied to the body to measure a physiological signal—can be used in heart failure (HF) care. Recent Findings: Most wearables are marketed to consumers and can measure movement, heart rate, and blood pressure; detect and monitor arrhythmia; and support exercise training and rehabilitation. Wearable devices targeted at healthcare professionals include ECG patch recorders and vests, patches, and textiles with in-built sensors for improved prognostication and the early detection of acute decompensation. Integrating data from wearables into clinical decision-making has been slow due to clinical inertia and concerns regarding data security and validity, lack of evidence of meaningful impact, interoperability, regulatory and reimbursement issues, and legal liability. Summary: Although few studies have assessed how best to integrate wearable technologies into clinical practice, their use is rapidly expanding and may support improved decision-making by patients and healthcare professionals along the whole patient pathway. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Long-duration space missions require advanced medical capabilities, including continuous and automated monitoring of astronaut vital signs, to ensure optimal crew health. The potential latent health effects induced by reduced gravitational loading, high-energy cosmic rays, altered nutritional patterns and social stresses, call for an expanded framework of medical decision support system with real-time diagnostic telemonitoring independent of ground-based support systems. To monitor and diagnose cardiovascular health conditions, space agencies are utilizing wearable devices to collect continuous biosignal data. However, there is a lack of symptomatic wearable electrocardiogram (ECG)data from astronauts. This work focuses on the development of a deep learning framework, the ECG Generator of Representative Encoding of Style and Symptoms (EGRESS), which harnesses traditional machine learning to build a novel generative model for Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enhanced cardiac monitoring. EGRESS produces symptomatic data that resemble the output of a wearable device, which enables training of diagnostic tools for cardiac conditions. Our approach can reproduce ECG signals with 1.3X-3.6X reduction in mean squared error (MSE) compared to standard reconstruction-based approaches. This work is an important first step towards the development of an onboard AI doctor system. Copyright © 2020 by Frontier Development Lab (NASA-FDL).

AB  - The healthcare industry is in a state of great despair with rising healthcare costs, an aging global population, and an increase in new and chronic diseases. This could lead to a state of healthcare services being out of reach of ordinary people making them unproductive and prone to chronic diseases. The Internet of Things (IoT) has tremendously transformed and revolutionized the way present healthcare services are being provided to patients. The technology allows remote monitoring in the healthcare sector, helping in the continuous and safe monitoring of a patient’s health condition, and empowering physicians to deliver quality healthcare at reasonable costs. The level of patient/doctor interaction has increased tremendously leading to widespread satisfaction with improved healthcare efficiency among patients due to the ease of interaction with healthcare providers. It has also helped to reduce the duration and length of hospital stay for patients, having a major impact on reducing the healthcare costs and improving treatment outcomes. Several applications in the healthcare sector employing IoT are presently available to benefit healthcare providers, hospitals, insurance companies, and patients at large. IoT has largely benefited critically ill patients and the elderly population living alone who require continuous monitoring due to their diseased condition by tracking their health conditions on a regular basis and allowing any disturbances or changes in routine daily living activities to trigger an alarm to a family member or concerned healthcare providers for an immediate check on their condition and provide instant care and treatment to avoid any fatalities or long-term damage. However, several potential challenges exist while designing any IoT-based healthcare system such as security and privacy, user identification and authentication, and regular communication and exchange of healthcare data, which need to be addressed before the technology can be adopted on a wider scale. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The last decade has seen tremendous improvements in technologies for Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) management, in particular the so-called artificial pancreas (AP), a wearable closed-loop device modulating insulin injection based on glucose sensor readings. Unluckily, the AP actuator, an insulin pump, is subject to failures, with potentially serious consequences for subject safety. This calls for the development of advanced monitoring systems, leveraging the unprecedented data availability. This paper tackles for the first time the problem of automatically detecting pump faults with multidimensional data-driven anomaly detection (AD) methodologies. The approach allows to avoid the subtask of identifying a physiological model, typical of model-based approaches. Furthermore, we employ unsupervised methods, removing the need of labeled data for training, hardly available in practice. The adopted data-driven AD methods are local outlier factor, connectivity-based outlier factor, and isolation forest. Moreover, we propose a modification of these methods to cope with the dynamic nature of the underlying problem. The algorithms were tuned and tested on: 1) two-synthetic 100-patients' data set, of one-month data each, generated using the 'UVA/Padova T1D Simulator,' a large-scale nonlinear computer simulator of T1D subject physiology, largely adopted in AP research and accepted by the American Food and Drug Administration as a replacement of preclinical animal trials for AP and 2) a real 7-patients' data set consisting of one month in free-living conditions. The satisfactory accuracy of the proposed approach paves the way to the embedding of these methodologies in AP systems or their deployment in remote monitoring systems. © 1993-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Purpose of Review: Out-of-office blood pressure (BP) monitoring techniques, including home and ambulatory BP monitoring, are currently recommended by hypertension guidelines worldwide to confirm the diagnosis of hypertension and to monitor the appropriateness of treatment. However, such techniques are not always effectively implemented or timely available in the routine clinical practice. In recent years, the widespread availability of e-health solutions has stimulated the development of blood pressure telemonitoring (BPT) systems, which allow remote BP tracking and tighter and more efficient monitoring of patients’ health status. Recent Findings: There is currently strong evidence that BPT may be of benefit for hypertension screening and diagnosis and for improving hypertension management. The advantage is more significant when BPT is coupled with multimodal interventions involving a physician, a nurse or pharmacist, and including education on lifestyle and risk factors and drug management. Several randomized controlled studies documented enhanced hypertension management and improved BP control of hypertensive patients through BPT. Potential additional effects of BPT are represented by improved compliance to treatment, intensification, and optimization of drug use, improved quality of life, reduction in risk of developing cardiovascular complications, and cost-saving. Applications based on m-health and making use of wearables or smartwatches integrated with machine learning models are particularly promising for the future development of efficient BPT solutions, and they will provide remarkable support decision tools for doctors. Summary: BPT and telehealth will soon disrupt hypertension management. However, which approach will be the most effective and whether it will be sustainable in the long-term still need to be elucidated. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This is a proposal for an automated detection and remote monitoring system made up of a centralized network of communicating portable electronic devices based on biomedical sensors operating in the IoT context in synergy with wireless sensor network technologies, telemedicine and artificial intelligence. This network will be deployed to monitor a population settling in a target area (cities, region, country, etc.). The goal of this system is the detection and early diagnosis of the disease in people infected with the COVID-19 virus, using a device (such as a bracelet or a chest strap). This device collects in real time all the necessary biomedical measurements of a person, including their location, freeing them from any hospitalization or use of complex and expensive equipment. These informations are then transmitted, via a wireless connection, to a regional or national control center which takes care of its storage in a specialized database. This center executes a decision-making algorithm using artificial intelligence and fuzzy inference engine to detect accurately each possible abnormal change in the supervised biomedical signs reflecting risk factor or indicating the appearance of symptoms characterizing COVID-19 disease. In the positive case, the control system triggers a warning alarm concerning this infected person and requests intervention of the competent authorities to take the necessary measures and actions. Computer simulations with Matlab software tool have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed system. Study findings show that the designed device is suitable for application in COVID-19 patient monitoring.  © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - This article describes the design, development and implementation of a set of microservices based on an architecture that enables detection and assisted clinical diagnosis within the field of infectious diseases of elderly patients, via a telemonitoring system. The proposed system is designed to continuously update a medical database fed with vital signs from biosensor kits applied by nurses to elderly people on a daily basis. The database is hosted in the cloud and is managed by a flexible microservices software architecture. The computational paradigms of the edge and the cloud were used in the implementation of a hybrid cloud architecture in order to support versatile high-performance applications under the microservices pattern for the pre-diagnosis of infectious diseases in elderly patients. The results of an analysis of the usability of the equipment, the performance of the architecture and the service concept show that the proposed e-health system is feasible and innovative. The system components are also selected to give a cost-effective implementation for people living in disadvantaged areas. The proposed e-health system is also suitable for distributed computing, big data and NoSQL structures, thus allowing the immediate application of machine learning and AI algorithms to discover knowledge patterns from the overall population.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - In recent years, AI(Artificial Intelligence) has achieved great development in modern society. More and more modern technologies are applied in surveillance and monitoring. Healthcare monitoring is growing ubiquitous in modern wearable devices, such as a smart watch, electrocardiogram (ECG) necklace, smart band. Many sensors are attached to these smart devices to record and monitor physiological signals caused by activities, and then propagated those recorded electrical data to be further processed to give health diagnosis, disease prevention or making a distress call automatically. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a sleep disorder with a high occurrence in adult people and observed as an autonomous risk factor for circulatory problems such as ischemic heart attacks and stroke. Numerous traditional neural network based methods have been developed to detect OSA, where these methods however could not provide the intended result because they rely on shallow network. In this paper, we propose an effective OSA detection based on Convolutional neural network. Our method first extracts features from Apnea-Electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings using RR-intervals (time interval from one R-wave to the next R-wave in an ECG signal) and then CNN model having three convolution layers and three fully connected layers is trained with extracted features and applied for OSA detection. The first two convolution layers are followed by batch normalization and pooling layer, and softmax is connected to the last fully connected layer to give final decision. Experimental results on extracted feature of Apnea-ECG signal reveal that our model have better results in terms of performance measure sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. It is expected that the related technology can be applied into smart sensors, especially wearable devices. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using wearable and mobile sensors has gained momentum in last few years, in various fields, such as, healthcare, surveillance, education, entertainment. Nowadays, Edge Computing has emerged to reduce communication latency and network traffic. Edge devices are resource constrained devices and cannot support high computation. In literature, various models have been developed for HAR. In recent years, deep learning algorithms have shown high performance in HAR, but these algorithms require lot of computation making them inefficient to be deployed on edge devices. This paper, proposes a Lightweight Deep Learning Model for HAR requiring less computational power, making it suitable to be deployed on edge devices. The performance of proposed model is tested on the participant's six daily activities data. Results show that the proposed model outperforms many of the existing machine learning and deep learning techniques. © 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease affecting millions worldwide. Bespoke subject-specific treatment (medication or deep brain stimulation (DBS)) is critical for management, yet depends on precise assessment cardinal PD symptoms - bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor. Clinician diagnosis is the basis of treatment, yet it allows only a cross-sectional assessment of symptoms which can vary on an hourly basis and is liable to inter- and intra-rater subjectivity across human examiners. Automated symptomatic assessment has attracted significant interest to optimise treatment regimens between clinician visits, however, no wearable has the capacity to simultaneously assess all three cardinal symptoms. Challenges in the measurement of rigidity, mapping muscle activity out-of-clinic and sensor fusion have inhibited translation. In this study, we address all through a novel wearable sensor system and machine learning algorithms. The sensor system is composed of a force-sensor, three inertial measurement units (IMUs) and four custom mechanomyography (MMG) sensors. The system was tested in its capacity to predict Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores based on quantitative assessment of bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor in PD patients. 23 PD patients were tested with the sensor system in parallel with exams conducted by treating clinicians and 10 healthy subjects were recruited as a comparison control group. Results prove the system accurately predicts UPDRS scores for all symptoms (85.4% match on average with physician assessment) and discriminates between healthy subjects and PD patients (96.6% on average). MMG features can also be used for remote monitoring of severity and fluctuations in PD symptoms out-of-clinic. This closed-loop feedback system enables individually tailored and regularly updated treatment, facilitating better outcomes for a very large patient population. © 2001-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Background: Capacity to deliver outpatient care for patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) may soon be outweighed by need. This systematic review aims to investigate the comparative effectiveness, safety, and cost for virtual or remote clinic interventions for patients with CIEDs and explores how outcomes may be influenced by patient or system factors in-depth. Methods: We will perform a systematic literature search in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Proquest Dissertations & Theses, other EBM Reviews, and trial registry databases. Two authors will independently screen titles and abstracts for eligibility. We will include randomized and non-randomized controlled trials, quasi-randomized and experimental studies, cohort, and case-control studies. Study populations of interest are individuals with a CIED (pacemaker, ICD, CRT). Eligibility will be restricted to virtual or remote follow-up or care interventions compared to any other approach. The co-primary outcomes of interest are mortality and patient satisfaction. Secondary outcomes include clinical effectiveness (e.g., ICD shock, time-to-detection of medical event, hospitalizations), safety (e.g., serious or device-related adverse events), device efficacy (e.g., transmissions, malfunctions), costs, workflow (e.g., resources, process outcomes, time-saved), and patient reported (e.g., burden, quality of life). Data will be extracted by one author and checked by a second using a standardized template. We will use published frameworks to capture data relevant to intervention effects that may be influenced by intervention definition or complexity, context and setting, or in socially disadvantaged populations. Detailed descriptive results will be presented for all included studies and outcomes, and where feasible, synthesized using meta-analysis. Risk of bias will be assessed by two review authors independently using Cochrane Risk of Bias tools. Certainty of evidence will be assessed using the GRADE approach. Discussion: Increases in number of CIEDs implanted, combined with an aging population and finite health resource allocations at the system-level may lead to increased reliance on virtual follow-up or care models in the future. These models must prioritize consistent, equitable, and timely care as a priority. Results from this systematic review will provide important insight into the potential contextual factors which moderate or mediate the effectiveness, safety, and cost of virtual follow-up or care models for patients.

AB  - Electrocardiogram (ECG) has been the golden standard for the detection of cardiovascular disease for many years. Any electrical impulse disruption that causes the heart to the contract may lead to arrhythmia. Arrhythmia patients have no indications of having an arrhythmia, but a doctor may recognize arrhythmias in a routine test. Therefore, continuous wearable personal monitoring system plays a big role, and it's become popular day by day. This research focuses on designing and developing a method for predicting arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation) along with monitoring the ECG signals. To create an arrhythmia prediction model and an Android-based real-time ECG surveillance system, Long Short-Term Memories neural network, Recurrent Neural Network, TensorFlow and Keras library are applied here. Those deep learning models and algorithms help to achieve overall 97.57% accuracy on arrhythmia prediction. The system is being designed with Raspberry pi 3, Arduino UNO, AD8232 single lead ECG sensor, HC-05 Bluetooth, biomedical sensor pad and battery. This system will make easier for doctors to monitor the ECG of their patients outside the hospital and also help for remote ECG monitoring. The total components cost of this research work is around USD 58.  © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Background: Due to demographic change and, more recently, coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the importance of modern intensive care units (ICU) is becoming apparent. One of the key components of an ICU is the continuous monitoring of patients' vital parameters. However, existing advances in informatics, signal processing, or engineering that could alleviate the burden on ICUs have not yet been applied. This could be due to the lack of user involvement in research and development. Objective: This study focused on the satisfaction of ICU staff with current patient monitoring and their suggestions for future improvements. We aimed to identify aspects of monitoring that interrupt patient care, display devices for remote monitoring, use cases for artificial intelligence (AI), and whether ICU staff members are willing to improve their digital literacy or contribute to the improvement of patient monitoring. We further aimed to identify differences in the responses of different professional groups. Methods: This survey study was performed with ICU staff from 4 ICUs of a German university hospital between November 2019 and January 2020. We developed a web-based 36-item survey questionnaire, by analyzing a preceding qualitative interview study with ICU staff, about the clinical requirements of future patient monitoring. Statistical analyses of questionnaire results included median values with their bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals, and chi-square tests to compare the distributions of item responses of the professional groups. Results: In total, 86 of the 270 ICU physicians and nurses completed the survey questionnaire. The majority stated they felt confident using the patient monitoring equipment, but that high rates of false-positive alarms and the many sensor cables interrupted patient care. Regarding future improvements, respondents asked for wireless sensors, a reduction in the number of false-positive alarms, and hospital standard operating procedures for alarm management. Responses to the display devices proposed for remote patient monitoring were divided. Most respondents indicated it would be useful for earlier alerting or when they were responsible for multiple wards. AI for ICUs would be useful for early detection of complications and an increased risk of mortality; in addition, the AI could propose guidelines for therapy and diagnostics. Transparency, interoperability, usability, and staff training were essential to promote the use of AI. The majority wanted to learn more about new technologies for the ICU and required more time for learning. Physicians had fewer reservations than nurses about AI-based intelligent alarm management and using mobile phones for remote monitoring. Conclusions: This survey study of ICU staff revealed key improvements for patient monitoring in intensive care medicine. Hospital providers and medical device manufacturers should focus on reducing false alarms, implementing hospital alarm standard operating procedures, introducing wireless sensors, preparing for the use of AI, and enhancing the digital literacy of ICU staff. Our results may contribute to the user-centered transfer of digital technologies into practice to alleviate challenges in intensive care medicine. © 2020 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

AB  - Usually, plenty of energy forms can be found in our ambient environment including ubiquitous mechanical energies, such as rotation, vibration, and fluctuation energies and other energy forms, such as thermal, solar and chemical energies. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) that can convert various mechanical energies into electricity have experienced a rapid explosion since 2012 for their potential as a long-term power supply for sensing networks and wearable/portable electronics. To further increase the energy conversion efficiency or expand the application scenes of energy harvesters, hybrid energy harvesting technology based on the TENGs has been developed. In this article, we review the recent progress about the TENG-based hybrid energy cells, including hybrid devices for individually harvesting single energy through multi mechanisms, hybrid counterparts for converting multi-type energies at different situations, and hybridization systems. For single mechanical energy harvesting, the comparison of triboelectric and piezoelectric/electromagnetic generators and their different hybridization modes have been detailed discussed. For multi-type energy harvesting, different structure designs and application scenes are summarized. Finally, integrated hybridization systems are introduced to demonstrate the practicability of the TENG-based self-powered smart system. The summarized development trend and design guidelines will be beneficial to the research of energy harvesters and smart systems, including wearable/portable electronic systems, remote monitoring systems, artificial intelligence and the smart sensing networks, etc. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The spread of COVID-19, which has infected over 10 million people worldwide, entails the need for fast and aggressive testing never like before. As countries look to expanding testing, such test solutions must not only be technically sound, but should also be feasible and convenient for the user. The aim of this paper is to review the emerging tests and technology which can be potentially used to detect and assess the condition of those infected with the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the challenges in their development and use. The paper deals with 1) In vitro diagnostic tests(IVDs),i.e tests that use biological samples like blood and consist of 2 types: nucleic acid tests, which detect the RNA of the virus, and antibody tests which antibodies created by the body in response to the virus. 2) Chest X-Ray and CT scan devices, associated Deep Learning based detection methods and portable devices. 3) Wearable sensors, IoT and telemedicine for remote monitoring of COVID-19 patients to assess their condition, and also of Non-COVID-19 ones to reduce risks of cross-infection. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - The leading causes of death worldwide are chronic illnesses suchlike diabetes, Heart Disease (HD), cancer as well as chronic respiratory malady. It is remarkably intricate to diagnose HD with disparate symptoms or features. With the augmentation in popularity of smart wearable gadgets, a chance to render an Internet of Things (IoT) solution has turned out to be more. Unfortunately, the survival rates are low for the people suffering from sudden heart attacks. Consequently, a patient monitoring scheme intended for heart patients utilizing IoT centered Deep Learning Modified Neural Network (DLMNN) is proposed to assist in the HD diagnosis, and medication is given accordingly. This proposed technique is executed via '3' steps: I) Authentication, ii) Encryption, and iii) Classification. First, by utilizing the substitution cipher (SC) together with the SHA-512, the heart patient of the specific hospital is authenticated. Subsequently, the wearable IoT sensor device, which is fixed to the patient's body, concurrently transmits the sensor data to the cloud. This sensor data is encrypted and securely transmitted to the cloud utilizing the PDH-AES technique. After that, the encrypted data is finally decrypted, and by employing the DLMNN classifier, the classification is done. The classified outcomes comprise '2'types of data: i) normal and ii) abnormal. It denotes the patient's heart condition and if the outcome is abnormal, an alert text is passed to the physician for treating the patient. The investigational outcomes are estimated and the DLMNN for HD diagnosis shows improvement as compared to existing algorithms. Additionally, the proposed PDH-AES used in support of secure data transmission results in the highest level of security i.e. 95.87%, and it is achieved in the lowest time for encryption along with decryption when weighted against the existent AES. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - This article serves as the introduction to this special issue on Mobile Health and Mobile Rehabilitation for People with Disabilities. Social, technological and policy trends are reviewed. Needs, opportunities and challenges for the emerging fields of mobile health (mHealth, aka eHealth) and mobile rehabilitation (mRehab) are discussed. Healthcare in the United States (U.S.) is at a critical juncture characterized by: (1) a growing need for healthcare and rehabilitation services; (2) maturing technological capabilities to support more effective and efficient health services; (3) evolving public policies designed, by turns, to contain cost and support new models of care; and (4) a growing need to ensure acceptance and usability of new health technologies by people with disabilities and chronic conditions, clinicians and health delivery systems. Discussion of demographic and population health data, healthcare service delivery and a public policy primarily focuses on the U.S. However, trends identified (aging populations, growing prevalence of chronic conditions and disability, labor shortages in healthcare) apply to most countries with advanced economies and others. Furthermore, technologies that enable mRehab (wearable sensors, in-home environmental monitors, cloud computing, artificial intelligence) transcend national boundaries. Remote and mobile healthcare delivery is needed and inevitable. Proactive engagement is critical to ensure acceptance and effectiveness for all stakeholders. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The IoT has applications in many areas such as manufacturing, healthcare, and agriculture, to name a few. Recently, wearable devices have become popular with wide applications in the health monitoring system which has stimulated the growth of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). The IoMT has an important role to play in reducing the mortality rate by the early detection of disease. The prediction of heart disease is a key issue in the analysis of clinical dataset. The aim of the proposed investigation is to identify the key characteristics of heart disease prediction using machine learning techniques. Many studies have focused on heart disease diagnosis, but the accuracy of the findings is low. Therefore, to improve prediction accuracy, an IoMT framework for the diagnosis of heart disease using modified salp swarm optimization (MSSO) and an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is proposed. The proposed MSSO-ANFIS improves the search capability using the Levy flight algorithm. The regular learning process in ANFIS is dependent on gradient-based learning and has a tendency to become trapped in local minima. The learning parameters are optimized utilizing MSSO to provide better results for ANFIS. The following information is taken from medical records to predict the risk of heart disease: blood pressure (BP), age, sex, chest pain, cholesterol, blood sugar, etc. The heart condition is identified by classifying the received sensor data using MSSO-ANFIS. A simulation and analysis is conducted to show that MSSA-ANFIS works well in relation to disease prediction. The results of the simulation demonstrate that the MSSO-ANFIS prediction model achieves better accuracy than the other approaches. The proposed MSSO-ANFIS prediction model obtains an accuracy of 99.45 with a precision of 96.54, which is higher than the other approaches. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Telehealth and remote patient monitoring have expanded the reach of traditional clinical practice by removing geographical barriers as well as clinical limitations. Will this lead to increased value in healthcare? Are clinical outcomes going to improve alongside the delivery of better patient experiences? Will technology make the delivery of healthcare more sustainable? Despite most of us feeling like we could not work, live, or play without our mobile phones, they have only been in existence (as we know them today) for the last 20 years. However, the continuous advancement of technology and capability has affected healthcare and brought medicine, first into our homes and increasingly into our pockets. The future of telehealth fits into a consumer world that expects high quality, instant access, and personalized health propositions. As the demand for personalized medicine rises, more devices are released to capture vital signs, well-being metrics, and background data. In the clinical setting, this could allow real-time monitoring and preemptive doctor/patient interactions to prevent adverse incidents. At the very least, these developments offer the chance for richer and better-informed clinical decisions to be made based on longitudinal metrics. None of this is happening in isolation, and in fact some of the biggest companies in the world (e.g., Apple) have made their intent clear with devices such as watches which have engaged people to perform remote monitoring even when they are not “patients”. This combined with the increasing number of health apps (325, 000 in 2017) are changing the way people engage with their own health and interact with clinicians. It is expected that telehealth and wearable technology-allowing remote monitoring-will continue to play an increasingly significant role in almost all future healthcare delivery models from prevention to recovery and everything in-between. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Lifetime of medical equipment in hospitals ranges between 1 to 16 years, depending on the usage and maintenance of the medical device. Reusing the obsolete medical devices, converting them to low-cost educational systems and cutting down the charge of new educational medical equipment is the aim of this study. The proposed system is retrofitted with new mechanical and electrical modifications which include system identification and Proportional-Integral (PI) controller based on MATLAB, incremental rotary encoder, zero crossing phase controlling dimming circuit and Arduino microcontroller. System identification was applied to represent the new modified system by z-transform. Acting stresses, displacement, and factor of safety tests were applied through motion study. The proposed new mechanical part integrated with the original system yielded a maximum stress of 11.09 MN/m2 which below the value of the yield strength of the plain carbon steel SAE 1030 which is 220 MN/m2, The maximum displacement was 0.2 mm and the minimum factor of safety was 3.7 leading to the fact that the newly designed shaft can support not only 11.09 MN/m2 but also 41.033 MN/m2 when rotating at 1000 RPM. The proposed system was designed, implemented and tested as the whole system was modelled by 97.7% best-fit using z-transform. Also, a clinical validation has achieved by means of four different blood parameters: glucose, cholesterol, creatinine, and turbidity. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The clinical assessment technology such as remote monitoring of rehabilitation progress for lower limb related ailments rely on the automatic evaluation of movement performed along with an estimation of joint angle information. In this paper, we introduce a transfer-learning based Long-term Recurrent Convolution Network (LRCN) named as 'MyoNet' for the classification of lower limb movements, along with the prediction of the corresponding knee joint angle. The model consists of three blocks- (i) feature extractor block, (ii) joint angle prediction block, and (iii) movement classification block. Initially, the model is end-to-end trained for knee joint angle prediction followed by transferring the knowledge of a trained model to the movement classification through transfer-learning approach making a memory and computationally efficient design. The proposed MyoNet was evaluated on publicly available University of California (UC) Irvine machine learning repository dataset of the lower limb for 11 healthy subjects and 11 subjects with knee pathology for three movements type-walking, standing with knee flexion movements and sitting with knee extension movements. The average mean absolute error (MAE) resulted in the prediction of joint angle for healthy subjects and subjects with knee pathology are 8.1 % and 9.2 % respectively. Subsequently, an average classification accuracy of 98.1 % and 92.4 % were achieved for healthy subjects and subjects with knee pathology, respectively. Interestingly, the significance of this study in itself is promising with substantial improvement in the performance compared to state-of-the-art methodologies. The clinical significance of such surface electromyography signals (sEMG) based movement recognition and prediction of corresponding joint angle system could be beneficial for remote monitoring of rehabilitation progress by the physiotherapist using wearables. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The National Bureau of Statistics of China shows that the population over 65 years old in China exceeds 166 million accounting for 11.93% of the total population by the end of 2018. The importance and severity of taking care of the elderly are becoming increasingly prominent. High-quality and meticulous care for the daily life of the elderly needs helpful and advanced sciences and technologies. Smart geriatric nursing is a must. Basing on the professional knowledge of geriatric nursing, this paper proposes a framework of smart geriatric nursing which consists of three aspects of smart nursing: smart geriatric nursing in physical health using biosensor and advanced devices, smart geriatric nursing in mental health based on user profile, and smart geriatric nursing for daily life based on big data in health. The deployment of the proposed method relies on the technologies of the Internet of Things (IoT), user profile system, big data, and many other advanced information technologies. The framework of methods can provide a useful reference for the systematic technical scheme of smart geriatric nursing in an aging society. Copyright © 2020 Shijie Li and Yongchuan Tang.

AB  - Wearable sensor-based devices are increasingly applied in free-living and clinical settings to collect fine-grained, objective data about activity and sleep behavior. The manufacturers of these devices provide proprietary software that labels the sensor data at specified time intervals with activity and sleep information. If the device wearer has a health condition affecting their movement, such as a stroke, these labels and their values can vary greatly from manufacturer to manufacturer. Consequently, generating outcome predictions based on data collected from patients attending inpatient rehabilitation wearing different sensor devices can be challenging, which hampers usefulness of these data for patient care decisions. In this article, we present a data-driven approach to combining datasets collected from different device manufacturers. With the ability to combine datasets, we merge data from three different device manufacturers to form a larger dataset of time series data collected from 44 patients receiving inpatient therapy services. To gain insights into the recovery process, we use this dataset to build models that predict a patient's next day physical activity duration and next night sleep duration. Using our data-driven approach and the combined dataset, we obtained a normalized root mean square error prediction of 9.11% for daytime physical activity and 11.18% for nighttime sleep duration. Our sleep result is comparable to the accuracy we achieved using the manufacturer's sleep labels (12.26%). Our device-independent predictions are suitable for both point-of-care and remote monitoring applications to provide information to clinicians for customizing therapy services and potentially decreasing recovery time.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Objectives: Remote assessment of gait in patients' homes has become a valuable tool for monitoring the progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, these measurements are often not as accurate or reliable as clinical evaluations because it is challenging to objectively distinguish the unique gait characteristics of PD. We explore the inference of patients' stage of PD from their gait using machine learning analyses of data gathered from their smartphone sensors. Specifically, we investigate supervised machine learning (ML) models to classify the severity of the motor part of the UPDRS (MDS-UPDRS 2.10-2.13). Our goals are to facilitate remote monitoring of PD patients and to answer the following questions: (1) What is the patient PD stage based on their gait? (2) Which features are best for understanding and classifying PD gait severities? (3) Which ML classifier types best discriminate PD patients from healthy controls (HC)? and (4) Which ML classifier types can discriminate the severity of PD gait anomalies? Methodology: Our work uses smartphone sensor data gathered from 9520 patients in the mPower study, of whom 3101 participants uploaded gait recordings and 344 subjects and 471 controls uploaded at least 3 walking activities. We selected 152 PD patients who performed at least 3 recordings before and 3 recordings after taking medications and 304 HC who performed at least 3 walking recordings. From the accelerometer and gyroscope sensor data, we extracted statistical, time, wavelet and frequency domain features, and other lifestyle features were derived directly from participants' survey data. We conducted supervised classification experiments using 10-fold cross-validation and measured the model precision, accuracy, and area under the curve (AUC). Results: The best classification model, best feature, highest classification accuracy, and AUC were (1) random forest and entropy rate, 93% and 0.97, respectively, for walking balance (MDS-UPDRS-2.12); (2) bagged trees and MinMaxDiff, 95% and 0.92, respectively, for shaking/tremor (MDS-UPDRS-2.10); (3) bagged trees and entropy rate, 98% and 0.98, respectively, for freeze of gait; and (4) random forest and MinMaxDiff, 95% and 0.99, respectively, for distinguishing PD patients from HC. Conclusion: Machine learning classification was challenging due to the use of data that were subjectively labeled based on patients' answers to the MDS-UPDRS survey questions. However, with use of a significantly larger number of subjects than in prior work and clinically validated gait features, we were able to demonstrate that automatic patient classification based on smartphone sensor data can be used to objectively infer the severity of PD and the extent of specific gait anomalies. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - High-performance flexible pressure sensors with high sensitivity and large sensing range are vital components of the system for physiological signals collection, human-machine interaction and artificial intelligence. Herein, a flexible pressure sensor of copper nanowires/reduced graphene oxide/melamine foam (CuRGOMF) was fabricated by coating reduced graphene oxide (RGO) and in-situ growing of copper nanowires (Cu NWs) on the skeleton of melamine foam (MF). The as-prepared sensor features high sensitivity at wide working range (0.011 kPa−1, 0–1.5 kPa; 0.088 kPa−1, 1.5–10 kPa and 0.024kPa−1, 10–18 kPa) and cyclic stability (5000 cycles). The human motions of finger bending, grasping, clicking the mouse and picking up/dropping objects can be successfully detected in real-time based on the CuRGOMF sensor. The CuRGOMF sensor illustrates a promising candidate for healthcare monitoring and wearable device in artificial intelligence. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Implantable cardiac sensors have shown promise in reducing rehospitalization for heart failure (HF), but the efficacy of noninvasive approaches has not been determined. The objective of this study was to determine the accuracy of noninvasive remote monitoring in predicting HF rehospitalization. Methods: The LINK-HF study (Multisensor Non-invasive Remote Monitoring for Prediction of Heart Failure Exacerbation) examined the performance of a personalized analytical platform using continuous data streams to predict rehospitalization after HF admission. Study subjects were monitored for up to 3 months using a disposable multisensor patch placed on the chest that recorded physiological data. Data were uploaded continuously via smartphone to a cloud analytics platform. Machine learning was used to design a prognostic algorithm to detect HF exacerbation. Clinical events were formally adjudicated. Results: One hundred subjects aged 68.4±10.2 years (98% male) were enrolled. After discharge, the analytical platform derived a personalized baseline model of expected physiological values. Differences between baseline model estimated vital signs and actual monitored values were used to trigger a clinical alert. There were 35 unplanned nontrauma hospitalization events, including 24 worsening HF events. The platform was able to detect precursors of hospitalization for HF exacerbation with 76% to 88% sensitivity and 85% specificity. Median time between initial alert and readmission was 6.5 (4.2-13.7) days. Conclusions: Multivariate physiological telemetry from a wearable sensor can provide accurate early detection of impending rehospitalization with a predictive accuracy comparable to implanted devices. The clinical efficacy and generalizability of this low-cost noninvasive approach to rehospitalization mitigation should be further tested.  © 2020 American Heart Association, Inc.

AB  - In nearly 1 month, with a rapidly expanding corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), telemedicine has been transformed into an essential service for delivering routine clinical care. This transformation occurred as a crisis management response - driven by the need to provide care for patients with physical distancing measures in place. However, the current rapid adoption of telemedicine presents a transitional state between one that existed before the pandemic and one that could potentially be better aligned with the delivery of a personalized model of care. Using the conceptual framework of digital translucence - situating virtual encounters with more nuanced information regarding patients - we describe the role of integrated remote monitoring and virtual care tools aligned with the patient's electronic health record for adapting telemedicine delivery post-COVID-19.  © Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2020.

AB  - Parkinson's disease is a neuro-degenerative disorder characterized by the progressive death of dopamine neurons. This leads to delayed and uncoordinated movements, and impacts on the patients’ motor performance with reduced movement intensity, increased axial rigidity and impaired cadence regulation. Turning provides privileged insights in postural instability and fall prediction, as it is regularly performed during daily activities, requires multi-limb coordination. The objective of this work was to define a Quality of Movement (QoM) index, inferred from inertial data related to turns, and strictly correlated with the patient's motor conditions, postural stability, and stage of the disease. Such a concise representation finds its main application in the remote monitoring of patients during daily activities at home. We have recorded and analyzed 180° turns in 72 patients, using inertial sensors embedded in the smartphone. We have set up an algorithm for binary classification of patients: mild vs. moderate/severe conditions, according to the Hoehn and Yahr scale of disease progression and disability degree. Our QoM index is defined as the a posteriori probability output by this binary classifier. It exhibits high correlation (r = 0.73) with the clinical score of postural stability, as well as with the average of four clinical scores related to movement impairment (r = 0.75). These results, together with the widespread smartphone use, provide a step in the direction of a practical, objective and reliable tool for PD patients remote monitoring in domestic environment. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Internet of things (IoT) is one of the recent concepts that provide many services by exploiting the computational power of several devices. One of the emerging applications of the IoT-based technologies can be observed in the field of automated health care and diagnostics. With the help of IoT-based infrastructures, continuous data collection and monitoring are simpler. In most of the scenarios, collected data are massive, unstructured, and contain many redundant parts. It is always a challenging task to find an intelligent way to mine some useful information from a massive dataset with stipulated computing resources. Different types of sensors can be used to acquire data in real time. Some sensors can be body-worn sensors, and some sensors can be placed some distance apart from the body. In dermatological disease detection and classification problem, images of the infected region play a vital role. In this work, an optimized classification method is proposed that can be useful in performing automated classification job in the limited infrastructure of the IoT environment. The input features are optimized in such a way so that it can be useful in faster and accurate classification by the classifier that makes the system intelligent and optimized. Moreover, the hybrid classifier is optimized using different metaheuristic optimization methods for better convergence. The proposed work can be highly beneficial in exploring and applying the power of IoT in the healthcare industry. It is a small step toward the next-generation healthcare systems which can produce faster and accurate results at affordable cost with the help of IoT and remote healthcare monitoring. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.

AB  - Recently, wearable and flexible pressure sensors have sparked tremendous research interest, and considerable applications including human activity monitoring, biomedical research, and artificial intelligence interaction are reported. However, the large-scale preparation of low-cost, high-sensitivity piezoresistive sensors still face huge challenges. Inspired by the specific structures and excellent metal conductivity of a family of two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal carbides and nitrides (MXene) and the high-performance sensing effect of human skin including randomly distributed microstructural receptors, we fabricate a highly sensitive MXene-based piezoresistive sensor with bioinspired microspinous microstructures formed by a simple abrasive paper stencil printing process. The obtained piezoresistive sensor shows high sensitivity (151.4 kPa-1), relatively short response time (<130 ms), subtle pressure detection limit of 4.4 Pa, and excellent cycle stability over 10,000 cycles. The mechanism of the high sensitivity of the sensor is dynamically revealed from the structural perspective by means of in situ electron microscopy experiment and finite element simulation. Bioinspired microspinous microstructures can effectively improve the sensitivity of the pressure sensor and the limit of the detectable subtle pressure. In practice, the sensor shows great performance in monitoring human physiological signals, detecting quantitatively pressure distributions, and remote monitoring of intelligent robot motion in real time. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Internet of Medical Things (IoMTs) is fast emerging, thereby fostering rapid advances in the areas of sensing, actuation and connectivity to significantly improve the quality and accessibility of health care for everyone. Implantable medical device (IMD) is an example of such an IoMT-enabled device. IMDs treat the patient’s health and give a mechanism to provide regular remote monitoring to the healthcare providers. However, the current wireless communication channels can curb the security and privacy of these devices by allowing an attacker to interfere with both the data and communication. The privacy and security breaches in IMDs have thereby alarmed both the health providers and government agencies. Ensuring security of these small devices is a vital task to prevent severe health consequences to the bearer. The attacks can range from system to infrastructure levels where both the software and hardware of the IMD are compromised. In the recent years, biometric and cryptographic approaches to authentication, machine learning approaches to anomaly detection and external wearable devices for wireless communication protection have been proposed. However, the existing solutions for wireless medical devices are either heavy for memory constrained devices or require additional devices to be worn. To treat the present situation, there is a requirement to facilitate effective and secure data communication by introducing policies that will incentivize the development of security techniques. This paper proposes a novel electrocardiogram authentication scheme which uses Legendre approximation coupled with multi-layer perceptron model for providing three levels of security for data, network and application levels. The proposed model can reach up to 99.99% testing accuracy in identifying the authorized personnel even with 5 coefficients. © 2018, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.

AB  - Wearable sensors and social networking platforms play a key role in providing a new method to collect patient data for efficient healthcare monitoring. However, continuous patient monitoring using wearable sensors generates a large amount of healthcare data. In addition, the user-generated healthcare data on social networking sites come in large volumes and are unstructured. The existing healthcare monitoring systems are not efficient at extracting valuable information from sensors and social networking data, and they have difficulty analyzing it effectively. On top of that, the traditional machine learning approaches are not enough to process healthcare big data for abnormality prediction. Therefore, a novel healthcare monitoring framework based on the cloud environment and a big data analytics engine is proposed to precisely store and analyze healthcare data, and to improve the classification accuracy. The proposed big data analytics engine is based on data mining techniques, ontologies, and bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM). Data mining techniques efficiently preprocess the healthcare data and reduce the dimensionality of the data. The proposed ontologies provide semantic knowledge about entities and aspects, and their relations in the domains of diabetes and blood pressure (BP). Bi-LSTM correctly classifies the healthcare data to predict drug side effects and abnormal conditions in patients. Also, the proposed system classifies the patients’ health condition using their healthcare data related to diabetes, BP, mental health, and drug reviews. This framework is developed employing the Protégé Web Ontology Language tool with Java. The results show that the proposed model precisely handles heterogeneous data and improves the accuracy of health condition classification and drug side effect predictions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objective: Autonomic Dysreflexia (AD) is a potentially life-threatening syndrome which occurs in individuals with higher level spinal cord injuries (SCI). AD is caused by triggers which can lead to rapid escalation of pathophysiological responses and if the trigger is not removed, AD can be fatal. There is currently no objective, non-invasive and accurate monitoring system available to automatically detect the onset of AD symptoms in real time in a non-clinical setting. Technology or Method: We developed a user-independent method of symptomatic AD detection in real time with a wearable physiological telemetry system (PTS) and a machine learning model using data from eleven participants with SCI. Results: The PTS could detect onset of AD symptoms with an average accuracy of 94.10% and a false negative rate of 4.89%. Conclusions: The PTS can detect the onset of the symptoms AD with high sensitivity and specificity to assist people with SCIs in preventing the occurrence of AD. It would enable persons with high level SCIs to be more independent and pursue vocational activities while granting continuous medical oversight. Clinical Impact: The PTS could serve as a supplementary tool to current solutions to detect the onset of AD and prepare individuals who are newly injured to be better prepared for AD episodes. Moreover, it could be translated into a system to encourage individuals to practice better healthcare management to prevent future occurrences. © 2013 IEEE.
