N2  - Background: (R,R)-2,3-butanediol (BDO) is employed in a variety of applications and is gaining prominence due to its unique physicochemical features. The use of glycerol as a carbon source for 2,3-BDO production in Klebsiella pneumoniae has been limited, since 1,3-propanediol (PDO) is generated during glycerol fermentation. Results: In this study, the inactivation of the budC gene in K. pneumoniae increased the production rate of (R,R)-2,3-BDO from 21.92 ± 2.10 to 92.05 ± 1.20%. The major isomer form of K. pneumoniae (meso-2,3-BDO) was shifted to (R,R)-2,3-BDO. The purity of (R,R)-2,3-BDO was examined by agitation speed, and 98.54% of (R,R)-2,3-BDO was obtained at 500 rpm. However, as the cultivation period got longer, the purity of (R,R)-2,3-BDO declined. For this problem, a two-step agitation speed control strategy (adjusted from 500 to 400 rpm after 24 h) and over-expression of the dhaD gene involved in (R,R)-2,3-BDO biosynthesis were used. Nevertheless, the purity of (R,R)-2,3-BDO still gradually decreased over time. Finally, when pure glycerol was replaced with crude glycerol, the titer of 89.47 g/L of (R,R)-2,3-BDO (1.69 g/L of meso-2,3-BDO), productivity of 1.24 g/L/h, and yield of 0.35 g/g consumed crude glycerol was achieved while maintaining a purity of 98% or higher. Conclusions: This study is meaningful in that it demonstrated the highest production and productivity among studies in that produced (R,R)-2,3-BDO with a high purity in Klebsiella sp. strains. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to produce (R,R)-2,3-BDO using glycerol as the sole carbon source.

N2  - Background: Wearables hold potential to improve chronic disease self-management in conditions like cystic fibrosis (CF) through remote monitoring, early detection of illness and motivation. Little is known about the acceptability and sustainability of integrating wearables into routine care from the perspectives of people with CF (pwCF) and their treating clinicians. Methods: A cross-sectional qualitative study involving semi-structured interviews with adult pwCF and focus groups comprising members of a CF multidisciplinary team (MDT) were conducted at a specialist CF centre in Australia. A phenomenological orientation underpinned the study. Inductive thematic analysis was performed using the Framework method. The study adhered to the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) checklist. Results: Nine pwCF and eight members of a CF MDT, representing six clinical disciplines, participated in the study. Eight themes were inductively generated from the data, of which four were identified from each group. PwCF valued wearables for providing real-time data to motivate healthy behaviours and support shared goal-setting with healthcare providers. Wearables did not influence adherence to CF-specific self-management practices and had some hardware limitations. Members of the CF MDT recognised potential benefits of remote monitoring and shared goal-setting, but advised caution regarding data accuracy, generating patient anxiety in certain personality traits, and lack of evidence supporting use in CF self-management. Conclusions: Perspectives on integrating wearables into CF care were cautiously optimistic, with emerging risks related to patient anxiety and lack of evidence moderating acceptance.

N2  - Background: There is no FDA-approved left ventricular assist device (LVAD) for smaller children permitting routine hospital discharge. Smaller children supported with LVADs typically remain hospitalized for months awaiting heart transplant—a major burden for families and a challenge for hospitals. We describe the initial outcomes of the Jarvik 2015, a miniaturized implantable continuous flow LVAD, in the NHLBI-funded Pumps for Kids, Infants, and Neonates (PumpKIN) study, for bridge-to-heart transplant. Methods: Children weighing 8 to 30 kg with severe systolic heart failure and failing optimal medical therapy were recruited at 7 centers in the United States. Patients with severe right heart failure and single-ventricle congenital heart disease were excluded. The primary feasibility endpoint was survival to 30 days without severe stroke or non-operational device failure. Results: Of 7 children implanted, the median age was 2.2 (range 0.7, 7.1) years, median weight 10 (8.2 to 20.7) kilograms; 86% had dilated cardiomyopathy; 29% were INTERMACS profile 1. The median duration of Jarvik 2015 support was 149 (range 5 to 188) days where all 7 children survived including 5 to heart transplant, 1 to recovery, and 1 to conversion to a paracorporeal device. One patient experienced an ischemic stroke on day 53 of device support in the setting of myocardial recovery. One patient required ECMO support for intractable ventricular arrhythmias and was eventually transplanted from paracorporeal biventricular VAD support. The median pump speed was 1600 RPM with power ranging from 1–4 Watts. The median plasma free hemoglobin was 19, 30, 19 and 30 mg/dL at 7, 30, 90 and 180 days or time of explant, respectively. All patients reached the primary feasibility endpoint. Patient-reported outcomes with the device were favorable with respect to participation in a full range of activities. Due to financial issues with the manufacturer, the study was suspended after consent of the eighth patient. Conclusion: The Jarvik 2015 LVAD appears to hold important promise as an implantable continuous flow device for smaller children that may support hospital discharge. The FDA has approved the device to proceed to a 22-subject pivotal trial. Whether this device will survive to commercialization remains unclear because of the financial challenges faced by industry seeking to develop pediatric medical devices.

N2  - A high-yielding microbial polysaccharide-producing strain, named RM1603, was isolated from rhizosphere soil and identified by morphological and phylogenetic analysis. The extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) were identified by thin-layer chromatography and infrared spectroscopy. The fermentation conditions were optimized by single factor experiments in shake flasks and a 5-L fermentor. The results of morphological and phylogenetic tree analysis showed that RM1603 was a strain of Aureobasidium pullulans. Its microbial polysaccharide was identified as pullulan, and the EPS production capacity reached 33.07 ± 1.03 g L−1 in shake flasks. The fermentation conditions were optimized in a 5-L fermentor, and were found to encompass an initial pH of 6.5, aeration rate of 2 vvm, rotor speed of 600 rpm, and inoculum size of 2 %. Under these conditions, the pullulan yield of RM1603 reached 62.52 ± 0.24 g L−1. Thus, this study contributes RM1603 as a new isolation with high-yielding pullulan and potential application value in biotechnology.

N2  - The present study involved the isolation of two cadmium (Cd) and chromium (Cr) resistant strains, identified as Staphylococcus cohnii L1-N1 and Bacillus cereus CKN12, from heavy metal contaminated soils. S. cohnii L1-N1 exhibited a reduction of 24.4 % in Cr6+ and an adsorption rate of 6.43 % for Cd over a period of 5 days. These results were achieved under optimal conditions of pH (7.0), temperature (35 °C), shaking speed (200 rpm), and inoculum volume (8 %). B. cereus strain CKN12 exhibited complete reduction of Cr6+ within a span of 48 h, while it demonstrated a 57.3 % adsorption capacity for Cd over a period of 120 h. These results were achieved under conditions of optimal pH (8.0), temperature (40 °C), shaking speed (150 rpm), and inoculum volume (2–3 %). Additionally, microcharacterization and ICP-MS analysis revealed that Cr and Cd were accumulated on the cell surface, whereas Cr6+ was mainly reduced extracellularly. Subsequently, a series of pot experiments were conducted to provide evidence that the inclusion of S. cohnii L1-N1 or B. cereus CKN12 into the system resulted in a notable enhancement in both the plant height and biomass of king grass. In particular, it was observed that the presence of S. cohnii L1-N1 or B. cereus CKN12 in king grass led to a significant reduction in the levels of Cd and Cr in the soils (36.0 % and 27.8 %, or 72.9 % and 47.4 %, respectively). Thus, the results of this study indicate that the combined use of two bacterial strains can effectively aid in the remediation of tropical soils contaminated with moderate to light levels of Cd and Cr.

N2  - Flexible capacitive tactile sensors show great promise in personalized healthcare monitoring and human-machine interfaces, but their practical application is normally hindered because they rarely possess the required comprehensive performance, that is, high pressure sensitivity and fast response within a broad pressure range, high structure robustness, performance consistency, etc. This paper aims to engineer flexible capacitive pressure sensors with highly ordered porous dielectric microstructures and a 3D-printing-based fully solution-processable fabrication process. The proposed dielectric layer with uniformly distributed interior microporous can not only increase its compressibility and dynamic response within an extended pressure range but also enlarge its contact area with electrodes, contributing to a simultaneous improvement in the sensitivity, response speed, detection range, and structure robustness. Meanwhile, owing to its superior abilities in complex structure manufacturing and dimension controlling, the proposed 3D-printing-based fabrication process enables the consistent fabrication of the porous microstructure and thus guarantees device consistency. As a result, the prepared pressure sensors exhibit a high sensitivity of 0.21 kPa-1, fast response and relaxation times of 112 and 152 ms, an interface bonding strength of more than 455.2 kPa, and excellent performance consistency (≤5.47% deviation among different batches of sensors) and tunability. Encouraged by this, the pressure sensor is further integrated with a wireless readout circuit and realizes wireless wearable monitoring of various biosignals (pulse waves and heart rate) and body movements (from slight finger touch to large knee bending). Finally, the influence law of the feature parameters of the porous microstructure on device performance is established by the finite element method, paving the way for sensor optimization. This study motivates the development of flexible capacitive pressure sensors toward practical application.

N2  - Recent innovations in digital technology have enabled the simultaneous accumulation, and the linking and analysis of time-series big data relating to several factors that influence blood pressure (BP), including biological indicators, physical activity, and environmental information. Various approaches can be used to monitor BP: in the office/clinic; at home; 24-h ambulatory recording; or with wearable and cuffless devices. Of these, home BP monitoring is a reliable and convenient method, and is recommended for hypertension management by current national and international guidelines. This recommendation is based on evidence showing that home BP is an important predictor of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and kidney disease in patients with hypertension. In addition, lifetime personalized health record (PHR)-based home BP with telemonitoring combined with co-interventions has been shown to lower BP more effectively than the traditional approach based on office BP. Thus, home BP represents a key metric for personalized anticipation medicine, from digital healthcare to digital medicine. This paper summarizes the latest evidence on home BP monitoring and proposes a Hypertension Cardiovascular Outcome Prevention and Evidence in Asia (HOPE Asia) Network consensus on a home BP-centered approach to the management of hypertension.

N2  - Objectives: Digital Health Technologies (DHT) have the capacity to personalise healthcare, improve access to services and enhance patient outcomes. This can, in turn, reduce the burden on healthcare resources. The timely integration of DHTs into health systems relies on Accelerated Coverage Pathways for Innovation (ACPIs) which facilitate early access to these innovative solutions. This research aims to compare the various ACPIs for DHT coverage in Germany, France, and the United Kingdom. Methods: All publicly available documents on regulations, guidelines, and evaluation processes of the ACPIs in the three countries up to 2023 were identified and used to map available details of the programs. A theoretical evaluation using publicly available ACPI criteria was conducted to compare the likelihood of coverage of two technologies, used as case studies. This was done to comprehend the factors that may influence the adoption of DHT in respective countries. Results: The most appropriate DHT ACPIs were identified; one per country in scope: the AI in Health and Care award in the UK, DiGA in Germany, and PECAN Coverage in France. The pathways were compared to detect similarities and differences in coverage criteria. The theoretical evaluation resulted in 100% of the devices being eligible in the UK, 50% in Germany and 50% in France. (Theoretical evaluations were based on public information but actual authority evaluations could differ.) Conclusions: Innovative pathways for DHT adoption in the three countries all aim to expedite the delivery of life-saving, revolutionary technology. Our study showed that Germany has a smaller acceptance of the type of technologies they cover (risk class I & IIa) and strict evidence and technical requirements. Though France has a wider acceptance (Risk class I-III & remote patient monitoring devices), it only covers CE-marked digital devices. UK’s ACPI aims to support various devices through different lifecycle stages and differing levels of evidence generation.

N2  - Introduction: One of the major obstacles for early inpatient discharge after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (aSCT) is, aside from frailty and bloodwork required, the high risk for infections and the need for monitoring of graft versus host disease (GvHD). This requires frequent hospital visits which are often a challenge especially when travelling to hospitals imposes significant costs for the patient. Furthermore, structured data acquisition in the home care setting is missing. Methods: We have developed a fully patient centered, easy to operate mobile phone application for aHSCT patients that allows for treatment specific symptom reporting. In combination with a wearable device (smart watch), a blood pressure monitor and a thermometer, this application incorporates online monitoring of all major vital signs in almost real time. The application currently captures more than 50 static and dynamic metrics relevant for aSCT and provides a photo function to capture skin images in a patient specific image library. Daily symptom reporting can be performed as often as necessary and data from wearable devices are obtained in very high frequency. Symptom reporting includes information on general wellbeing, nausea, oral mucositis, bowel movement frequency and consistency, information on oral calorie and fluid uptake, and it captures and calculates body surface areas affected by rash. All data are streamed in almost real time and displayed on a browser-based dashboard to the healthcare team. The user interface for the physician dashboard was developed using the React JavaScript library whereas the mobile application utilized React Native to enable Android and iOS applications. The collection, storage, and presentation of patient data via the physician dashboard is facilitated using various AWS technologies such as Lambda, S3 and Timestream. Data can be stored according to federal laws and regulations the software is operating in. Access to the dashboard is center-specific and secured by a dual verification process. Summary: Daily symptom reporting by the patient is easy, comprehensive and can be completed within minutes. Data from wearable devices are obtained 24/7 at high frequency. All data are displayed on a dashboard to the corresponding physician with only a few minutes delay. The system captures vital signs (blood pressure, temperature, pulse, breathing rate, oxygen saturation, etc.) and GvHD related symptoms such as skin rash including body surface area affected, and frequency/volume of bowel movements. It provides information based on the patient's physical activity, food intake, fluid intake, sleeping patterns in a structured fashion. The physician's dashboard displays all transplant relevant static information like HLA match, conditioning regimen, type of immunosuppression, ABO incompatibility, serologies of patient and donor. It displays all data reported longitudinally and allows physicians to observe trends and developments providing interactive graphs on each metrics. It provides a medication plan that captures daily dosage, duration of treatment and calculates cumulative doses. Changes in medication and dosing will alert the patient on the mobile phone application. All data can be obtained in a structured fashion for research purposes by the participating institution. Conclusion: This mobile phone application in combination with a wearable device allows for remote monitoring of patients after aHSCT. Its function is comprehensive and not only provides structured data, but allows for monitoring success of medical treatment. It is developed in a modular fashion that can be easily adapted to specific requirements in other cell therapies such CAR CD19, AML induction therapies or autologous SCT.

N2  - Background: Despite high blood pressure being the leading preventable risk factor for death, only 1 in 3 patients achieve target blood pressure control. Key contributors to this problem are clinical inertia and uncertainties in relying on clinic blood pressure measurements to make treatment decisions. Methods: The NEXTGEN-BP open-label, multicenter, randomized controlled trial will investigate the efficacy, safety, acceptability and cost-effectiveness of a wearable blood pressure monitor-based care strategy for the treatment of hypertension, compared to usual care, in lowering clinic blood pressure over 12 months. NEXTGEN-BP will enroll 600 adults with high blood pressure, treated with 0 to 2 antihypertensive medications. Participants attending primary care practices in Australia will be randomized 1:1 to the intervention of a wearable-based remote care strategy or to usual care. Participants in the intervention arm will undergo continuous blood pressure monitoring using a wrist-wearable cuffless device (Aktiia, Switzerland) and participate in 2 telehealth consultations with their primary care practitioner (general practitioner [GP]) at months 1 and 2. Antihypertensive medication will be up-titrated by the primary care practitioner at the time of telehealth consults should the percentage of daytime blood pressure at target over the past week be <90%, if clinically tolerated. Participants in the usual care arm will have primary care consultations according to usual practice. The primary outcome is the difference between intervention and control in change in clinic systolic blood pressure from baseline to 12 months. Secondary outcomes will be assessed at month 3 and month 12, and include acceptability to patients and practitioners, cost-effectiveness, safety, medication adherence and patient engagement. Conclusions: NEXTGEN-BP will provide evidence for the effectiveness and safety of a new paradigm of wearable cuffless monitoring in the management of high blood pressure in primary care. Trial Registration: ACTRN12622001583730.

N2  - Conductive hydrogels, exhibiting wide applications in electronic skins and soft wearable sensors, often require maturely regulating of the hydrogel mechanical properties to meet specific demands and work for a long-term or under extreme environment. However, in situ regulation of the mechanical properties of hydrogels is still a challenge, and regular conductive hydrogels will inevitably freeze at subzero temperature and easily dehydrate, which leads to a short service life. Herein, a novel adhesive hydrogel (PAA-Dopa-Zr4+) capable of strain sensing is proposed with antifreezing, nondrying, strong surface adhesion, and tunable mechanical properties. 3,4-Dihydroxyphenyl-l-alanine (l-Dopa)-grafted poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and Zr4+ ion are introduced into the hydrogel, which broadly alters the mechanical properties via tuning the in situ aggregation state of polymer chains by ions based on the complexation effect. The catechol groups of l-Dopa and viscous glucose endow the hydrogel with high adhesiveness for skin and device interface (including humid and dry environments) and exhibit an outstanding temperature tolerance under extreme wide temperature spectrum (-35 to 65 °C) or long-lasting moisture retention (60 days). Furthermore, this PAA-Dopa-Zr4+ can be assembled as a flexible strain-sensitive sensor to detect human motions based on specific mechanical properties requirements. This work, enabling superior adhesive and temperature tolerance performance and broad mechanical tenability, presents a new paradigm for numerous applications to wearable sensing and personalized healthcare monitoring.

N2  - Four zebra finches in a closed research colony presented with variable clinical signs, including masses, skin lesions, shivering, and/or ruffled feathers. These birds were not responsive to treatment efforts; 3 died and one was euthanized. All 4 were submitted for necropsy to determine the cause of the clinical signs. Gross necropsy and histopathologic findings from all birds resulted in a diagnosis of round cell neoplasia in multiple organs, including the skin, liver, kidney, and reproductive tract, with intranuclear inclusion bodies in the neoplastic cells. In all 4 cases, immunohistochemical staining showed strong immunoreactivity for CD3 in 70% to 80% of the neoplastic round cells, with a relatively small subset that were immunopositive for Pax5. These findings supported a diagnosis of T-cell lymphoma. Frozen liver tissue from one case was submitted for next-generation sequencing (NGS), which revealed viral RNA with 100% sequence homology to canary polyomavirus strain 34639 that had originally been identified in a European goldfinch. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded scrolls from another case were also submitted for NGS, which revealed viral RNA with 97.2% sequence homology to canary polyomavirus strain 37273 that had originally been identified in a canary. To localize the virus in situ, RNAscope hybridization was performed using a probe designed to target the VP1 gene of the sequenced virus in frozen liver tissue. In all 4 cases, disseminated and robust hybridization signals were detected in neoplastic cells. These findings indicate that polyomaviruses have the potential to be oncogenic in zebra finches.

N2  - Background: Damaged hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis may result in adrenal insufficiency (AI) and require hydrocortisone replacement. Currently, there are no biometric or circulating biomarkers to assess hydrocortisone replacement adequacy. Dosing is based on symptomatology, often resulting in over- or undertreatment. Methods: We used remote monitoring precision health solutions to identify AI molecular and biometric biomarkers over 2 weeks. Using remote sampling devices (Mitra Neoteryx), 10-μL dried blood samples were collected weekly for protein analysis by AI subjects before and 5 hours after daily hydrocortisone doses and age- and sex matched adrenal sufficient (AS) subjects at approximately the same times. Continuous physical activity were measured with a wearable biosensor (Fitbit Charge HR) along with remote systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure and heart rate (HR) (Omron Evolv). Self-reported AddiQoL questionnaires were completed twice daily. For biometric endpoints and questionnaires, data are summarized as mean ± SD using two-sided t-tests, where a p value<0.05 is considered statistically significant. For proteomic analysis, median value was calculated, and statistical testing identified differentially expressed proteins (DEPs; FDR<5%). Results:Fifteen AI (6 primary AI [PAI] and 9 secondary AI [SAI] and 15 AS subjects completed the study. AI group mean age was 46.3±15.7 and AS was 41.7±13.2. In both groups, 80% were female. Adherence to home monitoring was 100% in AI subjects and >90% in AS (13/15 assessable for biometrics (activity and BP) and 14/15 for AddiQoL). SBP was lower in PAI (106.2±7.9/68.3±7.6 [n=5]) vs SAI (119.1±15.3/71.1±8.9 [n=8]; p=0.04). Nighttime BP (22:00-05:00) for both PAI (102.3±7.8/68.5 ±7.9) and SAI (101.2±8.2/63.8±9) were significantly lower than AS (115.5±15.6; p=0.04 and p=0.02, respectively). AI heart rate was lower vs AS at night (61.4±11.6 [n=13] vs 72.5±11.1 [n=11]; p=0.01), especially in PAI (57.7±5 [n=5]; p=0.001). Average daily activity was higher in AS than AI as measured by steps (9010 vs 7787; p=0.02), miles (3.94 vs 3.36; p=0.03) and stair flights (14.19 vs 9.85; p=0.01). On AddiQoL, AI subjects scored lower than AS subjects (126.8 ±18.1 vs 143.3±14.9, respectively; p<0.0001). Across all dried blood samples, 444 proteins were quantified. Comparing AI vs AS, 78 were identified before morning hydrocortisone dose vs 88 before afternoon dose. Forty-nine DEPs were commonly identified and showed the same regulation trends. Nine DEPs before and 18 DEPs after morning and afternoon dosing, respectively, were identified in AI. None of these DEPs were common, indicating potential blood proteome signature changes in the morning and in the afternoon. Conclusion: Remote monitoring of biometrics and blood proteome in AI is feasible and informative and may identify biomarkers to optimize hydrocortisone replacement therapy.

N2  - Recently, one of the primary concerns in e-textile-based healthcare monitoring systems for chronic illness patients has been reducing wasted power consumption, as the system should be always-on to capture diverse biochemical and physiological characteristics. However, the general conductive fibers, a major component of the existing wearable monitoring systems, have a positive gauge-factor (GF) that increases electrical resistance when stretched, so that the systems have no choice but to consume power continuously. Herein, a twisted conductive-fiber-based negatively responsive switch-type (NRS) strain-sensor with an extremely high negative GF (resistance change ratio ≈ 3.9 × 108 ) that can significantly increase its conductivity from insulating to conducting properties is developed. To this end, a precision cracking technology is devised, which could induce a difference in the Young's modulus of the encapsulated layer on the fiber through selective ultraviolet-irradiation treatment. Owing to this technology, the NRS strain-sensors can allow for effective regulation of the mutual contact resistance under tensile strain while maintaining superior durability for over 5000 stretching cycles. For further practical demonstrations, three healthcare monitoring systems (E-fitness pants, smart-masks, and posture correction T-shirts) with near-zero standby power are also developed, which opens up advancements in electronic textiles by expanding the utilization range of fiber strain-sensors.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Previously, Escherichia coli NSK015 was developed for high yield of 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PDO) production. To further improve 1,3-PDO concentration, parameters including kLa values with different agitations and impeller numbers, concentrations of coenzyme B12 and feeding strategies during fed-batch fermentation were investigated. RESULTS: In this study, aerobic conditions at 300 rpm agitation and 1 vvm aeration with two Rushton turbine impellers (kLa = 33.6 h−1) and the concentration of coenzyme B12 at 7.5 μmol L−1 were identified as the best optimized conditions to improve 1,3-PDO production by the strain. With a two-pulsed continuous feeding, E. coli NSK015 produced 1,3-PDO up to 60.3 g L−1 with the 1,3-PDO yield approaching a theoretical maximum of 0.97 g g−1 and productivity of 0.42 g L−1 h−1 in fed-batch fermentation, in which concentration was improved about 60% compared to that of batch fermentation. CONCLUSION: The result indicated the efficiency of E. coli NSK015 in producing 1,3-PDO under optimal aerobic conditions. The strain could even enhance growth and maintain enzymatic activities involved in the 1,3-PDO pathway without utilizing antibiotics, isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) or enriching nutrients. Plasmid instability, high production cost related to medium preparation and purification, and waste disposal were not of concern. This may provide a new insight for large-scale 1,3-PDO production by E. coli NSK015. Additionally, E. coli NSK015 could be a microbial host model for further developing new 1,3-PDO-producing microorganisms regardless of plasmid, inducer, antibiotics and rich nutrients in fermentation medium. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry (SCI).

N2  - Objectives: The role of startups has been growing in healthcare delivery, particularly in telehealth and telemedicine. Yet, little has been published about their role in evolving digital healthcare ecosystem. This study aimed to review the literature on telehealth startups to understand their roles, challenges, business models, and directions for sustainable innovation and commercialization. Methods: Ten databases were screened: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, ACM digital library, EBSCOhost, Embase, Medline, Cochrane review, and PsycINFO. The articles were shortlisted based on pre-determined screening criteria, and qualitative synthesis was performed. The quality of included studies was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Cohen's K was calculated to ensure the reliability of the authors scoring on the quality appraisal test and qualitative synthesis. Results: 26 articles were included in the review. Findings are clubbed under five themes: remote and on-demand healthcare; healthcare data management; digital therapeutics; high-tech driven personalized care; and information integration and exchange. Technical infrastructure, regulation, and revenue generation were identified as major challenges for telehealth start-ups. Osterwalder business canvas was the predominantly used model. Value perspectives were recognized for a sustainable telehealth innovation and its commercialization. Conclusion: Telehealth startups are evolving to meet digital healthcare needs and playing a significant role in teleconsultations, telemonitoring, and electronic health record solutions. Recently, their focus has shifted towards smartphone-enabled AI-driven personalized care, including digital therapeutics and wearable device innovation. They have significant technical and operational challenges in innovation and commercialization to optimize their role. The review also provides researchers with a new understanding of telehealth startups’ sustainable innovation and commercialization through the systematic direction of value proposition, creation, and capture.

N2  - Schizo-saccharomyces pombe (S.pombe) has been playing a pivotal role in biotech industries as a source of glucans; a biological response modifiers (BRM) and also been studied as a model strain for recombinant proteins in molecular biology. Owing to the presence of > 60% glucans in their cell wall structure, the present research was designed to understand the effect of nutrient regulation on growth of S.pombe (Italic form to economize the glucan production. The study was performed using two different media; yeast extract with supplements (YES) and yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) and the YPD medium was noticed to be the best and cost-effective for maximum growth of S.pombe Thereafter, a sequential optimization studies, starting with one factor at a time (OFAT) methodology followed by two step statistical approach Placket-burmann design (PBD) and Response surface methodology (RSM) improved the biomass yield from 14-34.5 g/L (1.5-fold) at shake flask level. Mass transfer of media components, temperature, dextrose and yeast extract have played significant role in metabolism mediated growth of the S.pombe. The major finding of the present study is non-significance of peptone in enhancing the S.pombe biomass. Validation of the above at bioreactor level with dextrose at 4%, rpm at 200, temperature at 28oC and yeast extract at 2% increased the biomass yield from 34.5 - 52 g/L.

N2  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is recently seeing significant advances in teledermatology (TD), also thanks to the developments that have taken place during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the last two years, there was an important development of studies that focused on opportunities, perspectives, and problems in this field. The topic is very important because the telemedicine and AI applied to dermatology have the opportunity to improve both the quality of healthcare for citizens and the workflow of healthcare professionals. This study conducted an overview on the opportunities, the perspectives, and the problems related to the integration of TD with AI. The methodology of this review, following a standardized checklist, was based on: (I) a search of PubMed and Scopus and (II) an eligibility assessment, using parameters with five levels of score. The outcome highlighted that applications of this integration have been identified in various skin pathologies and in quality control, both in eHealth and mHealth. Many of these applications are based on Apps used by citizens in mHealth for self-care with new opportunities but also open questions. A generalized enthusiasm has been registered regarding the opportunities and general perspectives on improving the quality of care, optimizing the healthcare processes, minimizing costs, reducing the stress in the healthcare facilities, and in making citizens, now at the center, more satisfied. However, critical issues have emerged related to: (a) the need to improve the process of diffusion of the Apps in the hands of citizens, with better design, validation, standardization, and cybersecurity; (b) the need for better attention paid to medico-legal and ethical issues; and (c) the need for the stabilization of international and national regulations. Targeted agreement initiatives, such as position statements, guidelines, and/or consensus initiatives, are needed to ensure a better result for all, along with the design of both specific plans and shared workflows.

N2  - The development of mobile telephones has made it possible to design blood pressure (BP) monitors with data transmission via cellular lines, contributing to the emergence of “e-health”. Today, the direct-to-consumer marketing of devices create a new context allowing an algorithmic processing of information for remote decision-making either by the patient or by a healthcare professional. The home BP telemonitoring (HBPT) is the remote transmission of BP values, measured at home and transmitted to the doctor’s office or hospital, by means of telehealth strategies. In this context, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) studies have demonstrated HBPT ability in improving patients’ compliance and adherence to treatment and in accomplishing better hypertension control rates. The level of evidence for the drop in BP is “moderate” and the place of HBPT is not clearly established in current practice. Digital interventions have the potential to support patient in self-management. This approach presupposes the prior acquisition of skills, the level of which must be adapted to the level of health literacy of each patient. Few of medical applications (mobile apps or web-apps) for hypertension can be regarded as accurate and safe for clinical use and to date, we do not have high quality evidence to determine the overall effect of the use smartphone apps on BP control.

N2  - D-amino acids, the important components of the bacterial cell walls, are valuable molecular and genetic markers of bacterial-derived organic material in the environment. D-serine, a racemization product of L-serine is one such amino acid present in various prokaryotes and eukaryotes. It is a well-recognized regulator of various activities in the human nervous system. In plants, it has a role in the nitrogen cycle regulation and pollen tube growth. Serine enantiomers are present in different concentrations and few bacterial strains are reported to contribute to D-serine in the environment. During the present study, soil samples from different places in North India were collected and processed to isolate and screen the bacteria on M9 minimal media (Himedia) for D-serine synthesis. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC Silica gel 60 F 254 (20 × 20 cm, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and Mass spectroscopic analysis (Bruker MICROTOF II spectrometer) studies, etc were performed. D-serine-producing isolates were characterized as per standard procedures. Bacterial isolate A1C1 with maximum D-serine (0.919 ± 0.02 nM) synthesis under optimal growth conditions (37°C ± 0.5, 150 ± 0.5 RPM, and 7 ± 0.5 pH) was identified as Bacillus tequilensis based on 16sRNA sequencing. The isolate could be a valuable serine racemization tool for various industrial and environmental applications.

N2  - Digital Therapeutics remain in a legal grey area as a clear and unique definition is not pro-vided by the European Union nor by EU Member State legislation. Although they are often considered as, or similar to, medical devices, this approach may be inadequate and misleading as it tends to mistake the device with the therapy that it delivers. The evolving and ex-panding sector of digital therapies mandates the adoption of new rules, hopefully at Euro-pean Union level, to properly address the challenges of digital health technologies both from the legal and the regulatory perspective.

N2  - In modern healthcare systems, medical devices are playing a major role which involves personalized medical devices which improve the patient's lifestyle as they can be remotely monitored and their data are transmissible. Due to these data transmissions, the number of connections to the existing computer networks is increased. Being interoperable and interconnected these personalized medical devices provide great benefits like improved sensing capabilities and actuating capabilities. But the problem with high connectivity computer networks is that it exposes medical device to high cybersecurity vulnerabilities. The main targets are the pacemakers and institutions like hospitals and clinics. Hackers can easily hack medical devices and change prescriptions. So a cybersecurity breach can leak a patient's sensitive and confidential data and risk the patient's life. To prevent these multifaceted problems from happening these problems must be viewed from a systematic perspective and requires governance, technical controls, regulation, and standards.

N2  - Evidence that hypertension is the most importat global risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and demonstration of the cardiovascular protection offered by antihypertensive treatment, have been based on upper-arm cuff blood pressure (BP) measurements. This approach is recommended by current hypertension guidelines for BP measurement in clinical practice, as well as for validation of novel BP measuring devices. However, the spot or intermittent BP measurements in static conditions allowed by arm-cuff devices are unable to identify and track the continuous and rapid BP changes characterizing daily life. Moreover, cuff-based BP measurements are exposed to errors related to cuff size, shape and positioning, and cuff inflation may itself induce an alerting response and produce discomfort in the users during daily activities and in particular during sleep, which may modify the measured BP levels. To face these issues, use of continuous recordings techniques, not based on arm-cuff inflation, would be required. This is possible through intra-arterial recordings, which however are not feasible in daily practice because of their invasiveness. An alternative solution is represented by photoplethysmographic volume-clamp method for finger BP monitoring which, however, is difficult to implement in clinical practice because of its cost and complexity. Technological progress is now offering an increasingly large and heterogeneous series of cuffless BP monitors, which estimate BP based on sensors, signal processing and algorithms embedded in wearable devices, smartphones or pocket devices. These cuffless devices might allow for comfortable and continuous BP recordings, detecting rapid BP changes during day and night sleep, thus offering information on both short, mid and long term BP variability. Cuffless devices might also be useful for continuous non invasive BP monitoring in different clinical settings, including ICUs, during anaesthesia, in patients with arrhythmias, hypotension/syncope, and other transient conditions affecting BP levels and variability. Moreover, cuffless BP measurement devices connected to telemonitoring facilities or smartphones apps may improve patients empowerment, adherence to treatment and long-term BP control. In spite of all these potential advantages, however, cuffless BP devices have to face specific accuracy issues, which would need refinement of specific validation protocols aimed at testing the need of individual calibration, the stability of measurements after calibration and the device actual ability to track BP changes before they might be recommended for clinical use.

N2  - Assessment of expertise development during training program primarily consists of evaluating interactions between task characteristics, performance, and mental load. Such a traditional assessment framework may lack consideration of individual characteristics when evaluating training on complex tasks, such as driving and piloting, where operators are typically required to execute multiple tasks simultaneously. Studies have already identified individual characteristics arising from intrinsic, context, strategy, personality, and preference as common predictors of performance and mental load. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effect of individual difference in skill acquisition and transfer using an ecologically valid dual task, behavioral, and brain activity measures. Specifically, we implemented a search and surveillance task (scanning and identifying targets) using a high-fidelity training simulator for the unmanned aircraft sensor operator, acquired behavioral measures (scan, not scan, over scan, and adaptive target find scores) using simulator-based analysis module, and measured brain activity changes (oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin) from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) using a portable functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) sensor array. The experimental protocol recruited 13 novice participants and had them undergo three easy and two hard sessions to investigate skill acquisition and transfer, respectively. Our results from skill acquisition sessions indicated that performance on both tasks did not change when individual differences were not accounted for. However inclusion of individual differences indicated that some individuals improved only their scan performance (Attention-focused group), while others improved only their target find performance (Accuracy-focused group). Brain activity changes during skill acquisition sessions showed that mental load decreased in the right anterior medial PFC (RAMPFC) in both groups regardless of individual differences. However, mental load increased in the left anterior medial PFC (LAMPFC) of Attention-focused group and decreased in the Accuracy-focused group only when individual differences were included. Transfer results showed no changes in performance regardless of grouping based on individual differences; however, mental load increased in RAMPFC of Attention-focused group and left dorsolateral PFC (LDLPFC) of Accuracy-focused group. Efficiency and involvement results suggest that the Attention-focused group prioritized the scan task, while the Accuracy-focused group prioritized the target find task. In conclusion, training on multitasks results in individual differences. These differences may potentially be due to individual preference. Future studies should incorporate individual differences while assessing skill acquisition and transfer during multitask training.

N2  - Modernizing inhaled medications through digital technology can help address persistent problems of non-adherence and poor inhaler technique in patients with obstructive lung diseases. With a growing body of supportive clinical studies, advances in digital inhaler sensors and platforms, greater support from payers and healthcare organizations, significant growth with these technologies is expected. While all digital (smart) inhalers record adherence, these are distinguished by their compatibility with commercial inhalers, capabilities to guide inhaler technique, use of patient-reported outcomes, and user-friendliness for both the healthcare professional (HCP) and patient. Due to the complexity and novelty of employing digital inhalers, collaboration with multiple entities within health systems is necessary and a well-planned integration is needed. For HCPs and patients, cybersecurity and privacy are critical, it will require review by each healthcare organization. In the US, some payers reimburse for remote monitoring using digital inhalers, but reimbursement is currently unavailable in other countries. There are several models for remote patient care, as employing an active, ongoing digital interface between the HCP and patient or they may choose to only review data at clinical encounters. Personalization of therapies and feedback are key to success. While digital inhaler malfunction uncommonly occurs, patient attrition over a year is significant. Some patients will be challenged to use digital platforms or have the necessary technology. Additional research is needed to address cost-effectiveness, in vivo accuracy of inspiratory measurement capable devices, ability to teach inhaler technique, their application for monitoring lung function, and lastly real-world adoption and implementation in routine clinical practice.

N2  - Hypertension is the most important and modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality worldwide, and a growing issue as the global population with hypertension increases (estimated to be 626 million women and 652 million men in 2019, almost double the number in 1990). In addition, global control rates for hypertension remain poor: 23% for women and 18% for men in 2019 (Lancet. 2021:957). Measures to reduce the number of poorly controlled hypertensive patients are urgently needed. Remarkable advances in healthcare technology have changed healthcare delivery dramatically in the last decade with out-of-office blood pressure (BP) telemonitoring being widely used in clinical research (Hypertension. 2020:1368). We have demonstrated the efficacy of BP telemonitoring and digital intervention for the management of hypertension in the Telemonitoring And Self-Management IN the control of Hypertension (TASMINH) trials (Lancet. 2010:163, JAMA. 2014:799, Lancet. 2018:949), the Home and Online Management and Evaluation of Blood Pressure (HOME BP) trial (BMJ. 2021:m4858), and the HERB Digital Hypertension 1(HERB-DH1) pivotal trial (Eur Heart J. 2021:4111). A recent meta-analysis found that home BP telemonitoring improved office systolic BP (SBP) by 3.99 mmHg and home BP telemonitoring plus additional support (e.g., counselling and medications management) also showed a reduction of office SBP by 2.44 mmHg versus home BP telemonitoring alone (J Hum Hypertens. 2017:427). This evidence suggests that BP telemonitoring is an optimal tool for reducing BP levels and that combining BP telemonitoring and co-interventions would be the most effective approach for the management of hypertension. There are additional benefits from BP telemonitoring system in clinical practice, including assessment of accurate and reliable out-of-office BP data, and ease of BP measurement and recording by patients without the need for manual systems. Furthermore, such systems can reduce nonadherence of antihypertensive medications and clinical inertia, both of which contribute to a treatment-resistant hypertension (J Hypertens. 2017:2346, J Hypertens. 2021:1238). In practical terms, telemonitoring also facilitates optimal BP management for patients living in geographically remote or poorly medically resourced areas (Hypertension. 2021:1927). In this session, through discussion of the evidence base and clinical experience in the UK and Japan, we will examine the prospects of BP telemonitoring systems for the future management of hypertension. We will examine how BP telemonitoring systems are used and affect BP control in both clinical trials and subsequent implementation. In addition, by comparing such work in the UK and Japan, we will assess the potential of BP telemonitoring systems as a solution to the inadequate BP control status worldwide.

N2  - Introduction: Approximately two thirds of intravenous infusions (IVIs) are gravity-based. Serious mistakes can happen easily during standard gravity-based IVIs. The potential economic impact of digital remote monitoring and bedside management of gravity-based IVIs with a novel solution compliant with EU Medical Devices Regulation (MDR) 2017/745 was estimated. Method: An R-based user interface model with the PICOSTEPS framework was developed for the health economic evaluation. Nurses delivering IVIs in 15 wards (6 hospitals, around Finland) were surveyed. The Monidor solutionCE IV infusion management system (including both Monidrop® and IV Screen™, Monidor Oy, Oulu, Finland) was compared to standard gravity-based IVI management in a counterfactual setting. The one-month undiscounted potential economic capacity freed (OMUPECF, in year 2021 euros) and one-month net return on investment (OMNROI) for the healthcare service provider were the outcomes. IVI-related events and nurse time use (linear regression analysis) were included as effects. A tornado diagram depicted the sensitivity of OMNROI to key parameter changes. Results: The survey had 216 responses. 56% of nurses reported time savings, and <4% experienced additional time requirements due to the Monidor solution. On average, the Monidor solution was estimated to avoid 2.06 routine patient room visits, detect end of infusion 1.34 times, and free 5.05 minutes per nurse shift. One routine room visit avoided was associated with 2.45 minutes of freed time in the regression analysis. The ward-based OMUPECF was estimated at €1270 per month (50% related to material savings), yielding an OMNROI of 2.6. The OMNROI ranged from 1.5 to 3.7 in the sensitivity analysis. Discussion and conclusion: Digital remote monitoring and bedside management of gravity-based IVIs with the Monidor solution freed nurse time, saved materials, provided OMUPECF, and resulted in a robustly positive OMNROI in Finland. However, costs between countries can vary, and the results should be confirmed in other settings.

N2  - The recent pandemic with SARS-CoV-2 raises questions worldwide regarding telemedicine for housebound patients, including those with cardiovascular conditions. The need for further investigation, monitoring and therapeutic management are advancing practical issues which had not been identified for consideration prior to the pandemic. Using the marketing assessment, we identified the needs of the patients and evaluated the future steps necessary in the short term to meet them. The research found progress made via telemedicine in monitoring and conducting minor decisions (like up-titrating the doses of different medication regimens) in patients with several cardiovascular diseases (heart failure, atrial fibrillation, high blood pressure), as there is a worldwide trend to develop new telemonitoring biosensors and devices based on implantable delivered transcatheter. The worldwide telemedicine trend encourages a switch from small and hesitating steps to a more consistent assessment of the patients, based on high technology and Interventional Cardiology. Cardiovascular telemedicine, although made a sustainable effort in managing patients' health, has many obstacles to overcome before meeting all their needs. Data security, confidentiality and reimbursement are the top priorities in developing remote Cardiology. The regulatory institutions need to play an integrative role in leading the way for defining the framework of future telemedicine activities. The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak with all its tragedy served to reinforce the message that telemedicine services can be life-saving for cardiovascular patients. Once the Covid-19 era will fade away, telemedicine is likely to remain a complementary service of standard care. There is still room to improve the remote identification and investigation of heart disease, provide an accurate diagnosis and therapeutic regimen, and update regulations and guidelines to the new realities of technological progress in the field.

N2  - Both sulfonamides (SAs) and copper (Cu(II)) were frequently detected together in swine wastewater. In this study, the regulation of Cu(II) on SAs adsorption and release of dissolved organic matters (DOMs) by fungi-microalgae pellets (FM-pellets) were investigated. Aspergillus oryzae pellets were prepared for combination with Chlorella vulgaris and the optimal conditions were at agitation speed of 130 rpm, fungi to microalgae ratio of 10:1 and the combined time of 3 h with the highest combination efficiency of 98.65%. The results showed that adsorption was the main mechanism for SAs removal. FM-pellets exhibited a high SAs adsorption potential within 6 h, and the adsorption capacity of sulfamethazine (SMZ), sulfamonomethoxine (SMM) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) was 1.07, 0.94 and 1.67 mg/g, respectively. Furthermore, the removal of SMX, SMZ and SMM was greatly promoted from 62.31% to 85.21%, 58.71–67.91% and 64.17–80.31%, respectively, under the presence of 2 mg/L Cu(II) through ion exchange and adsorption bridging. DOMs were analyzed by the parallel factor (PARAFAC) to demonstrate the response mechanism of FM-pellets to Cu(II). Protein-like substances and NADH in DOMs released by FM-pellets formed complexes with Cu(II) to alleviate the damage on the organism. These findings provide new insights into the mechanism and response of Cu(II) in the removal of SAs by FM-pellets.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Cetyl palmitate is a wax ester naturally found in sperm whale spermaceti, and it is of importance in the cosmetics industry. International regulations prohibit the sale of sperm whale spermaceti, so it is now being replaced by pure cetyl palmitate obtained by a chemical route or from mixtures based on jojoba oil. Another alternative is to use an enzymatic route for wax ester synthesis. For such a purpose, a new heterogeneous biocatalyst was prepared by our research group via physical adsorption of Burkholderia cepacia lipase on aerogel modified with a protic ionic liquid (IB-IL-OPT). Its catalytic activity was compared with that of a biocatalyst prepared using a non-chemically modified silica aerogel (IB-Control). The objective of this work was to apply this homemade heterogeneous biocatalyst to cetyl palmitate synthesis via a direct esterification reaction in a solvent system and to test the final product as a stabilizing agent in water-in-oil emulsions. RESULTS: IB-IL-OPT achieved maximum acid conversion of 95–100% under optimal experimental conditions established using a central composite rotational design: biocatalyst concentration of 14.8% (w/w), molar ratio of 1:1.3, 41 °C for 15 h of reaction under continuous mechanical agitation (200 rpm). The IB-Control gave 58.8% acid conversion in similar conditions. IB-IL-OPT was successively reused for four cycles. The wax ester showed potential as a good emulsifier for virgin coconut oil. CONCLUSIONS: The cetyl palmitate obtained via an enzymatic route without further purification showed good emulsifying potential, forming Pickering emulsions. This opens new perspectives for study and applications in the cosmetics industry. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry (SCI).

N2  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID) are prevalent in forensic psychiatric samples. People with ASD and/or ID often experience difficulties in emotion processing which can lead to aggressive or self-harming behavior. The use of biocueing (using wearable technology to constantly monitor and provide feedback on bodily changes) shows promise for improving emotion processing and, thus, potentially reducing aggressive behavior in this population. Both qualitative and quantitative methods were used to examine the feasibility and acceptance of Sense-IT, a biocueing application, in a sample of forensic psychiatric patients with ASD and/or ID and their forensic psychiatric nurses. To our knowledge, the current study is the first to examine first-person experiences with biocueing in forensic psychiatric patients with ASD and/or ID. Results show that, in general, participants experienced the biocueing application as positive and are willing to use biocueing. This is an important finding since forensic patients are often unmotivated to engage with therapeutic techniques. An exploration of trends in aggression and self-harm prior to and during the use of biocueing showed no significant changes. Future research should focus on the way biocueing can be implemented in clinical practice.

N2  - Objectives: In hospitals, intravenous infusion (IVI) is a common invasive procedure. 70% of IVIs are gravity-based. When managing IVIs without electronic or digital control, serious mistakes can happen easily. We estimated the potential economic impact of the digital remote monitoring and bedside management of gravity-based IVIs with a novel solution compliant with EU Medical Devices Regulation (MDR 2017/745) and applying for FDA approval. Methods: Using the PICOSTEPS framework, we developed an R-based user interface model for the economic evaluation. Nurses delivering IVIs in 15 wards (6 hospitals) around Finland were surveyed. The CE-marked Monidor solution IV infusion management system (Monidrop® and IV Screen™, Monidor Oy, Oulu, Finland) was compared to standard gravity-based IVI management in a counterfactual setting. Outcomes were the one-month undiscounted potential economic capacity freed (PECF), valued in year 2021 euros, and net return on investment (NROI) for the healthcare service provider. Effects included IVI-related events and nurse time use (linear regression analysis). Sensitivity of NROI was illustrated in a tornado diagram. Results: 216 survey responses were obtained. Less than 4% of nurses experienced additional time requirements due to the Monidor solution, and 56% reported time savings. On average, the Monidor solution saved 2.06 routine patient room visits, detected end of infusion 1.34 times, and freed 5.05 minutes per nurse shift. In the regression, one routine room visit avoided was associated with 2.45 minutes of freed time. The ward-based PECF was €1270 per month (50% related to material savings), yielding an NROI of 2.6. In the sensitivity analysis, the NROI ranged from 1.5 to 3.7. Conclusions: The remote monitoring of IVIs with the Monidor solution freed nurse time, saved materials, provided PECF, and resulted in a robustly positive NROI in Finland. However, processes and costs between settings can vary, and the results should be confirmed in other countries.

N2  - The Drugs & Cosmetic act is meant to regularize safety & quality of medical devices, which is applied to all medical devices, implemented from 1st April 2020. Earlier 37 medical devices were regulated/ notified in India. The present study focuses on the devices which require regulations but still lack the quality check points for scrutiny from Central Drug standard control organization (CDSCO), Delhi. Furthermore, it aims to provide quality checklist for two upcoming devices (Ventilator) which is neither categorized nor regulated by Central Drug standard control organization, Delhi. Since the medical devices aid in diagnosing, treatment and palliative care, it is essential to check the quality such that it matches with the International standards. Post covid-19 outbreak ventilators have come under surveillance and notified as medical devices. The present study monitors all parameters for regulation of the ventilator. The survey based quality & regulation standards for ventilator as medical devices has been incorporated in this study.

N2  - Background and Aims: Chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are the main cause of hospitalizations, disability, and death in Brazil. The increased prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) combined with the complexity of their treatment, reinforces the need for effective and feasible educational programs for public health services. We evaluate the clinical impact of an educational program via mobile phone on metabolic control of individuals with T2DM. Methods: This study was an open-label, parallel-group trial, involving patients diagnosed with T2DM regularly seen at the Family Health Clinic, in Rio de Janeiro/Brazil. Ethical approval for this study was granted by the SecretariaMunicipal de Sańde do Rio de Janeiro Ethics Committee. Patients with diabetes were randomly allocated into 2 groups: intervention group (received a backpack containing health care devices and a mobile phone for remote monitoring provided with educational material for diabetes) or control group (standard of care). All outcome measures were collected at baseline and after a 3- month period. Changes in HbA1c were compared between groups using the modified Wald test. Results: a total of 360 patients completed the study (174intervention, 183 control group). The study included 65% of women, who were a mean (SD) age of 64,28 (11,38). There was a significant decrease in weight (p < 0.05), waist circumference (p < 0.01), Body Mass Index (p < 0.01), and glycated hemoglobin (p < 0.01) when comparing before and after the intervention. Conclusions: Mobile phone apps are an effective component to help glycemic control and could be considered an affordable and widely available adjuvant intervention to the standard selfmanagement for patients with T2DM.

N2  - Background: The International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) is undertaking a major revision of ICH E6 Good Clinical Practice (GCP) decided to involve external stakeholders in ICH-GCP renovation. Activities such as surveys and public conferences have taken place in the United States, European Union, and Japan. For stakeholder engagement in Japan, a designated research group conducted a survey of academic stakeholders. Methods: A total of 105 academic stakeholders from 18 institutions responded to the survey. The research group developed recommendations reflecting the survey results and the opinions from patients and the public. Results: The survey showed the top four principles needing renovation were (i) informed consent (Chapter 2.9, 12.4% of respondents believed it needed renovation), (ii) systems for quality assurance (Chapter 2.13, 9.5%), (iii) information on an investigational product (Chapter 2.4, 5.7%), and (iv) procedures on clinical trial information (Chapter 2.10, 5.7%). The top three sections identified as needing renovation were: (i) informed consent (Chapter 4.8, 27.6%), (ii) monitoring (Chapter 5.18, 22.9%), and (iii) composition, functions, and operations of the ethics committee (Chapter 3.2, 14.3%). Recommendations included clarification of ICH-GCP’s scope, proportionality in various aspects of clinical trials, diversity and liquidity of ethics committee members, modernization of informed consent procedures, variations in monitoring, and regulatory grade when using real-world data. Conclusion: The recommendations from Japanese investigators and patients have been submitted to the ICH E6 Expert Working Group, which will strengthen the robustness of the GCP renovation.

N2  - Digital health tools encompass a wide range of technologies that have been used in healthcare services including mobile applications, health information technology, smart wearable devices, remote monitoring and treatment, and health platforms. These tools walk a fine line between lifestyle consumer products and medical devices. Sleep applications can be used by consumers as a fun gadget to track sleep, but it may also be used as a medical tool to collect information concerning serious sleep disorders. The fast proliferation of these tools has put pressure on concerned stakeholders to make sense of this group of technologies. Various questions have been raised within this realm: What counts as medical as opposed to a lifestyle device? Which devices require regulation and under what standards? Which devices are allowed to be used in the medical context? And which are not? And under what conditions? Social scientists have highlighted the complexity of digital health tools that (include both medical and lifestyle characteristics and the difficulties accompanied with classifying these tools for regulatory purposes. In an attempt to do so, several regulatory bodies including the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have revised their existing standards to accommodate the regulation of digital health tools. As such, the FDA published a guidance document on Mobile Medical Applications; this led to various concerns questioning the boundaries between lifestyle and medical digital technologies that were defined by the FDA guidelines, which left a significant number of technologies that were considered to be low-risk, completely out of the FDA oversight and with no required compliance/quality control/effectiveness checks. This prompted many companies to develop hundreds of products that belong to the low-risk category, granting them the ability to ignore FDA regulations. Consequently, there remains considerable concern regarding the quality and safety of these digital health technologies that are being used within the medical context. Clear and well-defined regulation processes are needed to control the development and design of these tools, especially that many lack scientific evidence and data privacy. The framework ought to include a risk-based approach to classify devices for regulation in a way to ensure the safety and effectiveness of all digital health tools throughout their life cycle, even those classified as low-risk. The framework and regulatory process also need to take into consideration the rapid change in digital product development, as processes that extend for a long period of time may become obsolete in supporting decisions about these tools. As these digital health tools become more sophisticated, accessible, widespread, and cheaper, the need for classifying and regulating the sector becomes important, especially with the rapid evolution of these technologies.

N2  - Objectives: Novel technologies offering remote patient monitoring have the potential to ease institutional stresses and promote efficiency. Rapid evolution of healthcare monitoring technologies will create a need for reimbursement for active interventions (e.g., device optimisation, remote follow-up) to ensure optimum follow-up care. This study looked at the challenges of reimbursement for novel technologies within existing funding framework. Methods: Secondary research identified reimbursement and funding mechanisms for new medical devices in France, Germany, and the UK. The challenges of reimbursement for innovative devices within existing regulatory framework is summarised. Results: The billing of services for treating patients using medical devices is mainly based on the Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) payment system; however, each country has its own modification of the system. Although the services and tariff under DRG systems are revised annually, obtaining and updating component procedural codes (CCAM in France, OPCS in England, and OPS in Germany) to support adequate reimbursement for a new treatment are prolonged and expensive processes requiring evidence generation and involving multiple stakeholders. New devices are reimbursed under existing DRG-based codes, making this type of reimbursement insufficient for new higher-cost innovations. Discretionary funding mechanisms are also in place to temporarily reimburse new devices (e.g., New Diagnostic and Treatment Methods Regulation [NUB] reimbursement in Germany). Prices of medical devices reimbursed under DRG systems are typically negotiated between hospitals and manufacturers. The budget allocation is not based on payment by results but by a fixed budget distribution system negotiated between payer and provider. Conclusions: The DRG-based payment system in its current form is not compatible with newer technologies looking for fee-per-case type of payment model. A DRG system which has been adapted to suit each healthcare market should adopt a payment modality that encourages efficient use of healthcare resources.

N2  - Background: Digitalization of healthcare led to the optimization of monitoring, diagnostics, and treatment of the range of disorders. Taking into account recent situation with COVID-19 pandemics, digital technologies allowed to improve management of viral infections via remote monitoring and diagnostics of infected patients. Up to date, various mobile health applications (apps) have been proposed, including apps for the patients diagnosed with cardiovascular pathologies. Objective: The presented review aimed at the analyses of a range of mHealth solutions used to improve primary cardiac care. In addition, we studied the factors driving and hindering the wide introduction of mHealth services in the clinics. Methods: The work was based on the guidelines of the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. The publication search was carried out using PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases. Studies published during the period from 2014 until January 2022 were selected for the analysis. The evaluation of risk of bias for the included studies was conducted using the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias tool. Results and Discussion: An overall 5513 studies were assessed for eligibility after which 39 studies were included. The main trend in the mobile health for cardiological applications is the use of different types of wearable devices and Artificial Intelligence-platforms. In fact, mobile technology allows remotely to monitor, interpret, and analyze biomedical data collected from the patient. Conclusion: The results of this literature search demonstrated that patients diagnosed with cardiovascular disorders can potentially benefit from the application of mHealth in cardiology. However, despite the proven advantages of mHealth for cardiology, there are many challenges and concerns regarding effectiveness, safety, reliability and the lack of official regulation and guidelines from official organizations. Such issues require solutions and further work towards a wide implementation of mHealth technologies in cardiac practice.

N2  - Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) continues to cause poor clinical outcomes due to limited advances in sustained treatments for rapid cancer cell proliferation and progression. The transcriptional factor Forkhead Box M1 (FOXM1) regulates cell proliferation, tumor initiation, and progression in multiple cancer types. However, its biological function and clinical significance in SCLC remain unestablished. Analysis of the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia and SCLC datasets in the present study disclosed significant upregulation of FOXM1 mRNA in SCLC cell lines and tissues. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that FOXM1 is positively correlated with pathways regulating cell proliferation and DNA damage repair, as evident from sensitization of FOXM1-depleted SCLC cells to chemotherapy. Furthermore, Foxm1 knockout inhibited SCLC formation in the Rb1fl/flTrp53fl/flMycLSL/LSL (RPM) mouse model associated with increased levels of neuroendocrine markers, Ascl1 and Cgrp, and decrease in Yap1. Consistently, FOXM1 depletion in NCI-H1688 SCLC cells reduced migration and enhanced apoptosis and sensitivity to cisplatin and etoposide. SCLC with high FOXM1 expression (N = 30, 57.7%) was significantly correlated with advanced clinical stage, extrathoracic metastases, and decrease in overall survival (OS), compared with the low-FOXM1 group (7.90 vs. 12.46 months). Moreover, the high-FOXM1 group showed shorter progression-free survival after standard chemotherapy, compared with the low-FOXM1 group (3.90 vs. 8.69 months). Our collective findings support the utility of FOXM1 as a prognostic biomarker and potential molecular target for SCLC.

N2  - One of the targets of the Sustainable Development Goals is clean and affordable energy. This is also the aim of the Biofuels Act of 2007 in the Philippines. However, this law is confronted with challenges such as the limitation of lignocellulosic feedstock, specifically available for bioethanol production. The present study sought to address the issue by exploring the potential of mango seed husk (MSH), a by-product of the mango industry, in bioethanol production. MSH is considered a waste material and its utilization also permit value-addition as this can serve as an alternative and affordable source of feedstock in energy production. Two pretreatment strategies are employed to exploit the cellulose and hemicellulose content of MSH, namely, dilute acid treatment and enzymatic hydrolysis. Results show that the %H2SO4 resulting in the highest glucose concentration and yield is 4% v/v at 95 °C hydrolysis temperature, 1:10 (w/v) solid-to-solvent ratio, and 60-min hydrolysis time. For enzymatic hydrolysis using a commercial enzyme preparation, the reaction time up to 72 h did not affect glucose concentration and yield at the following conditions: 50 °C hydrolysis temperature, 150 rpm, pH 5.0, 10% solids loading, and 4% enzyme loading. This could be attributed to the lignin and non-structural compounds present in MSHs. However, a combined process strategy of dilute acid pretreatment followed by enzymatic hydrolysis in the pretreatment of MSH contributes to an increased concentration and yield of sugars in the hydrolysates, which is advantageous for bioethanol production.

N2  - Treatment for substance use disorder (SUD) during the COVID-19 pandemic poses unique challenges, both due to direct effects from the illness, and indirect effects from the physical measures needed to “flatten the curve.” Stress, isolation, lack of structure, limited access to physical and mental health care, and changes in treatment paradigms all increase risk of return to drug use events and pose barriers to recovery for people with SUDs. The pandemic has forced treatment providers and facilities to rapidly adapt to address these threats while redesigning their structure to accommodate physical distancing regulations. Digital health interventions can function without the need for physical proximity. Clinicians can use digital health intervention, such as telehealth, wearables, mobile applications, and other remote monitoring devices, to convert in-person care to remote-based care, and they can leverage these tools to address some of the pandemic-specific challenges to treatment. The current pandemic provides the opportunity to rapidly explore the advantages and limitations of these technologies in the care of individuals with SUD.

N2  - Patient groups are non-profit organizations that focus on the needs of people affected by a specific disease. Over the years, patient groups have assumed an increasingly decisive role in the healthcare decision-making process, and may influence the governments' decisions on key crucial health matters. Financial support for patient groups can come from different sources, including the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. Although patient groups may certainly benefit from drug companies economic support, in this commentary we address concerns regarding the presence of potential conflict of interests (COIs), which may affect the independence, objectivity, integrity and reputation of the organizations.

N2  - One of the main precursors of air pollution and acid rains is the presence of the recalcitrant thiophenic compounds, for example dibenzothiophene (DBT) and its derivatives in transportation fuels. In an attempt to achieve the worldwide regulations of ultra-low sulfur transportation fuels without affecting its hydrocarbon skeleton, a biphasic medium containing 100 mg/L DBT dissolved in n-hexadecane (1/4 oil/water v/v) used for enrichment and isolation of selective biodesulfurizing bacterium from an oil-polluted sediment sample collected from Egyptian Red Sea shoreline. The isolated bacterium is facultative anaerobe, motile, spore-former, and mesophile. It is genetically identified as Paenibacillus glucanolyticus strain HN4 (NCBI Gene Bank Accession No. MT645230). HN4 desulfurized DBT as a model of the recalcitrant thiophenic compounds without affecting its hydrocarbon skeleton via the 4S-pathway producing 2-hydroxybiphenyl (2-HBP) as a dead end product. HN4 substantiated to be a hydrocarbon tolerant, biosurfactants(s) producer, and endorsed unique enzymatic system capable of desulfurizing broad range of thiophenic compounds and expressed an efficient desulfurization activity against the recalcitrant alkylated DBTs. As far our knowledge, it is the first reported BDS study using P. glucanolyticus. Statistical optimization based on One-Factor-At-A-Time (OFAT) technique and response surface methodology (RSM) applied for elucidation of mathematical model correlations describing and optimizing the effect of different physicochemical parameters on batch biphasic BDS process. That illustrated an approximate increase in BDS efficiency by 1.34 fold and recorded 94% sulfur removal in biphasic batch process at optimum operation conditions of 120 h, 0.14 wt% S-content model oil (DBT dissolved in n-hexadecane), 33.5 °C, pH7 and 1/1 oil/water phase ratio, and 147 rpm. Resting cells of HN4 in a biphasic reactor (1/1 v/v) decreased the sulfur content of a refractory thiophenic model oil (thiophene, benzothiophene, DBT, and alkylated DBT dissolved in n-hexadecane) from 0.14 to 0.027 wt%, and petro-diesel from 0.2 to 0.04 wt%, within 120 h, keeping the calorific value of the treated fuel intact. Consequently, that novel strain could be recommended as a promising candidate for BDS as complementary to hydrodesulfurization process in oil refinery.

N2  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus has rapidly involved the entire world and exposed the pressing need for collaboration between public health and other stakeholders from the clinical, scientific, regulatory, pharmaceutical, and medical device and technology communities. To discuss how to best protect people with diabetes from serious outcomes from COVID-19, Diabetes Technology Society, in collaboration with Sansum Diabetes Research Institute, hosted the “International COVID-19 and Diabetes Virtual Summit” on August 26-27, 2020. This unique, unprecedented real-time conference brought together physicians, scientists, government officials, regulatory experts, industry representatives, and people with diabetes from six continents to review and analyze relationships between COVID-19 and diabetes. Over 800 attendees logged in. The summit consisted of five sessions: (I) Keynotes, (II) Preparedness, (III) Response, (IV) Recovery, and (V) Surveillance; eight parts: (A) Background, (B) Resilience, (C) Outpatient Care, (D) Inpatient Care, (E) Resources, (F) High-Risk Groups, (G) Regulation, and (H) The Future; and 24 sections: (1) Historic Pandemics and Impact on Society, (2) Pathophysiology/Risk Factors for COVID-19, (3) Social Determinants of COVID-19, (4) Preparing for the Future, (5) Medications and Vaccines, (6) Psychology of Patients and Caregivers, (7) Outpatient Treatment of Diabetes Mellitus and Non-Pharmacologic Intervention, (8) Technology and Telehealth for Diabetes Outpatients, (9) Technology for Inpatients, (10) Management of Diabetes Inpatients with COVID-19, (11) Ethics, (12) Accuracy of Diagnostic Tests, (13) Children, (14) Pregnancy, (15) Economics of Care for COVID-19, (16) Role of Industry, (17) Protection of Healthcare Workers, (18) People with Diabetes, (19) International Responses to COVID-19, (20) Government Policy, (21) Regulation of Tests and Treatments, (22) Digital Health Technology, (23) Big Data Statistics, and 24) Patient Surveillance and Privacy. The two keynote speeches were entitled (1) COVID-19 and Diabetes—Meeting the Challenge and (2) Knowledge Gaps and Research Opportunities for Diabetes and COVID-19. While there was an emphasis on diabetes and its interactions with COVID-19, the panelists also discussed the COVID-19 pandemic in general. The meeting generated many novel ideas for collaboration between experts in medicine, science, government, and industry to develop new technologies and disease treatment paradigms to fight this global pandemic.

N2  - Numerous guidelines and recommendations reinforce the important role of healthcare providers promoting physical activity (PA) through assessment, prescription, and referral. This paper summarizes what is required to accomplish these actions as a standard of care. The sections describe the importance of measurement development and standardization, the integration of PA into the care continuum, suggested roles and responsibilities for the healthcare team, the role of technology and telehealth in promoting PA, connecting patients to different PA modalities and settings, a summary of the overall regulatory and policy plan to accomplish integration of PA into delivery of care, and areas for future research. Integrating PA assessment, prescription, and referral into delivery of care requires a multi-stakeholder, coordinated effort with government agencies, payers, non-governmental organizations, professional societies, the United States Congress, state legislatures, healthcare systems, and the healthcare industry.

N2  - Policy Points Millions of life-sustaining implantable devices collect and relay massive amounts of digital health data, increasingly by using user-downloaded smartphone applications to facilitate data relay to clinicians via manufacturer servers. Our analysis of health privacy laws indicates that most US patients may have little access to their own digital health data in the United States under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Privacy Rule, whereas the EU General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act grant greater access to device-collected data. Our normative analysis argues for consistently granting patients access to the raw data collected by their implantable devices. Context: Millions of life-sustaining implantable devices collect and relay massive amounts of digital health data, increasingly by using user-downloaded smartphone applications to facilitate data relay to clinicians via manufacturer servers. Whether patients have either legal or normative claims to data collected by these devices, particularly in the raw, granular format beyond that summarized in their medical records, remains incompletely explored. Methods: Using pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) as a clinical model, we outline the clinical ecosystem of data collection, relay, retrieval, and documentation. We consider the legal implications of US and European privacy regulations for patient access to either summary or raw device data. Lastly, we evaluate ethical arguments for or against providing patients access to data beyond the summaries presented in medical records. Findings: Our analysis of applicable health privacy laws indicates that US patients may have little access to their raw data collected and held by device manufacturers in the United States under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Privacy Rule, whereas the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) grants greater access to device-collected data when the processing of personal data falls under the GDPR's territorial scope. The California Consumer Privacy Act, the “little sister” of the GDPR, also grants greater rights to California residents. By contrast, our normative analysis argues for consistently granting patients access to the raw data collected by their implantable devices. Smartphone applications are increasingly involved in the collection, relay, retrieval, and documentation of these data. Therefore, we argue that smartphone user agreements are an emerging but potentially underutilized opportunity for clarifying both legal and ethical claims for device-derived data. Conclusions: Current health privacy legislation incompletely supports patients’ normative claims for access to digital health data.

N2  - Sugar alcohols are the prominent alternatives of sugars in food, medical, and health industries. The ruthenium supported on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (Ru/MWCNTs) catalysts were prepared based on the Ru valence regulation strategy and applied for selective sugar hydrogenation to prepare various sugar alcohols including xylitol, arabinitol, sorbitol, mannitol, and galactitol for the first time, with high selectivity (>99.0%) and yield (>98.0%) under mild conditions (≤110 °C, 3.0 MPa H2 pressure). The hydrogenation reaction of xylose was further optimized and under mild conditions (100 °C, 3.0 MPa H2 pressure, and 500 rpm), which were lower than ever reported for high efficient synthesis of xylitol, 99.8% xylose conversion and 99.0% xylitol yield were achieved after 120 min of reaction.

N2  - The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic has shifted how many patients receive outpatient care. Telehealth and remote monitoring have become more prevalent, and measurements taken in a patient’s home using biometric monitoring technologies (BioMeTs) offer convenient opportunities to collect vital sign data. Healthcare providers may lack prior experience using BioMeTs in remote patient care, and, therefore, may be unfamiliar with the many versions of BioMeTs, novel data collection protocols, and context of the values collected. To make informed patient care decisions based on the biometric data collected remotely, it is important to understand the engineering solutions embedded in the products, data collection protocols, form factors (physical size and shape), data quality considerations, and availability of validation information. This article provides an overview of BioMeTs available for collecting vital signs (temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and respiratory rate) and discusses the strengths and limitations of continuous monitoring. We provide considerations for remote data collection and sources of validation information to guide BioMeT use in the era of COVID-19 and beyond.

N2  - Menaquinone-7 (MK-7) is an important kind of vitamin K2 which plays significant roles in the treatment of coagulation and osteoporosis, and prevention of cardiovascular disease. This work was purposed to study the differences of gene expression at different oxygen supply conditions in Bacillus natto. The differences of fermentation characteristics, gene expression related to MK-7 biosynthesis, spore and biofilm formation were analyzed. The yield of MK-7 increased by two fold under high oxygen supply condition of 200 rpm. Further transcriptome analysis indicated that most of the enzymes in MK-7 biosynthesis pathway were also up-regulated. Moreover, glycerol kinase, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase and phosphofructokinase in glycolysis pathway were all up-regulated indicating that high oxygen supply can increase the consumption of substrate glycerol. Meanwhile, menD, encoded the rate-limiting enzyme in the MK pathway, was obviously up-regulated by 3.49-fold while most of the enzymes related to spore formation were down regulated at 200 rpm. Besides, superoxide dismutase (SOD2), catalase (CAT), hydroperoxide reductase (AhpF) and DNA-binding protein MrgA in the antioxidant defense system were up-regulated, while superoxide dismutase (SOD1) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were down-regulated. These results could contribute to a better understanding for the effect of oxygen on the MK-7 production in Bacillus natto, and further analyze the molecular regulation mechanism of MK-7 biosynthesis.

N2  - Innovative ways of healthcare delivery like m-Health, the practice of medicine by mobile devices and wearable devices are the promising new technique that may lead to improvement in quality of care at lower costs. While fully acknowledging the importance of m-Health development, there are challenges on privacy legislation. We address the legal framework, especially the General Data Protection Regulation, applied to m-Health and its implications for m-Health developments in Europe. We discuss how these rules are applied using a representative example of an m-Health programme with remote monitoring in the Netherlands. We consider informing patients about the data processing and obtaining their explicit consent as main responsibilities of healthcare providers introducing m-Health in their practice.

N2  - SIGNIFICANCE: The COVID-19 pandemic is changing the landscape of healthcare delivery in many countries, with a new shift toward remote patient monitoring (RPM). AIM: The goal of this perspective is to highlight the existing and future role of wearable and RPM optical technologies in an increasingly at-home healthcare and research environment. APPROACH: First, the specific changes occurring during the COVID-19 pandemic in healthcare delivery, regulations, and technological innovations related to RPM technologies are reviewed. Then, a review of the current state and potential future impact of optical physiological monitoring in portable and wearable formats is outlined. RESULTS: New efforts from academia, industry, and regulatory agencies are advancing and encouraging at-home, portable, and wearable physiological monitors as a growing part of healthcare delivery. It is hoped that these shifts will assist with disease diagnosis, treatment, management, recovery, and rehabilitation with minimal in-person contact. Some of these trends are likely to persist for years to come. Optical technologies already account for a large portion of RPM platforms, with a good potential for future growth. CONCLUSIONS: The biomedical optics community has a potentially large role to play in developing, testing, and commercializing new wearable and RPM technologies to meet the changing healthcare and research landscape in the COVID-19 era and beyond.

N2  - Mobile applications provide the healthcare industry with a means of connecting with patients in their own home utilizing their own personal mobile devices such as tablets and phones. This allows therapists to monitor the progress of people under their care from a remote location and all with the added benefit that patients are familiar with their own mobile devices; thereby reducing the time required to train patients with the new technology. There is also the added benefit to the health service that there is no additional cost required to purchase devices for use. The Facial Remote Activity Monitoring Eyewear (FRAME) mobile application and web service framework has been designed to work on the IOS and android platforms, the two most commonly used today. Results: The system utilizes secure cloud based data storage to collect, analyse and store data, this allows for near real time, secure access remotely by therapists to monitor their patients and intervene when required. The underlying framework has been designed to be secure, anonymous and flexible to ensure compliance with the data protection act and the latest General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR); this new standard came into effect in April 2018 and replaces the Data Protection Act in the UK and Europe.

N2  - Electronic-based health care delivery systems are gaining popularity among patients and clinicians because of convenience. Importantly, telemedicine, the delivery of health care and/or health information using electronic systems, can deliver primary and specialized health care to geographically isolated patients, who account for nearly 20% of the US population. In nephrology, where a growing discrepancy exists between the geographic location of nephrologists and patients with kidney disease, telenephrology can bridge distance and deliver renal care and education to the isolated. Large nationalized health care systems, for which incentives are aligned to innovate and implement new platforms to deliver cost-effective care, have been at the forefront of telenephrology. These systems include synchronous direct physician-patient care through clinical videoconferencing, and asynchronous modalities such as electronic consultation and video telehealth to educate internists about specialized clinical topics. Large health care organizations are adopting these platforms as standalone services; however, expansion into the private health care system has been limited by reimbursement, regulations, and other issues. Though telenephrology is patient centered, studies are needed to rigorously test its clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness. Nonetheless, growing patient demand for patient-centric health care will continue to expand the telenephrology space.

N2  - Parkinson's disease is a neuro-degenerative disorder characterized by the progressive death of dopamine neurons. This leads to delayed and uncoordinated movements, and impacts on the patients’ motor performance with reduced movement intensity, increased axial rigidity and impaired cadence regulation. Turning provides privileged insights in postural instability and fall prediction, as it is regularly performed during daily activities, requires multi-limb coordination. The objective of this work was to define a Quality of Movement (QoM) index, inferred from inertial data related to turns, and strictly correlated with the patient's motor conditions, postural stability, and stage of the disease. Such a concise representation finds its main application in the remote monitoring of patients during daily activities at home. We have recorded and analyzed 180° turns in 72 patients, using inertial sensors embedded in the smartphone. We have set up an algorithm for binary classification of patients: mild vs. moderate/severe conditions, according to the Hoehn and Yahr scale of disease progression and disability degree. Our QoM index is defined as the a posteriori probability output by this binary classifier. It exhibits high correlation (r = 0.73) with the clinical score of postural stability, as well as with the average of four clinical scores related to movement impairment (r = 0.75). These results, together with the widespread smartphone use, provide a step in the direction of a practical, objective and reliable tool for PD patients remote monitoring in domestic environment.

N2  - Purpose: The latest version of the continuous flow total artificial heart (CFTAH), which incorporates a novel stacked motor to improve passive self-regulation of pressure difference between the left and right atria, and reduce pump rotor over-excursion, was tested in vivo in a calf model to assess operational performance. Methods: The CFTAH was implanted in a calf and run at various pump operating conditions including mean pump speeds from 2400 to 3600 RPM, sinusoidal speed modulations from 0 to 25%, and speed modulation rates from 80 to 120 B.M. It was also tested under various combinations of simulated high and low systemic vascular resistance and pulmonary vascular resistance via outlet graft clamping and administration of a Nitroprusside respectively. Results: The CFTAH responded to all control inputs and ran as expected during the experiment. The head curves of the right and left pumps generated from measured pressures, measured right flow and calculated left flow, were consistent with in vitro data on this pump. The passive atrial pressure regulation performed well in the normal operating range, and there were no signs of excessive rotor axial displacement during extreme pressure excursions as had been seen in the previous versions of the pump. The left atrial pressure was unusually low throughout most of the experiment and we believe that this may have been due to partial blockage of the of the left inflow cuff proximal to the pressure line tap. This led to several left inlet suction conditions and extreme pressure conditions. Conclusion: The replacement of the standard, single stack stator motor with the new dual stator stack motor resulted in better passive regulation of the pressure difference between the left and right atria. Also, the extreme pressure conditions resulting from left inlet suction events did not cause the pump's rotor to rub against the volute housing as had been seen in previous versions of the pump. Even though the self-regulation was acceptable, shifting of the regulation characteristic to increase the nominal LAP-RAP value will improve the regulation further, and this modification will be implemented prior to the next in vivo experiment.
