N2  - As the burgeoning field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to permeate the fabric of healthcare, particularly in the realms of patient surveillance and telemedicine, a transformative era beckons. This manuscript endeavors to unravel the intricacies of recent AI advancements and their profound implications for reconceptualizing the delivery of medical care. Through the introduction of innovative instruments such as virtual assistant chatbots, wearable monitoring devices, predictive analytic models, personalized treatment regimens, and automated appointment systems, AI is not only amplifying the quality of care but also empowering patients and fostering a more interactive dynamic between the patient and the healthcare provider. Yet, this progressive infiltration of AI into the healthcare sphere grapples with a plethora of challenges hitherto unseen. The exigent issues of data security and privacy, the specter of algorithmic bias, the requisite adaptability of regulatory frameworks, and the matter of patient acceptance and trust in AI solutions demand immediate and thoughtful resolution .The importance of establishing stringent and far-reaching policies, ensuring technological impartiality, and cultivating patient confidence is paramount to ensure that AI-driven enhancements in healthcare service provision remain both ethically sound and efficient. In conclusion, we advocate for an expansion of research efforts aimed at navigating the ethical complexities inherent to a technology-evolving landscape, catalyzing policy innovation, and devising AI applications that are not only clinically effective but also earn the trust of the patient populace. By melding expertise across disciplines, we stand at the threshold of an era wherein AI's role in healthcare is both ethically unimpeachable and conducive to elevating the global health quotient.

N2  - Categorizing Artificial Intelligence of Medical Things (AIoMT) devices within the realm of standard Internet of Things (IoT) and Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices, particularly at the server and computational layers, poses a formidable challenge. In this paper, we present a novel methodology for categorizing AIoMT devices through the application of decentralized processing, referred to as "Federated Learning" (FL). Our approach involves deploying a system on standard IoT devices and labeled IoMT devices for training purposes and attribute extraction. Through this process, we extract and map the interconnected attributes from a global federated cum aggression server. The aim of this terminology is to extract interdependent devices via federated learning, ensuring data privacy and adherence to operational policies. Consequently, a global training dataset repository is coordinated to establish a centralized indexing and synchronization knowledge repository. The categorization process employs generic labels for devices transmitting medical data through regular communication channels. We evaluate our proposed methodology across a variety of IoT, IoMT, and AIoMT devices, demonstrating effective classification and labeling. Our technique yields a reliable categorization index for facilitating efficient access and optimization of medical devices within global servers.

N2  - IoT has seen remarkable growth, particularly in healthcare, leading to the rise of IoMT. IoMT integrates medical devices for real-time data analysis and transmission but faces challenges in data security and interoperability. This research identifies a significant gap in the existing literature regarding a comprehensive ontology for vulnerabilities in medical IoT devices. This paper proposes a fundamental domain ontology named MIoT (Medical Internet of Things) ontology, focusing on cybersecurity in IoMT (Internet of Medical Things), particularly in remote patient monitoring settings. This research will refer to similar-looking acronyms, IoMT and MIoT ontology. It is important to distinguish between the two. IoMT is a collection of various medical devices and their applications within the research domain. On the other hand, MIoT ontology refers to the proposed ontology that defines various concepts, roles, and individuals. MIoT ontology utilizes the knowledge engineering methodology outlined in Ontology Development 101, along with the structured life cycle, and establishes semantic interoperability among medical devices to secure IoMT assets from vulnerabilities and cyberattacks. By defining key concepts and relationships, it becomes easier to understand and analyze the complex network of information within the IoMT. The MIoT ontology captures essential key terms and security-related entities for future extensions. A conceptual model is derived from the MIoT ontology and validated through a case study. Furthermore, this paper outlines a roadmap for future research, highlighting potential impacts on security automation in healthcare applications.

N2  - Introduction: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an increasingly prevalent chronic, autoimmune, and inflammatory central nervous system illness, whose common symptoms undermine the quality of life of patients and their families. Recent technical breakthroughs potentially offer continuous, reliable, sensitive, and objective remote monitoring solutions for healthcare. Wearables can be useful for evaluating falls, fatigue, sedentary behavior, exercise, and sleep quality in people with MS (PwMS). Objective: This scoping review of relevant literature explores studies investigating the perceptions of patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs) about the use of wearable technologies in the management of MS. Methods: The Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for scoping reviews was used. The search strategy was applied to the databases, MEDLINE via Ovid, Embase, APA PsycInfo, and CINAHL. Further searches were performed in IEEE, Scopus, and Web of Science. The review considered studies reporting quantitative or qualitative data on perceptions and experiences of PwMS and HCPs concerning wearables’ usability, satisfaction, barriers, and facilitators. Results: 10 studies were included in this review. Wearables’ usefulness and accessibility, ease of use, awareness, and motivational tool potential were patient-perceived facilitators of use. Barriers related to anxiety and frustration, complexity, and the design of wearables. Perceived usefulness and system requirements are identified as facilitators of using wearables by HCPs, while data security concerns and fears of increased workload and limited effectiveness in the care plan are identified as barriers to use wearables. Conclusions: This review contributes to our understanding of the benefits of wearable technologies in MS by exploring perceptions of both PwMS and HCPs. The scoping review provided a broad overview of facilitators and barriers to wearable use in MS. There is a need for further studies underlined with sound theoretical frameworks to provide a robust evidence-base for the optimal use of wearables to empower healthcare users and providers.

N2  - Recent advances in smartphones and remote monitoring based on the Internet of Things (IoT) have enabled improved multidimensional intelligent services. The advent of IoT-based wearable and multimedia sensors has prevented millions of mishapsthrough seamless and systematic monitoring. An IoT-based monitoring system is composed of several sensor devices to measure vital signs, fall detection, energy consumption, and visual recognition. As the data collected by the sensors are transmitted to cloud storage through the Internet, data security is a major concern when transmitting data from remote locations. To improve data security and prediction accuracy, in this study, we proposed a smart and secure multimedia IoT monitoring system for smart homes backed up by smart grid supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA). The proposed system employs state-of-the-art IoT microcontrollers and hardware devices and integrates them in a manner that significantly affects the accuracy and speed of the entire system. Furthermore, the information gathered from IoT is securely transferred through private channels and stored on the cloud, which can be accessed authentically and reliably using an information system built into an IoT application. The output was extensively compared in terms of power consumption and delivery ratio, which were based on the values collected with sequence numbers. The comparative analysis demonstrated that the proposed approach provides increased prediction accuracy and better security. Hence, the proposed powerefficient prototype model monitors the entire smart home environment in real time and serves as an early warning system for critical situations.

T1  - PUFchain 3.0: Hardware-Assisted Distributed Ledger for Robust Authentication in Healthcare Cyber-Physical Systems
LA  - English
N2  - This article presents a novel hardware-assisted distributed ledger-based solution for simultaneous device and data security in smart healthcare. This article presents a novel architecture that integrates PUF, blockchain, and Tangle for Security-by-Design (SbD) of healthcare cyber-physical systems (H-CPSs). Healthcare systems around the world have undergone massive technological transformation and have seen growing adoption with the advancement of Internet-of-Medical Things (IoMT). The technological transformation of healthcare systems to telemedicine, e-health, connected health, and remote health is being made possible with the sophisticated integration of IoMT with machine learning, big data, artificial intelligence (AI), and other technologies. As healthcare systems are becoming more accessible and advanced, security and privacy have become pivotal for the smooth integration and functioning of various systems in H-CPSs. In this work, we present a novel approach that integrates PUF with IOTA Tangle and blockchain and works by storing the PUF keys of a patient's Body Area Network (BAN) inside blockchain to access, store, and share globally. Each patient has a network of smart wearables and a gateway to obtain the physiological sensor data securely. To facilitate communication among various stakeholders in healthcare systems, IOTA Tangle's Masked Authentication Messaging (MAM) communication protocol has been used, which securely enables patients to communicate, share, and store data on Tangle. The MAM channel works in the restricted mode in the proposed architecture, which can be accessed using the patient's gateway PUF key. Furthermore, the successful verification of PUF enables patients to securely send and share physiological sensor data from various wearable and implantable medical devices embedded with PUF. Finally, healthcare system entities like physicians, hospital admin networks, and remote monitoring systems can securely establish communication with patients using MAM and retrieve the patient's BAN PUF keys from the blockchain securely. Our experimental analysis shows that the proposed approach successfully integrates three security primitives, PUF, blockchain, and Tangle, providing decentralized access control and security in H-CPS with minimal energy requirements, data storage, and response time.

N2  - Telemedicine enables the remote provision of medical care through information and communication technologies, facilitating data transmission, patient participation, promotion of heart-healthy habits, diagnosis, early detection of acute decompensation, and monitoring and follow-up of cardiovascular diseases. Wearable devices have multiple clinical applications, ranging from arrhythmia detection to remote monitoring of chronic diseases and risk factors. Integrating these technologies safely and effectively into routine clinical practice will require a multidisciplinary approach. Technological advances and data management will increase telemonitoring strategies, which will allow greater accessibility and equity, as well as more efficient and accurate patient care. However, there are still unresolved issues, such as identifying the most appropriate technological infrastructure, integrating these data into medical records, and addressing the digital divide, which can hamper patients’ adoption of remote care. This article provides an updated overview of digital tools for a more comprehensive approach to atrial fibrillation, heart failure, risk factors, and treatment adherence.

N2  - Objective: In this study, we aimed to identify the reasons for and perceived challenges associated with the use of digital health technologies (DHT) in cardiology. Method: We distributed an online survey to Turkish Society of Cardiology member cardiologists (n = 2789) between January 10 and March 3, 2022. Results: A total of 308 subjects responded (27.6% females, 62.0% aged 30-44 years). Of these, 42.5% worked at university hospitals, and 44.8% at state hospitals. Smart devices were used by 44.2% (136/308) for personal health monitoring. Additionally, 40.3% (117/290) used social media to provide medical information to patients, while 64.6% (193/299) did so for communication with other physicians. The self-reported recommendation frequencies of wearables, cardiac implantable electronic device telemonitorization, mobile health applications, and teleconsultation/televisit technologies were lower than the proportion of respondents who found DHT beneficial for both patients and physicians. The most frequently mentioned barriers for physicians were increased work burden and responsibilities (78.8%, 193/245), lack of financial compensation (66.9%, 164/245), and lack of relevant training (66.5%, 163/245). For patients, low technological adaptability (81.6%, 200/245), low health literacy (80.4%, 197/245), and low affordability (79.6%, 195/245) were the most frequently mentioned barriers. Additionally, the cost of technologies (69.4%, 170/245), concerns regarding data privacy and security (57.6%, 141/245), and data storage challenges (48.2%, 118/245) were the most significant technical impediments. Conclusion: The findings suggest that although the majority of physicians believe DHT to be beneficial for both themselves and their patients, the frequency of recommendations to patients remains low. A large-scale joint effort is required to address these issues and facilitate the integration of DHT into clinical practice.

N2  - Introduction: Common, consumer-grade biosensors mounted on fitness trackers and smartwatches can measure an array of biometrics that have potential utility in post-discharge medical monitoring, especially in remote/rural communities. The feasibility characteristics for wrist-worn biosensors are poorly described for post-COVID conditions and rural populations. Methods: We prospectively recruited patients in rural communities who were enrolled in an at-home rehabilitation program for post-COVID conditions. They were asked to wear a FitBit Charge 2 device and biosensor parameters were analyzed (e.g. heart rate, sleep, and activity). Electronic patient reported outcome measures (E-PROMS) for mental (bi-weekly) and physical (daily) symptoms were collected using SMS text or email (per patient preference). Exit surveys and interviews evaluated the patient experience. Results: Ten patients were observed for an average of 58 days and half (N=5) were monitored for 8 weeks or more. Five patients (50%) had been hospitalized with COVID (mean stay = 41 days) and 4 (36%) had required mechanical ventilation. As baseline, patients had moderate to severe levels of anxiety, depression, and stress; fatigue and shortness of breath were the most prevalent physical symptoms. Four patients (40%) already owned a smartwatch. In total, 575 patient days of patient monitoring occurred across 10 patients. Biosensor data was usable for 91.3% of study hours and surveys were completed 82.1% and 78.7% of the time for physical and mental symptoms, respectively. Positive correlations were observed between stress and resting heart rate (r=0.360, p<0.01), stress and daily steps (r=0.335, p<0.01), and anxiety and daily steps (r=0.289, p<0.01). There was a trend toward negative correlation between sleep time and physical symptom burden (r=-0.211, p=0.05). Patients reported an overall positive experience and identified the potential for wearable devices to improve medical safety and access to care. Concerns around data privacy/security were infrequent. Conclusions: We report excellent feasibility characteristics for wrist-worn biosensors and e-PROMS as a possible substrate for multi-modal disease tracking in post-COVID conditions. Adapting consumer-grade wearables for medical use and scalable remote patient monitoring holds great potential.

N2  - Objectives: Remote patient monitoring (RPM) holds significant promise in Parkinson’s disease (PD) management. However, our understanding of the preferences of PD patients for RPM programs remains limited. This study aimed to bridge this gap by eliciting and examining PD patients' preferences for RPM through interviews and a discrete choice experiment (DCE). Methods: A mixed-methods approach was employed to elicit PD patients’ preferences in Finland and Italy. Initially, seven individual semi-structured interviews and five focus groups were conducted, comprising a total of 27 patients. Discussions revolved around three topics: disease detection, current monitoring process, and perceptions about RPM. Building on the insights gained from interviews and focus groups, a 12 choice tasks DCE survey was constructed. The survey also included questions pertaining to patient demographics, prior experience with wearables, and digital literacy. Preferences were estimated using a conditional logit model. Results: Patient concerns regarding data privacy, stigmatization, costs, and device intrusiveness emerged during the discussions. However, potential benefits of symptom control and disease progression management appeared to outweigh most technology-related inconveniences. A DCE was built incorporating five key attributes: effectiveness, monitoring intensity, time commitment for online questionnaires, video recording at home, and out-of-pocket costs for devices purchasing. Initial results (n=7) revealed a preference among participants for more effective RPM interventions (β = 1.15, P=.193) without video recordings (β = 0.90, P=.011). Notably, costs emerged as a significant factor in the preliminary analysis (β = -2.12, P =.002), despite its lesser emphasis in the qualitative analysis. Conclusions: Qualitative findings revealed that patients expressed willingness to embrace RPM if it proves to be effective for symptom and disease progression management. However, initial DCE results indicate that while effectiveness and privacy remain important, the significance of costs is higher than anticipated. These findings are preliminary and require validation through a larger sample size in the ongoing study.

N2  - Telemedicine enables the remote provision of medical care through information and communication technologies, facilitating data transmission, patient participation, promotion of heart-healthy habits, diagnosis, early detection of acute decompensation, and monitoring and follow-up of cardiovascular diseases. Wearable devices have multiple clinical applications, ranging from arrhythmia detection to remote monitoring of chronic diseases and risk factors. Integrating these technologies safely and effectively into routine clinical practice will require a multidisciplinary approach. Technological advances and data management will increase telemonitoring strategies, which will allow greater accessibility and equity, as well as more efficient and accurate patient care. However, there are still unresolved issues, such as identifying the most appropriate technological infrastructure, integrating these data into medical records, and addressing the digital divide, which can hamper patients' adoption of remote care. This article provides an updated overview of digital tools for a more comprehensive approach to atrial fibrillation, heart failure, risk factors, and treatment adherence.

N2  - Long-term remote patients monitoring implies minimal discomfort and reliability throughout the study period. These requirements are fulfilled by portable (wearable) patient devices, with low consumption, which transmit data wirelessly, at a short distance, to a mobile communication device (GSM) and through it, to a remote end recipient - doctor, medical center or a hospital server. The data transfer technology requires the monitored person to perform a sequence of actions, such as: selecting the appropriate application on the mobile phone, establishing a connection between the patient module and the phone, recording the data in the phone's memory, starting the data transfer from the phone to the final receiver. Practice shows that often this sequence of activities is difficult for elderly people and especially for visually impaired people, which as a result compromises the remote monitoring process. In this paper are presented an approach and conceptual implementation of a system for remote monitoring of cardiac activity, using the most popular way of remote connectivity - voice (sound) communication. In addition to the ease of use, this type of communication does not require special data protection, due to the lack of RF interfaces for short-distance data transmission. The presented results of laboratory studies, as well as conducted tests under medical supervision of patients in a cardiology clinic, confirm the workability of the proposed approach for remote monitoring of patients by audio conversion of the ECG signal.

N2  - Importance: Just-in-time interventions (JITIs) are a type of digital therapeutic intervention that combines remote monitoring tools and algorithms to personalize the delivery of specific interventions at the right time. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory approval documents are often the only available source of information on the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions based on these devices. Objective: To systematically review the publicly available information from the FDA on all recently approved medical devices used in JITIs to (1) assess how they operate to deliver JITIs and (2) appraise the evidence supporting their performance and clinical effectiveness. Evidence Review: Two reviewers systematically searched the Premarket Notifications (510(k)), Premarket Approvals, De Novo, and Humanitarian Device Exemption databases from January 2019 to December 2021 for all entries associated with devices that monitored patients' data over time to personalize the delivery of interventions to treat, prevent, or mitigate health conditions or events. They assessed whether the product summaries (1) enabled an understanding of how the device operated to deliver a JITI (eg, the nature, type, and frequency of the monitoring, the nature of the decision algorithm, and the nature and intended receiver of the intervention); (2) informed about the performance and effectiveness of the JITI; and (3) included information on data security and ownership. Findings: In total, 38 devices were included in this review. These were mainly intended for cardiac conditions (12 [31.6%]), diabetes (10 [26.3%]), and neurological diseases (4 [10.5%]). Monitoring devices ranged from wearable (18 of 28 [64.4%]; eg, smartwatches) to implanted sensors (6 of 28 [21.4%]; eg, inserted electrocardiographic sensors). Only 10 of 38 product summaries (26.3%) allowed a full understanding of how the device operated to deliver a JITI. Similarly, only 12 of 28 (42.9%), 12 of 36 (33.3%), and 5 of 38 (13.2%) reported the assessment of the performance of the monitoring device, assessment of the decision algorithm, and results of clinical studies assessing the effectiveness of the JITI, respectively. Finally, 14 of 36 product summaries (38.9%) included some information on data security, but none included information on data ownership. Conclusion and Relevance: The results of this systematic review suggest that the information publicly available in the FDA databases on the performance and effectiveness of digital medical devices used in JITIs is heterogeneous..

N2  - Objectives: The role of startups has been growing in healthcare delivery, particularly in telehealth and telemedicine. Yet, little has been published about their role in evolving digital healthcare ecosystem. This study aimed to review the literature on telehealth startups to understand their roles, challenges, business models, and directions for sustainable innovation and commercialization. Methods: Ten databases were screened: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, ACM digital library, EBSCOhost, Embase, Medline, Cochrane review, and PsycINFO. The articles were shortlisted based on pre-determined screening criteria, and qualitative synthesis was performed. The quality of included studies was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Cohen's K was calculated to ensure the reliability of the authors scoring on the quality appraisal test and qualitative synthesis. Results: 26 articles were included in the review. Findings are clubbed under five themes: remote and on-demand healthcare; healthcare data management; digital therapeutics; high-tech driven personalized care; and information integration and exchange. Technical infrastructure, regulation, and revenue generation were identified as major challenges for telehealth start-ups. Osterwalder business canvas was the predominantly used model. Value perspectives were recognized for a sustainable telehealth innovation and its commercialization. Conclusion: Telehealth startups are evolving to meet digital healthcare needs and playing a significant role in teleconsultations, telemonitoring, and electronic health record solutions. Recently, their focus has shifted towards smartphone-enabled AI-driven personalized care, including digital therapeutics and wearable device innovation. They have significant technical and operational challenges in innovation and commercialization to optimize their role. The review also provides researchers with a new understanding of telehealth startups’ sustainable innovation and commercialization through the systematic direction of value proposition, creation, and capture.

N2  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is recently seeing significant advances in teledermatology (TD), also thanks to the developments that have taken place during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the last two years, there was an important development of studies that focused on opportunities, perspectives, and problems in this field. The topic is very important because the telemedicine and AI applied to dermatology have the opportunity to improve both the quality of healthcare for citizens and the workflow of healthcare professionals. This study conducted an overview on the opportunities, the perspectives, and the problems related to the integration of TD with AI. The methodology of this review, following a standardized checklist, was based on: (I) a search of PubMed and Scopus and (II) an eligibility assessment, using parameters with five levels of score. The outcome highlighted that applications of this integration have been identified in various skin pathologies and in quality control, both in eHealth and mHealth. Many of these applications are based on Apps used by citizens in mHealth for self-care with new opportunities but also open questions. A generalized enthusiasm has been registered regarding the opportunities and general perspectives on improving the quality of care, optimizing the healthcare processes, minimizing costs, reducing the stress in the healthcare facilities, and in making citizens, now at the center, more satisfied. However, critical issues have emerged related to: (a) the need to improve the process of diffusion of the Apps in the hands of citizens, with better design, validation, standardization, and cybersecurity; (b) the need for better attention paid to medico-legal and ethical issues; and (c) the need for the stabilization of international and national regulations. Targeted agreement initiatives, such as position statements, guidelines, and/or consensus initiatives, are needed to ensure a better result for all, along with the design of both specific plans and shared workflows.

N2  - Background and Aim Statement: Smartwatches are increasingly accurate at detecting vital signs, are inexpensive and easy to operate, and hold promise as tools for remote patient monitoring (RPM). The COVID pandemic has highlighted the potential safety benefits of post-discharge RPM in the ED, especially in remote/rural settings. This study aimed to determine the feasibility characteristics of smartwatches in health status tracking for post-COVID patients. Measures and Design: This prospective feasibility trial enrolled patients rehabilitating at home from acute COVID in remote/rural Alberta. Patients were asked to wear a Fitbit Charge 2 device continuously and device metrics were extracted for analysis (e.g. heart rate, sleep, and activity). Electronic patient reported outcome measures (e-PROMS) for mental (bi-weekly) and physical (daily) health were collected via SMS text and email. Exit surveys and semistructured interviews evaluated the patient experience. The primary outcome was proportion of time (study-hours) with usable heart rate data. Secondary measures included completion rate for e-PROMs, patient satisfaction, patient-perceived clinical utility and mental health impacts. Evaluation/results: Of 17 eligible patients, 11 agreed to participate. The mean age was 52 yrs and 73% were female. Five patients (45%) were hospitalized (avg. stay 41 days) and 4 required mechanical ventilation; 6 already owned a smartwatch. The most prominent physical symptoms were fatigue, muscle weakness, headache, and dyspnea. On average, patients had moderate to severe anxiety (GAD 7 = 15.8), depression (PHQ-9 = 19.9), and stress (PSS = 26.6). A total of 21,040 patient-hours were monitored, averaging 1913 hrs per patient (SD = 1396). Heart rate data was usable for 83% of studyhours. Surveys were completed 83% and 72% of the time for mental and physical health, respectively. Survey scores were favorable for usability/acceptability (3.9/7), perceived clinical utility (3.5/7) and mental health impacts (3.8/7). Interviews revealed overall positive patient experience with varying concerns about data privacy/security. Discussion/impact: Smartwatches are feasible tools for RPM, especially given their usability, affordability, and patient acceptance. We will present preliminary estimates for longitudinal associations between smartwatch parameters and e-PROMS. Future work will aim to develop tools for predicting and preventing ED visits/revisits with continuously collected smartwatch data and machine learning.

N2  - Background: Telehealth can improve the treatment of chronic disorders, such as epilepsy. Telehealth prevalence and use increased during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, familiarity with and use of telehealth and health-related mobile applications (apps) by persons with epilepsy remain unknown. Methods: We investigated telehealth use, demographics, and clinical variables within the multicenter Epi2020 cross-sectional study. Between October and December 2020, adults with epilepsy completed a validated questionnaire, including individual questions regarding knowledge and use of apps and telehealth. Results: Of 476 included individuals (58.2% women; mean age 40.2 ± 15.4 years), 41.6% reported using health-related apps. Health apps were used more frequently (pedometer 32.1%, exercise app 17.6%) than medical apps (health insurance 15.1%, menstrual apps 12.2%) or apps designed for epilepsy (medication reminders 10.3%, seizure calendars 4.6%). Few used seizure detectors (i.e., apps as medical devices 1.9%) or mobile health devices (fitness bracelet 11.3%). A majority (60.9%) had heard the term telehealth, 78.6% of whom had a positive view. However, only 28.6% had a concrete idea of telehealth, and only 16.6% reported personal experience with telehealth. A majority (55%) would attend a teleconsultation follow-up, and 41.2% would in a medical emergency. Data privacy and availability were considered equally important by 50.8%, 21.8% considered data privacy more important, and 20.2% considered data availability more important. Current health-related app use was independently associated with younger age (p = 0.003), higher education (p < 0.001), and subjective COVID-19-related challenges (p = 0.002). Persistent seizure occurrence (vs. seizure freedom ≥12 months) did not affect willingness to use teleconsultations on multivariable logistic regression analysis. Conclusions: Despite positive telehealth views, few persons with epilepsy in Germany are familiar with specific apps or services. Socioeconomic factors influence telehealth use more than baseline epilepsy characteristics. Telehealth education and services should target socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals to reduce the digital care gap.

N2  - Widespread proliferation of interconnected healthcare equipment, accompanying software, operating systems, and networks in the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) raises the risk of security compromise as the bulk of IoMT devices are not built to withstand internet attacks. In this work, we have developed a cyber-attack and anomaly detection model based on recursive feature elimination (RFE) and multilayer perceptron (MLP). The RFE approach selected optimal features using logistic regression (LR) and extreme gradient boosting regression (XGBRegressor) kernel functions. MLP parameters were adjusted by using a hyperparameter optimization and 10-fold cross-validation approach was performed for performance evaluations. The developed model was performed on various IoMT cybersecurity datasets, and attained the best accuracy rates of 99.99%, 99.94%, 98.12%, and 96.2%, using Edith Cowan University- Internet of Health Things (ECU-IoHT), Intensive Care Unit (ICU Dataset), Telemetry data, Operating systems’ data, and Network data from the testbed IoT/IIoT network (TON-IoT), and Washington University in St. Louis enhanced healthcare monitoring system (WUSTL-EHMS) datasets, respectively. The proposed method has the ability to counter cyber attacks in healthcare applications.

N2  - In modern healthcare systems, medical devices are playing a major role which involves personalized medical devices which improve the patient's lifestyle as they can be remotely monitored and their data are transmissible. Due to these data transmissions, the number of connections to the existing computer networks is increased. Being interoperable and interconnected these personalized medical devices provide great benefits like improved sensing capabilities and actuating capabilities. But the problem with high connectivity computer networks is that it exposes medical device to high cybersecurity vulnerabilities. The main targets are the pacemakers and institutions like hospitals and clinics. Hackers can easily hack medical devices and change prescriptions. So a cybersecurity breach can leak a patient's sensitive and confidential data and risk the patient's life. To prevent these multifaceted problems from happening these problems must be viewed from a systematic perspective and requires governance, technical controls, regulation, and standards.

N2  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, the patient care delivery paradigm rapidly shifted to remote technological solutions. Rising rates of life expectancy of older people, and deaths due to chronic diseases (CDs) such as cancer, diabetes and respiratory disease pose many challenges to healthcare. While the feasibility of Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) with a Smart Healthcare Monitoring (SHM) framework was somewhat questionable before the COVID-19 pandemic, it is now a proven commodity and is on its way to becoming ubiquitous. More health organizations are adopting RPM to enable CD management in the absence of individual monitoring. The current studies on SHM have reviewed the applications of IoT and/or Machine Learning (ML) in the domain, their architecture, security, privacy and other network related issues. However, no study has analyzed the AI and ubiquitous computing advances in SHM frameworks. The objective of this research is to identify and map key technical concepts in the SHM framework. In this context an interesting and meaningful classification of the research articles surveyed for this work is presented. The comprehensive and systematic review is based on the “Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis” (PRISMA) approach. A total of 2540 papers were screened from leading research archives from 2016 to March 2021, and finally, 50 articles were selected for review. The major advantages, developments, distinctive architectural structure, components, technical challenges and possibilities in SHM are briefly discussed. A review of various recent cloud and fog computing based architectures, major ML implementation challenges, prospects and future trends is also presented. The survey primarily encourages the data driven predictive analytics aspects of healthcare and the development of ML models for health empowerment.

N2  - Modernizing inhaled medications through digital technology can help address persistent problems of non-adherence and poor inhaler technique in patients with obstructive lung diseases. With a growing body of supportive clinical studies, advances in digital inhaler sensors and platforms, greater support from payers and healthcare organizations, significant growth with these technologies is expected. While all digital (smart) inhalers record adherence, these are distinguished by their compatibility with commercial inhalers, capabilities to guide inhaler technique, use of patient-reported outcomes, and user-friendliness for both the healthcare professional (HCP) and patient. Due to the complexity and novelty of employing digital inhalers, collaboration with multiple entities within health systems is necessary and a well-planned integration is needed. For HCPs and patients, cybersecurity and privacy are critical, it will require review by each healthcare organization. In the US, some payers reimburse for remote monitoring using digital inhalers, but reimbursement is currently unavailable in other countries. There are several models for remote patient care, as employing an active, ongoing digital interface between the HCP and patient or they may choose to only review data at clinical encounters. Personalization of therapies and feedback are key to success. While digital inhaler malfunction uncommonly occurs, patient attrition over a year is significant. Some patients will be challenged to use digital platforms or have the necessary technology. Additional research is needed to address cost-effectiveness, in vivo accuracy of inspiratory measurement capable devices, ability to teach inhaler technique, their application for monitoring lung function, and lastly real-world adoption and implementation in routine clinical practice.

N2  - Heart rate at rest and exercise may predict cardiovascular risk. Heart rate variability is a measure of variation in time between each heartbeat, representing the balance between the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system and may predict adverse cardiovascular events. With advances in technology and increasing commercial interest, the scope of remote monitoring health systems has expanded. In this review, we discuss the concepts behind cardiac signal generation and recording, wearable devices, pros and cons focusing on accuracy, ease of application of commercial and medical grade diagnostic devices, which showed promising results in terms of reliability and value. Incorporation of artificial intelligence and cloud based remote monitoring have been evolving to facilitate timely data processing, improve patient convenience and ensure data security.

N2  - Introduction: To capture the patient’s attitude toward remote monitoring of motor neuron disease (MND) in care and clinical trials, and their concerns and preferences regarding the use of digital technology. Methods: We performed an international multi-centre survey study in three MND clinics in The Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Australia. The survey was co-developed by investigators and patients with MND, and sent to patients by e-mail or postal-mail. The main topics included: patients’ attitude towards remote care, participating in decentralized clinical trials, and preferences for and concerns with digital technology use. Results: In total, 332 patients with MND participated. A majority of patients indicated they would be happy to self-monitor their health from home (69%), be remotely monitored by a multidisciplinary care team (75%), and would be willing to participate in clinical trials from home (65%). Patients considered respiratory function and muscle strength most valuable for home-monitoring. The majority of patients considered the use of at least three devices/apps (75%) once a week (61%) to be acceptable for home-monitoring. Fifteen percent of patients indicated they would not wish to perform home-measurements; reporting concerns about the burden and distress of home-monitoring, privacy and data security. Conclusion: Most patients with MND exhibited a positive attitude toward the use of digital technology in both care and clinical trial settings. A subgroup of patients reported concerns with home-monitoring, which should be addressed in order to improve widespread adoption of remote digital technology in clinical MND care.

N2  - Fragmentation of healthcare systems through limited cross-speciality communication and intermittent, intervention-based care, without insight into follow-up and compliance, results in poor patient experiences and potentially contributes to suboptimal outcomes. Data-driven tools and novel technologies have the capability to address these shortcomings, but insights from all stakeholders in the care continuum remain lacking. A structured online questionnaire was given to respondents (n = 1432) in nine global geographies to investigate attitudes to the use of data and novel technologies in the management of vascular disease. Patients with coronary or peripheral artery disease (n = 961), physicians responsible for their care (n = 345), and administrators/healthcare leaders with responsibility for commissioning/procuring cardiovascular services (n = 126) were included. Narrative themes arising from the survey included patients’ desire for more personalized healthcare, shared decision-making, and improved communication. Patients, administrators, and physicians perceived and experienced deficiencies in continuity of care, and all acknowledged the potential for data-driven techniques and novel technologies to address some of these shortcomings. Further, physicians and administrators saw the ‘upstream’ segment of the care journey—before diagnosis, at point of diagnosis, and when determining treatment—as key to enabling tangible improvements in patient experience and outcomes. Finally, despite acceptance that data sharing is critical to the success of such interventions, there remains persistent issues related to trust and transparency. The current fragmented care continuum could be improved and streamlined through the adoption of advanced data analytics and novel technologies, including diagnostic and monitoring techniques. Such an approach could enable the refocusing of healthcare from intermittent contacts and intervention-only focus to a more holistic patient view.

N2  - Background: The use of remote digital technologies in the homes of people with motor neuron disease (MND) has the potential to reduce the burden, and improve the accessibility and personalization of care and clinical trials by enabling tailored collection of disease-related outcomes from home. To date, there is limited information available regarding patient preferences for remote digital technology use. Objectives: To capture the patient's attitude toward remote monitoring of MND in care and clinical trials, and their concerns and preferences regarding the use of digital technology. Methods: We performed an international multi-center survey study in three MND clinics in The Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Australia. The survey was co-developed by investigators and patients with MND, and sent to patients by e-mail or postal-mail. The main topics included: patients' attitude toward remote care, participating in decentralized clinical trials, and preferences for and concerns with digital technology use. Results: In total, 332 patients with MND participated. A majority of patients indicated they would be happy to selfmonitor their health from home (69%), be remotely monitored by a multidisciplinary care team (75%), and would be willing to participate in clinical trials from home (65%). Patients considered respiratory function and muscle strength most valuable for home-monitoring. The majority of patients considered the use of at least three devices/apps (75%) once a week (61%) to be acceptable for home-monitoring. Fifteen percent of patients indicated they would not wish to perform home-measurements; they reported concerns about the burden and distress of home-monitoring, privacy and data security. Conclusion: Most patients with MND exhibited a positive attitude toward the use of digital technology in both care and clinical trial settings. A subgroup of patients reported concerns with home-monitoring, which should be addressed in order to improve widespread adoption of remote digital technology in clinical MND care.

N2  - Background Technology can play a key role in supporting older adults to live independently at home. A User Needs and Requirements study including co-design workshops and an online survey was conducted to inform the development of a technological solution aimed at supporting older adults to remain living independently at home. The online survey component is reported here. Methods Eligibility criteria included that respondents were older adults living at home or caregiving stakeholders providing care to older adults at home e.g. family caregivers or health/social care professionals. Recruitment took place throughout Ireland through civil society organisations and age friendly networks in local councils. Quantitative and qualitative data were gathered from June to July 2020. Descriptive statistics were applied to quantitative data and inductive thematic analysis was performed on free text responses. Results In total, 380 respondents completed the survey (n= 235 older adults, n=77 family caregivers, n=47 healthcare professionals and n=21 home support workers). Older adults identified key issues where technology might support them to live independently, these included, home security (33% n=77), falls (30% n=69), reduced mobility (23% n=55) and loneliness (23% n=54). Thematic analysis highlighted key areas where technology could assist stakeholders in providing care for older adults living independently, these included, remote monitoring of family members (family caregivers), communication with clients (healthcare professionals) and falls (home support workers). Older adults reported that data privacy and the cost of technology were key concerns. All groups reported a high level of willingness to use technology such as ambient sensors, wearable devices and voice activated assistants to support independent living. Conclusion Results of this survey provide insights into user needs and requirements in combination with results from co-design workshops to inform the design, development and trial of a technology system to support independent living at home.

N2  - The recent pandemic with SARS-CoV-2 raises questions worldwide regarding telemedicine for housebound patients, including those with cardiovascular conditions. The need for further investigation, monitoring and therapeutic management are advancing practical issues which had not been identified for consideration prior to the pandemic. Using the marketing assessment, we identified the needs of the patients and evaluated the future steps necessary in the short term to meet them. The research found progress made via telemedicine in monitoring and conducting minor decisions (like up-titrating the doses of different medication regimens) in patients with several cardiovascular diseases (heart failure, atrial fibrillation, high blood pressure), as there is a worldwide trend to develop new telemonitoring biosensors and devices based on implantable delivered transcatheter. The worldwide telemedicine trend encourages a switch from small and hesitating steps to a more consistent assessment of the patients, based on high technology and Interventional Cardiology. Cardiovascular telemedicine, although made a sustainable effort in managing patients' health, has many obstacles to overcome before meeting all their needs. Data security, confidentiality and reimbursement are the top priorities in developing remote Cardiology. The regulatory institutions need to play an integrative role in leading the way for defining the framework of future telemedicine activities. The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak with all its tragedy served to reinforce the message that telemedicine services can be life-saving for cardiovascular patients. Once the Covid-19 era will fade away, telemedicine is likely to remain a complementary service of standard care. There is still room to improve the remote identification and investigation of heart disease, provide an accurate diagnosis and therapeutic regimen, and update regulations and guidelines to the new realities of technological progress in the field.

N2  - Purpose of review Telemedicine has quickly become an essential part of modern healthcare, particularly in the management of chronic conditions like inflammatory bowel disease. The purpose of this review is to describe the current use of telehealth, mobile applications and wearable devices in inflammatory bowel disease and potential future applications. Recent findings Telemedicine was increasingly used during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic. Virtual consultations allowed clinical care to continue despite pandemic-related restrictions without compromising the quality of care for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It also benefits patients who would not have access to care due to financial or geographical barriers. Mobile applications allow patients with IBD to record disease activity among other metrics, allowing for earlier healthcare provider intervention. Wearable devices are increasingly being explored to monitor physiological indicators of disease activity and flare. Summary Telehealth and remote patient monitoring has been successfully integrated into the care of IBD patients. The advantages of these modalities include better access to specialist care and remote noninvasive disease monitoring. Careful consideration must be given to patient privacy, data protection and equitable access. These modalities have enormous potential to improve patient care through accurate consistent data collection and even the prediction of disease activity.

N2  - Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has advanced market awareness of the benefits of remote-controlled ventilators to reduce the exposure of healthcare workers to patients with COVID-19, enable more rapid and frequent ventilator setting adjustment, and preserve limited personal protective equipment. The US FDA permitted manufacturers to add remote monitoring and control capabilities to ventilators and infusion pumps through immediate in effect guidance [1,2]. When integrated with tele-critical care systems, remote control of medical devices allows distant clinical experts to collaborate with local clinicians to “virtually” manage the therapy of patients at hotspots. Core remote control capabilities can also be used by software applications to implement medical device control algorithms for Software as a Medical Device (SaMD). The US Army /TATRC launched the National Tele-Critical Care Network (NETCCN) to rapidly develop and deploy a platform to support COVID-19 disaster response [3]. We are investigating technical solutions, communication protocols, and safety assurance measures for integrating remote control of medical devices to the NETCCN systems. Methods: We developed an architecture and a prototype system (Figure 1) to investigate safety, security, and interoperability requirements for integration of remote control of medical devices with tele-critical care systems. The prototype system is based on OpenICE [4], an open-source interoperability platform developed by our program to transmit data and control medical devices at the patient's bedside. Customized interfaces (hardware and software) translate device proprietary protocols to ISO/IEEE 11073-10101 terminology over DDS middleware. Remote control applications of devices connected to OpenICE are implemented as either stand-alone OpenICE apps, which can be deployed inside or immediately outside the patient's room, or as web-based apps, which can be launched from any location to communicate with the OpenICE system. We refer to the former as “nearpatient remote control”, which may be at the bedside or co-located outside the room, and the latter as “far remote” control where the operator does not have physical access to the patient or medical equipment. Our prototype system uses the RTI Web Integration Service [5] to enable web-based control applications to communicate with the connected devices. Results: The generic architecture in Figure 1 is device agnostic: it can be used with critical care ventilators, IV infusion pumps, and other devices, provided that the device interfaces support remote control. As a proof of concept, we applied this architecture to a Q Core Sapphire IV infusion pump using a non-clinical control interface, and confirmed that the infusion rate could be adjusted by both near-patient and far remote (web) control applications with generally acceptable delays (3∼8 seconds from remote control action until the pump executes the change). This prototype system allows the exploration and validation of risks associated with medical device remote control in the tele-critical care context. An example of a risk identified in our study relates contention between near and far “loci of control”. Unexpected device behavior can occur if there is no mechanism to 1) explicitly prioritize loci of control that may occur simultaneously (e.g., always prioritize local control over far control to enable the local provider to regain control or prevent remote control); and 2) clearly indicate where the locus of control resides. Other risks may arise due to issues related to cybersecurity, network QoS, permission for remote control, and usability (e.g., use errors associated with far remote control due to the lack of a real-time view of the patient). We are collaborating with the AAMI InterOperability Working Group (IOWG) to share the experience and lessons learned in this effort to develop a safety standard for medical device remote control, and with other performers in the NETCCN portfolio.

N2  - Background and Aims: The goal of increased telemedicine as part of diabetes care has been intensified and accelerated as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Made possible since the advent of cloud-connected technologies for diabetes management, such as continuous glucose monitoring systems, the development of telemedicine as part of the standard of care for people with diabetes still faces significant challenges in Europe. Methods: A group of multidisciplinary experts from across Europe participated in an in-depth needs assessment and review of the benefits and challenges to wider access and implementation of telemedicine and telemonitoring in the post-pandemic future. Results: Challenges include: 1) a fragmented approach to healthcare technology assessment and reimbursement; 2) lack of eHealth education and literacy, amongst healthcare professionals and patients; 3) lack of data integration with electronic health records; 4) patient consent, privacy and data protection. To meet these challenges, the following actions were identified: 1) investment in telemedicine and technology that allows remote monitoring; 2) bridge health inequities; 3) protect patient data and privacy; 4) incentivize broad adoption by patients, providers and health systems; 5) ensure a true measure of the value these technologies bring. Conclusions: There is a strong consensus among experts on the challenges that must be overcome to secure access to telemonitoring and telemedicine for the diabetes community. There is a significant need for action across European health policymakers, to move forward in establishing digital competencies and developing sustainable solutions that support wider implementation of digital technologies and telemedicine in diabetes care.

N2  - Adolescents and young adults (AYAs; age 15-39 years) with cancer are under-represented in cancer clinical trials because of patient, provider, and institutional barriers. Health care technology is increasingly available to and highly used among AYAs and has the potential to improve cancer care delivery. The COVID-19 pandemic forced institutions to rapidly adopt novel approaches for enrollment and monitoring of patients on cancer clinical trials, many of which have the potential for improving AYA trial participation overall. This consensus statement from the Children's Oncology Group AYA Oncology Discipline Committee reviews opportunities to use technology to optimize AYA trial enrollment and study conduct, as well as considerations for widespread implementation of these practices. The use of remote patient eligibility screening, electronic informed consent, virtual tumor boards, remote study visits, and remote patient monitoring are recommended to increase AYA access to trials and decrease the burden of participation. Widespread adoption of these strategies will require new policies focusing on reimbursement for telehealth, license portability, facile communication between electronic health record systems and advanced safeguards to maintain patient privacy and security. Studies are needed to determine optimal approaches to further incorporate technology at every stage of the clinical trial process, from enrollment through study completion.

N2  - Background: Cancer is likely to remain the most prevalent noncommunicable disease in high-income countries with an older population. Interestingly, no review of attitudes toward telemedicine among older adults has been performed. This is likely to be the group most affected by both cancer and the increasing use of technology in health care. Objective: We aimed to map research on the acceptance of telemedicine among older adults who are cancer patients. Methods: We conducted a scoping review. PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were systematically searched from inception to September 2020. Articles were included if the study population had a mean or median age ≥65 years, with cancer diagnoses and if the study assessed patients’ acceptance of a telemedicine intervention. Quantitative, qualitative, and mixed method studies were included. Results: Out of a total of 887 articles that were identified, 19 were included in the review. Interventions were delivered via telephone, videoconference, web portal, mobile app, wearable technology, and text messaging and included teleconsultation, monitoring and follow-up, psychosocial support and nursing care, and prompts. The most often cited facilitating factor was convenience. Other facilitators included an increase in telemedicine care accessibility, previous positive experiences of telemedicine, appropriate technical knowledge and support, decreased cost, physician recommendations, and privacy conferred by the telemedicine intervention. Barriers include a preference for conventional care along with negative perceptions of telemedicine, concerns about technical difficulties, and confidentiality concerns in the adoption of telemedicine. Conclusions: None of the studies explored the ability of tailored interventions to address facilitators and barriers of the acceptance of telemedicine in order to increase its adoption by older adults. Facilitators and barriers will likely differ across different cultural contexts and by type of telemedicine; however, this is a gap in current knowledge. In-depth studies are necessary to determine if interventions could potentially address the barriers identified in this review, to increase acceptability.

N2  - Digital health tools encompass a wide range of technologies that have been used in healthcare services including mobile applications, health information technology, smart wearable devices, remote monitoring and treatment, and health platforms. These tools walk a fine line between lifestyle consumer products and medical devices. Sleep applications can be used by consumers as a fun gadget to track sleep, but it may also be used as a medical tool to collect information concerning serious sleep disorders. The fast proliferation of these tools has put pressure on concerned stakeholders to make sense of this group of technologies. Various questions have been raised within this realm: What counts as medical as opposed to a lifestyle device? Which devices require regulation and under what standards? Which devices are allowed to be used in the medical context? And which are not? And under what conditions? Social scientists have highlighted the complexity of digital health tools that (include both medical and lifestyle characteristics and the difficulties accompanied with classifying these tools for regulatory purposes. In an attempt to do so, several regulatory bodies including the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have revised their existing standards to accommodate the regulation of digital health tools. As such, the FDA published a guidance document on Mobile Medical Applications; this led to various concerns questioning the boundaries between lifestyle and medical digital technologies that were defined by the FDA guidelines, which left a significant number of technologies that were considered to be low-risk, completely out of the FDA oversight and with no required compliance/quality control/effectiveness checks. This prompted many companies to develop hundreds of products that belong to the low-risk category, granting them the ability to ignore FDA regulations. Consequently, there remains considerable concern regarding the quality and safety of these digital health technologies that are being used within the medical context. Clear and well-defined regulation processes are needed to control the development and design of these tools, especially that many lack scientific evidence and data privacy. The framework ought to include a risk-based approach to classify devices for regulation in a way to ensure the safety and effectiveness of all digital health tools throughout their life cycle, even those classified as low-risk. The framework and regulatory process also need to take into consideration the rapid change in digital product development, as processes that extend for a long period of time may become obsolete in supporting decisions about these tools. As these digital health tools become more sophisticated, accessible, widespread, and cheaper, the need for classifying and regulating the sector becomes important, especially with the rapid evolution of these technologies.

N2  - While COVID-19 is still ongoing and associated with more than 5 million deaths, the scope and speed of advances over the past year in terms of scientific discovery, data dissemination, and technology have been staggering. It is not a matter of “if” but “when” we will face the next pandemic, and how we leverage technology and data management effectively to create flexible ecosystems that facilitate collaboration, equitable care, and innovation will determine its severity and scale. The aim of this review is to address emerging challenges that came to light during the pandemic in health care and innovations that enabled us to adapt and continue to care for patients. The pandemic highlighted the need for seismic shifts in care paradigms and technology with considerations related to the digital divide and health literacy for digital health interventions to reach full potential and improve health outcomes. We discuss advances in telemedicine, remote patient monitoring, and emerging wearable technologies. Despite the promise of digital health, we emphasise the importance of addressing its limitations, including interpretation challenges, accuracy of findings, and artificial intelligence–driven algorithms. We summarise the most recent recommendation of the Virtual Care Task Force to scaling virtual medical services in Canada. Finally, we propose a model for optimal implementation of health digital innovations with 5 tenets including data management, data security, digital biomarkers, useful artificial intelligence, and clinical integration.

N2  - IoT-based healthcare systems are used for remote health monitoring and diagnosis to reduce the cost of health care services. A secure transmission of health data is vital for treatment or monitoring purposes. Also, since the patient's information may be easily tracked by other devices, it must be kept safe against misuse and data alteration while being stored. IoT networks are significantly resource-constrained, with low processor capability, memory, and power, making it challenging to perform the expensive operations required by ciphering algorithms. Therefore, they need a lightweight security approach that requires fewer resources.This paper proposes a hybrid cipher method for secure data transmission from IoT healthcare devices. The encryption method combines three cipher approaches,a modified lightweight Salsa20 that uses 16-words (each word is 32-bit). First, a five-dimension chaotic map is applied to generate32-keys with the 64-bit length for each sensing data (block of bits). Second, a random shifting is used on the generated keys to seem like a dynamic key. Third, the exclusive-or operation is applied between a generated key with sensing data and modified Salsa20 words.Fourth, the DNA computing operation used in the proposed method increases security by applying the addition DNA operation between the result of the previous step with random selection word in Salsa20 state after converting them to DNA form. Finally, a hash function called SHA3-256 isapplied on sensing data that is used for data integrity when transferring data to the server. The total sent data are the hash data result, the output of DNA result after converting back to a decimal number, and two random numbers for shifting key and selecting Salsa20 word, respectively. Experiments and results of the proposed Algorithm based on NIST testing show that the proposed algorithms provide security features for data content, including confidentiality, authentication, and non-repudiation, and are compatible with all types of sensors to send secure data to the final administrator.

N2  - Modern technologies have been integrated into medical systems to assist healthcare systems in the areas of real-time disease analysis, remote monitoring, and real-time drug prescriptions, among other things. These technologies have substantially aided in the storage of patients’ personal information and symptoms, as well as the quality of healthcare personnel’s services. However, the security and privacy of patients have attracted great attention in the healthcare system. Another serious concern in implementing security for patients’ medical information is data privacy over the IoMT-based system. Therefore, a steganography model is proposed in this paper to secure IoMT-based medical data and information. Steganography is utilised to conceal private information, to provide security and privacy of medical information. The paper results show high resistance to data loss, and reveal remarkable protection in terms of privacy and security of IoMT-based system. The performance metrics show a better result concerning PSNR (66.45), RMES (0.98245), and MSE (0.8364) respectively.

N2  - Background: Functional decline in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is typically measured using single-time point subjective rating scales, which rely on direct observation or (caregiver) recall. Remote monitoring technologies (RMTs), such as smartphone applications, wearables, and home-based sensors, can change these periodic subjective assessments to more frequent, or even continuous, objective monitoring. The aim of the RADAR-AD study is to assess the accuracy and validity of RMTs in measuring functional decline in a real-world environment across preclinical-to-moderate stages of AD compared to standard clinical rating scales. Methods: This study includes three tiers. For the main study, we will include participants (n = 220) with preclinical AD, prodromal AD, mild-to-moderate AD, and healthy controls, classified by MMSE and CDR score, from clinical sites equally distributed over 13 European countries. Participants will undergo extensive neuropsychological testing and physical examination. The RMT assessments, performed over an 8-week period, include walk tests, financial management tasks, an augmented reality game, two activity trackers, and two smartphone applications installed on the participants’ phone. In the first sub-study, fixed sensors will be installed in the homes of a representative sub-sample of 40 participants. In the second sub-study, 10 participants will stay in a smart home for 1 week. The primary outcome of this study is the difference in functional domain profiles assessed using RMTs between the four study groups. The four participant groups will be compared for each RMT outcome measure separately. Each RMT outcome will be compared to a standard clinical test which measures the same functional or cognitive domain. Finally, multivariate prediction models will be developed. Data collection and privacy are important aspects of the project, which will be managed using the RADAR-base data platform running on specifically designed biomedical research computing infrastructure. Results: First results are expected to be disseminated in 2022. Conclusion: Our study is well placed to evaluate the clinical utility of RMT assessments. Leveraging modern-day technology may deliver new and improved methods for accurately monitoring functional decline in all stages of AD. It is greatly anticipated that these methods could lead to objective and real-life functional endpoints with increased sensitivity to pharmacological agent signal detection.

N2  - Background: The use of wearable sensor technology to collect patient health data, such as gait and physical activity, offers the potential to transform healthcare research. To maximise the use of wearable devices in practice, it is important that they are usable by, and offer value to, all stakeholders. Although previous research has explored participants’ opinions of devices, to date, limited studies have explored the experiences and opinions of the researchers who use and implement them. Researchers offer a unique insight into wearable devices as they may have access to multiple devices and cohorts, and thus gain a thorough understanding as to how and where this area needs to progress. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the experiences and opinions of researchers from academic, industry and clinical contexts, in the use of wearable devices to measure gait and physical activity. Methods: Twenty professionals with experience using wearable devices in research were recruited from academic, industry and clinical backgrounds. Independent, semi-structured interviews were conducted, audio-recorded and transcribed. Transcribed texts were analysed using inductive thematic analysis. Results: Five themes were identified: (1) The positives and negatives of using wearable devices in research, (2) The routine implementation of wearable devices into research and clinical practice, (3) The importance of compromise in protocols, (4) Securing good quality data, and (5) A paradigm shift. Researchers overwhelmingly supported the use of wearable sensor technology due to the insights that they may provide. Though barriers remain, researchers were pragmatic towards these, believing that there is a paradigm shift happening in this area of research that ultimately requires mistakes and significant volumes of further research to allow it to progress. Conclusions: Multiple barriers to the use of wearable devices in research and clinical practice remain, including data management and clear clinical utility. However, researchers strongly believe that the potential benefit of these devices to support and create new clinical insights for patient care, is greater than any current barrier. Multi-disciplinary research integrating the expertise of both academia, industry and clinicians is a fundamental necessity to further develop wearable devices and protocols that match the varied needs of all stakeholders.

N2  - During the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, different technologies, including telehealth, are maximised to mitigate the risks and consequences of the disease. Telehealth has been widely utilised because of its usability and safety in providing healthcare services during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, a systematic literature review which provides extensive evidence on the impact of COVID-19 through telehealth and which covers multiple directions in a large-scale research remains lacking. This study aims to review telehealth literature comprehensively since the pandemic started. It also aims to map the research landscape into a coherent taxonomy and characterise this emerging field in terms of motivations, open challenges and recommendations. Articles related to telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic were systematically searched in the WOS, IEEE, Science Direct, Springer and Scopus databases. The final set included (n = 86) articles discussing telehealth applications with respect to (i) control (n = 25), (ii) technology (n = 14) and (iii) medical procedure (n = 47). Since the beginning of the pandemic, telehealth has been presented in diverse cases. However, it still warrants further attention. Regardless of category, the articles focused on the challenges which hinder the maximisation of telehealth in such times and how to address them. With the rapid increase in the utilization of telehealth in different specialised hospitals and clinics, a potential framework which reflects the authors’ implications of the future application and opportunities of telehealth has been established. This article improves our understanding and reveals the full potential of telehealth during these difficult times and beyond.

N2  - Background: Using mobile health, vital signs such as heart rate (HR) can be used to assess a patient's recovery process from acute events including acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Objective: We aimed to characterize clinical correlates associated with HR change in the subacute period among patients recovering from AMI. Methods: HR measurements were collected from 91 patients (4447 HR recordings) enrolled in the MiCORE study using the Apple Watch and Corrie smartphone application. Mixed regression models were used to estimate the associations of patient-level characteristics during hospital admission with HR changes over 30 days postdischarge. Results: The mean daily HR at admission was 78.0 beats per minute (bpm) (95% confidence interval 76.1 to 79.8), declining 0.2 bpm/day (-0.3 to -0.1) under a linear model of HR change. History of coronary artery bypass graft, history of depression, or being discharged on anticoagulants was associated with a higher admission HR. Having a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), or hyperlipidemia was associated with a slower decrease in HR over time, but not with HR during admission. Conclusion: While a declining HR was observed in AMI patients over 30 days postdischarge, patients with hypertension, T2DM, or hyperlipidemia showed a slower decrease in HR relative to their counterparts. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using wearables to model the recovery process of patients with AMI and represents a first step in helping pinpoint patients vulnerable to decompensation.

N2  - Introduction: Insertable cardiac monitors (ICMs) provide a minimally invasive method of continuous monitoring for abnormal heart rhythms. While the benefits of ICMs are clear, current algorithm performance can be improved. The objective of this study is to assess the performance of a novel adaptive atrial fibrillation (AF) detection algorithm and separately programmable atrial tachycardia (AT) algorithm. Methods: A dual-stage detect-and-verify AF algorithm and separately programmable AT algorithm were developed. Sensitivity and PPV across a range of settings were determined in silico by comparison with an adjudicated Holter data set (n = 1966 with 229 patient days). Finally, the ability to improve performance through simulated remote programming was assessed. Results: The dual-stage algorithm detected AF in all true AF patients (76/76) resulting in a patient-level sensitivity of 100%. Episode-level sensitivity and PPV ranged from 97.6% to 100% and 79.1% to 98.5%, respectively. Thirty-six false-positive episodes were observed and 32 (88.9%) of these were corrected with programming changes. Decoupling of AF and AT durations improved PPV from a range of 10%–22% to a range of 95%–100%. Conclusions: AF and AT algorithms were designed with novel features including an adaptive morphology assessment for AF detection and separately programmable durations for AT detection. In silico performance yielded improved PPVs while maintaining high sensitivity across a range of settings. Importantly, programming changes that may be made remotely with this system reduced false positives. These algorithms allow clinicians to individualize arrhythmia detection settings thereby improving data management and reducing clinic burden.

N2  - The use of remote monitoring technology for cardiovascular electronic implantable devices has grown significantly in recent decades, yet several key questions remain about its integration into clinical care. We performed semi-structured interviews of patients, clinicians, and device clinic technicians involved in clinical remote monitoring of cardiovascular implantable devices at our institution. Twenty-eight interviews comprised of 15 patients and 13 clinicians were conducted from October 2019 through February 2020. Interview transcripts were analyzed using a mixed inductive and deductive approach. Perspectives among clinicians and patients varied regarding familiarity, educational experiences, and preferences regarding how remote monitoring data are handled. Three key domains emerged including knowledge and understanding, managing alerts, and cost transparency. Within these domains, key findings includedvery limited understanding of how remote monitoring functions and how alerts in particular are handled. These knowledge deficits (both patients and providers) appeared to arise in part from different equipment and platforms among manufacturers, the complexity of the technology, and lack of formalized education in remote monitoring. However, interviewees expressed generally high levels of trust in the technology and care systems supporting remote monitoring. Few respondents described concerns around cybersecurity, but patients in particular did raise concerns about cost transparency and frequent billing. In conclusion, conflicting perceptions around remote monitoring persist and indicate important knowledge gaps despite high trust in the care pathway. This qualitative analysis offers insight into patient and clinician understanding of and attitudes toward remote monitoring, and may guide future efforts to improve education and patient-centeredness of remote monitoring.

N2  - This paper describes a security protocol and proof-of-concept implementation for wearable medical sensor devices that are deployed in hospitals. The sensor device measures the patient’s vital sign parameters and sends them to the hospital server, such that the data can be processed and stored in the EMR (Electronic Medical Record) of the patient. The proposed security protocol is based on symmetric-key cryptography and addresses the challenges of anonymity, unlinkability, mutual authentication and perfect forward secrecy. Moreover, it relies on decentralised authentication, avoiding an authentication server to be the single point of attack. Besides offering strong security features, the proposed protocol and implementation take into account that sensor devices are typically constrained with respect to communication bandwidth and computation power. Therefore, these parameters are evaluated in addition to the security analysis of the presented protocol. Our solution gives stronger security guarantees than related work, while featuring a comparable computation overhead and the lowest communication overhead.

N2  - Secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD), the leading cause of morbidity and mortality, is critical to improving health outcomes and quality of life in our aging population. As mobile health (mHealth) technology gains universal leverage and popularity, it is becoming more user-friendly for older adults and an adjunct to manage CVD risk and improve overall cardiovascular health. With the rapid advances in mHealth technology and increasing technological engagement of older adults, a comprehensive understanding of the current literature and knowledge of gaps and barriers surrounding the impact of mHealth on secondary CVD prevention is essential. After a systematic review of the literature, 26 studies that used mHealth for secondary CVD prevention focusing on lifestyle behavior change and medication adherence in cohorts with a mean age of ≥60 years were identified. Improvements in health behaviors and medication adherence were observed, particularly when there was a short message service (ie, texting) component involved. Although mobile technologies are becoming more mainstream and are starting to blend more seamlessly with standard health care, there are still distinct barriers that limit implementation particularly in older adults, including affordability, usability, privacy, and security issues. Furthermore, studies on the type of mHealth that is the most effective for older adults with longer study duration are essential as the field continues to grow. As our population ages, identifying and implementing effective, widely accepted, cost-effective, and time-efficient mHealth interventions to improve CVD health in a vulnerable demographic group should be a top health priority.

N2  - The current public health crisis has highlighted the need to accelerate healthcare innovation. Despite unwavering levels of cooperation among academia, industry, and policy makers, it can still take years to bring a life-saving product to market. There are some obvious limitations, including lack of blinding or masking and small sample size, which render the results less applicable to the real world. Traditional randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are lengthy, expensive, and have a low success rate. There is a growing acknowledgement that the current process no longer fully meets the growing healthcare needs. Advances in technology coupled with proliferation of telehealth modalities, sensors, wearable and connected devices have paved the way for a new paradigm. Virtual randomized controlled trials (vRCTs) have the potential to drastically shorten the clinical trial cycle while maximizing patient-centricity, compliance, and recruitment. This new approach can inform clinical trials in real time and with a holistic view of a patient’s health. This paper provides an overview of virtual clinical trials, addressing critical issues, including regulatory compliance, data security, privacy, and ownership.

N2  - The increasing popularity of wearable consumer products can play a significant role in the healthcare sector. The recognition of human activities from IoT is an important building block in this context. While the analysis of the generated datastream can have many benefits from a health point of view, it can also lead to privacy threats by exposing highly sensitive information. In this article, we propose a framework that relies on machine learning to efficiently recognise the user activity, useful for personal healthcare monitoring, while limiting the risk of users re-identification from biometric patterns characterizing each individual. To achieve that, we show that features in temporal domain are useful to discriminate user activity while features in frequency domain lead to distinguish the user identity. We then design a novel protection mechanism processing the raw signal on the user's smartphone to select relevant features for activity recognition and normalise features sensitive to re-identification. These unlinkable features are then transferred to the application server. We extensively evaluate our framework with reference datasets: Results show an accurate activity recognition (87%) while limiting the re-identification rate (33%). This represents a slight decrease of utility (9%) against a large privacy improvement (53%) compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

N2  - Policy Points Millions of life-sustaining implantable devices collect and relay massive amounts of digital health data, increasingly by using user-downloaded smartphone applications to facilitate data relay to clinicians via manufacturer servers. Our analysis of health privacy laws indicates that most US patients may have little access to their own digital health data in the United States under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Privacy Rule, whereas the EU General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act grant greater access to device-collected data. Our normative analysis argues for consistently granting patients access to the raw data collected by their implantable devices. Context: Millions of life-sustaining implantable devices collect and relay massive amounts of digital health data, increasingly by using user-downloaded smartphone applications to facilitate data relay to clinicians via manufacturer servers. Whether patients have either legal or normative claims to data collected by these devices, particularly in the raw, granular format beyond that summarized in their medical records, remains incompletely explored. Methods: Using pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) as a clinical model, we outline the clinical ecosystem of data collection, relay, retrieval, and documentation. We consider the legal implications of US and European privacy regulations for patient access to either summary or raw device data. Lastly, we evaluate ethical arguments for or against providing patients access to data beyond the summaries presented in medical records. Findings: Our analysis of applicable health privacy laws indicates that US patients may have little access to their raw data collected and held by device manufacturers in the United States under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Privacy Rule, whereas the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) grants greater access to device-collected data when the processing of personal data falls under the GDPR's territorial scope. The California Consumer Privacy Act, the “little sister” of the GDPR, also grants greater rights to California residents. By contrast, our normative analysis argues for consistently granting patients access to the raw data collected by their implantable devices. Smartphone applications are increasingly involved in the collection, relay, retrieval, and documentation of these data. Therefore, we argue that smartphone user agreements are an emerging but potentially underutilized opportunity for clarifying both legal and ethical claims for device-derived data. Conclusions: Current health privacy legislation incompletely supports patients’ normative claims for access to digital health data.

N2  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is a system of wireless, interrelated, and connected digital devices that can collect, send, and store data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction. The IoT promises many benefits to streamlining and enhancing health care delivery to proactively predict health issues and diagnose, treat, and monitor patients both in and out of the hospital. Worldwide, government leaders and decision makers are implementing policies to deliver health care services using technology and more so in response to the novel COVID-19 pandemic. It is now becoming increasingly important to understand how established and emerging IoT technologies can support health systems to deliver safe and effective care. The aim of this viewpoint paper is to provide an overview of the current IoT technology in health care, outline how IoT devices are improving health service delivery, and outline how IoT technology can affect and disrupt global health care in the next decade. The potential of IoT-based health care is expanded upon to theorize how IoT can improve the accessibility of preventative public health services and transition our current secondary and tertiary health care to be a more proactive, continuous, and coordinated system. Finally, this paper will deal with the potential issues that IoT-based health care generates, barriers to market adoption from health care professionals and patients alike, confidence and acceptability, privacy and security, interoperability, standardization and remuneration, data storage, and control and ownership. Corresponding enablers of IoT in current health care will rely on policy support, cybersecurity-focused guidelines, careful strategic planning, and transparent policies within health care organizations. IoT-based health care has great potential to improve the efficiency of the health system and improve population health.

N2  - Innovative ways of healthcare delivery like m-Health, the practice of medicine by mobile devices and wearable devices are the promising new technique that may lead to improvement in quality of care at lower costs. While fully acknowledging the importance of m-Health development, there are challenges on privacy legislation. We address the legal framework, especially the General Data Protection Regulation, applied to m-Health and its implications for m-Health developments in Europe. We discuss how these rules are applied using a representative example of an m-Health programme with remote monitoring in the Netherlands. We consider informing patients about the data processing and obtaining their explicit consent as main responsibilities of healthcare providers introducing m-Health in their practice.

N2  - Social isolation is likely to be recommended for older adults due to COVID-19, with ongoing reduced clinical contact suggested for this population. This has increased the need for remote memory clinics, we therefore review the literature, current practices and guidelines on organizing such remote memory clinics, focusing on assessment of cognition, function and other relevant measurements, proposing a novel pathway based on three levels of complexity: simple telephone or video-based interviews and testing using available tests (Level 1), digitized and validated methods based on standard pen-and-paper tests and scales (Level 2), and finally fully digitized cognitive batteries and remote measurement technologies (RMTs, Level 3). Pros and cons of these strategies are discussed. Remotely collected data negates the need for frail patients or carers to commute to clinic and offers valuable insights into progression over time, as well as treatment responses to therapeutic interventions, providing a more realistic and contextualized environment for data-collection. Notwithstanding several challenges related to internet access, computer skills, limited evidence base and regulatory and data protection issues, digital biomarkers collected remotely have significant potential for diagnosis and symptom management in older adults and we propose a framework and pathway for how technologies can be implemented to support remote memory clinics. These platforms are also well-placed for administration of digital cognitive training and other interventions. The individual, societal and public/private costs of COVID-19 are high and will continue to rise for some time but the challenges the pandemic has placed on memory services also provides an opportunity to embrace novel approaches. Remote memory clinics’ financial, logistical, clinical and practical benefits have been highlighted by COVID-19, supporting their use to not only be maintained when social distancing legislation is lifted but to be devoted extra resources and attention to fully potentiate this valuable arm of clinical assessment and care.

N2  - Mobile applications provide the healthcare industry with a means of connecting with patients in their own home utilizing their own personal mobile devices such as tablets and phones. This allows therapists to monitor the progress of people under their care from a remote location and all with the added benefit that patients are familiar with their own mobile devices; thereby reducing the time required to train patients with the new technology. There is also the added benefit to the health service that there is no additional cost required to purchase devices for use. The Facial Remote Activity Monitoring Eyewear (FRAME) mobile application and web service framework has been designed to work on the IOS and android platforms, the two most commonly used today. Results: The system utilizes secure cloud based data storage to collect, analyse and store data, this allows for near real time, secure access remotely by therapists to monitor their patients and intervene when required. The underlying framework has been designed to be secure, anonymous and flexible to ensure compliance with the data protection act and the latest General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR); this new standard came into effect in April 2018 and replaces the Data Protection Act in the UK and Europe.

N2  - Purpose of Review: This review discusses how wearable devices—sensors externally applied to the body to measure a physiological signal—can be used in heart failure (HF) care. Recent Findings: Most wearables are marketed to consumers and can measure movement, heart rate, and blood pressure; detect and monitor arrhythmia; and support exercise training and rehabilitation. Wearable devices targeted at healthcare professionals include ECG patch recorders and vests, patches, and textiles with in-built sensors for improved prognostication and the early detection of acute decompensation. Integrating data from wearables into clinical decision-making has been slow due to clinical inertia and concerns regarding data security and validity, lack of evidence of meaningful impact, interoperability, regulatory and reimbursement issues, and legal liability. Summary: Although few studies have assessed how best to integrate wearable technologies into clinical practice, their use is rapidly expanding and may support improved decision-making by patients and healthcare professionals along the whole patient pathway.

N2  - Telediabetes may improve patient access to clinicians who specialize in the management of pediatric diabetes. Due to the diversity of telehealth modes, many different service models for pediatric telediabetes have been developed. This review describes pediatric telediabetes service models identified in the literature, investigates the reported changes in HbA1c of these interventions, and describes enablers and barriers to implementing a telediabetes service. Evaluation of current literature may inform the development and sustainability of telehealth services for pediatric diabetes management. Twenty-nine studies met inclusion criteria and were reviewed. This review has demonstrated that pediatric telediabetes can be delivered by remote monitoring and real-time videoconference modes. Overall, pediatric telediabetes increased interactions between patients and clinicians, improved access to specialized care, and facilitated increased diabetes monitoring. In some contexts, telediabetes also improved short-term glycemic control. Key enablers reported for telediabetes services were integration with existing workflows, dedicated staff, clinician and patient training, appropriate data security, technology with good usability, and the availability of technical support. Barriers included increases in patient responsibilities and clinician workload, and technical issues with equipment and software.

N2  - Digitization of healthcare will be a major innovation driver in the coming decade. Also, enabled by technological advancements and electronics miniaturization, wearable health device (WHD) applications are expected to grow exponentially. This, in turn, may make 4P medicine (predictive, precise, preventive and personalized) a more attainable goal within dialysis patient care. This article discusses different use cases where WHD could be of relevance for dialysis patient care, i.e. measurement of heart rate, arrhythmia detection, blood pressure, hyperkalaemia, fluid overload and physical activity. After adequate validation of the different WHD in this specific population, data obtained from WHD could form part of a body area network (BAN), which could serve different purposes such as feedback on actionable parameters like physical inactivity, fluid overload, danger signalling or event prediction. For a BAN to become clinical reality, not only must technical issues, cybersecurity and data privacy be addressed, but also adequate models based on artificial intelligence and mathematical analysis need to be developed for signal optimization, data representation, data reliability labelling and interpretation. Moreover, the potential of WHD and BAN can only be fulfilled if they are part of a transformative healthcare system with a shared responsibility between patients, healthcare providers and the payors, using a step-up approach that may include digital assistants and dedicated 'digital clinics'. The coming decade will be critical in observing how these developments will impact and transform dialysis patient care and will undoubtedly ask for an increased 'digital literacy' for all those implicated in their care.

N2  - Aims: Heart failure (HF) affects approximately 26 million people worldwide. With an aging global population, innovative approaches to HF evaluation and management are needed to cope with the worsening HF epidemic. The aim of the Real-Life Multimarker Monitoring in Patients with Heart Failure (REALIsM-HF) study (NCT03507439) is to evaluate a composite instrument comprising remote, real-time, activity-monitoring devices combined with daily electronic patient-reported outcome (ePRO) items in patients who have been hospitalized for HF and are undergoing standard HF assessment (e.g., 6-min walking distance [6MWD], blood biomarkers, Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire [KCCQ], and echocardiography). Methods: REALIsM-HF is an ongoing, 12-week, observational study enrolling 80-100 patients aged =45 years with HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF; EF =45%) or reduced EF (HFrEF; EF =35%). Statistical analyses will include examining the association between data from wearables (the AVIVO mobile patient management patch or VitalPatch biosensor, and the DynaPort MoveMonitor), daily ePROs, and conventional HF metrics (e.g., serum/plasma biomarkers, 6MWD, KCCQ, and echocardiographic parameters). The feasibility of and patient compliance with at-home devices will be documented, and the data captured for the purpose of establishing reference values in patients with HFpEF or HFrEF will be summarized. Conclusions: The REALIsM-HF study is to evaluate the longitudinal daily activity profiles of patients with HF and correlate these with changes in serum/plasma biomarker profiles, symptoms, quality of life, and cardiac function and morphology to inform the use of wearable activity monitors for developing novel therapies and managing patients.

N2  - Introduction: Future digital health research hinges on methodologies to conduct remote clinical assessments and in-home monitoring. The Collaborative Aging Research Using Technology (CART) initiative was introduced to establish a digital technology research platform that could widely assess activity in the homes of diverse cohorts of older adults and detect meaningful change longitudinally. This paper reports on the built end-to-end design of the CART platform, its functionality, and the resulting research capabilities. Methods: CART platform development followed a principled design process aiming for scalability, use case flexibility, longevity, and data privacy protection while allowing sharability. The platform, comprising ambient technology, wearables, and other sensors, was deployed in participants' homes to provide continuous, long-term (months to years), and ecologically valid data. Data gathered from CART homes were sent securely to a research server for analysis and future data sharing. Results: The CART system was created, iteratively tested, and deployed to 232 homes representing four diverse cohorts (African American, Latinx, low-income, and predominantly rural-residing veterans) of older adults (n = 301) across the USA. Multiple measurements of wellness such as cognition (e.g., mean daily computer use time = 160-169 min), physical mobility (e.g., mean daily transitions between rooms = 96-155), sleep (e.g., mean nightly sleep duration = 6.3-7.4 h), and level of social engagement (e.g., reports of overnight visitors = 15-45%) were collected across cohorts. Conclusion: The CART initiative resulted in a minimally obtrusive digital health-enabled system that met the design principles while allowing for data capture over extended periods and can be widely used by the research community. The ability to monitor and manage health digitally within the homes of older adults is an important alternative to in-person assessments in many research contexts. Further advances will come with wider, shared use of the CART system in additional settings, within different disease contexts, and by diverse research teams.

N2  - In all countries, where electronic health services such as e-prescriptions have been introduced, patient safety has improved and the standard of medical and pharmaceutical care has increased. ePrescription (eRecept) - launched in Hungary as well - has become the most used eHealth module of the EE SZT (National eHealth Infrastructure) by all healthcare providers in the past near 3 years. During the COVID epidemic emergency e-prescription system has been a huge help to patients, relatives and caregivers too. In this period the proportion of electronic issued prescriptions exceeded 90% of all prescriptions written. The e-prescription system contributes to the better and faster information of healthcare professionals, supports the well-based therapy decisions, helps preventing and eliminating medication errors. Adverse drug reactions (allergies, interactions, polypharmacy etc.) can be more easily identified with the daily use of this service. Less paper administration can increase the time and quality of patient counseling both at the doctor's and in the pharmacies. Medication adherence can also be simply monitored by pharmacist as well. After patient registration - using social security number (SSN / TAJ) -, written maximum 1 year earlier and/ or by other pharmacy dispensed prescriptions will be also downloadable soon from the central database. These functions and real time data contribute to the implementation of high-quality pharmacotherapy advising services in pharmacies as healthcare institutions, made in accordance with the specific standards and protocols. The new functions of the Patient Portal (e.g. Legal Representation) and mobile surfaces provide patients and their relatives access to follow their care process, prescriptions, labs, etc., already on their smartphone too. From the beginning of May 2020, serial-produced medical aids mostly sold in pharmacies, can be electronically issued. The full integration of all the medical aids may be completed next year in a separated module. A simple web-based prescriber (socalled miniHIS) has been developed for connected private doctors, who do not consult in institutions. Measured values of the (smart) medical devices can be uploaded into the personal data repository of the Patient Portal on a voluntary basis. Good measurement results of the blood pressure, sugar, body weight, etc. recorded here demonstrate therapy fidelity, providing feedback to the patient and professionals. Telemonitoring services can be build on this module, so the software can send alerts to the assigned doctor, pharmacist or family member. Keeping data protection rules strict, depersonalized pharmacotherapy data uploaded to the central eHealth database will be searchable soon for professional and scientific purposes.
