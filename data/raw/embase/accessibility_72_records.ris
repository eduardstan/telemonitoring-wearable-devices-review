N2  - INTRODUCTION: A modern and accessible healthcare system requires digital innovation and connectivity. The term "Digital health" covers vide range technologies, such as mobile health and applications, electronic records, telehealth and telemedicine, wearable devices, robotics, virtual reality and artificial intelligence. METHODS: Scientometrics is the method that we have done in this study by Cite Space and VOSviewer software, and the result of searching the Web of Science database in plain text format to perform analysis and scientometrics and create outputs in the form of graphs and tables in the field of digital health has been used in stroke rehabilitation. RESULT: A total of 2933 documents related to digital health technologies in stroke rehabilitation were identified by searching for the terms "stroke rehabilitation" or "stroke recovery" in the title and "digital health" across all fields. The strongest citations related to cerebrovascular disease spanned from 1994 to 2007, with randomised clinical trials occurring almost simultaneously and ended by 2012. Consequently, stroke rehabilitation by virtual reality technology has obtained the most citations and clinical trials and as an important part of digital health in the future research process. CONCLUSION: This scientometric study offers insights into how digital health technology can assist stroke patients in self-managing their health and well-being, in addition to supporting integrated stroke rehabilitation. The analysis revealed that three themes were present: author contributors and collaboration networks, temporal evolution, the strongest citation explosions for digital health technologies in stroke rehabilitation research, and semantic analysis.

N2  - Shoulder pain represents the most frequently reported musculoskeletal disorder, often leading to significant functional impairment and pain, impacting quality of life. Home-based rehabilitation programs offer a more accessible and convenient solution for an effective shoulder disorder treatment, addressing logistical and financial constraints associated with traditional physiotherapy. The aim of this systematic review is to report the monitoring devices currently proposed and tested for shoulder rehabilitation in home settings. The research question was formulated using the PICO approach, and the PRISMA guidelines were applied to ensure a transparent methodology for the systematic review process. A comprehensive search of PubMed and Scopus was conducted, and the results were included from 2014 up to 2023. Three different tools (i.e., the Rob 2 version of the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool, the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal tool, and the ROBINS-I tool) were used to assess the risk of bias. Fifteen studies were included as they fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The results showed that wearable systems represent a promising solution as remote monitoring technologies, offering quantitative and clinically meaningful insights into the progress of individuals within a rehabilitation pathway. Recent trends indicate a growing use of low-cost, non-intrusive visual tracking devices, such as camera-based monitoring systems, within the domain of tele-rehabilitation. The integration of home-based monitoring devices alongside traditional rehabilitation methods is acquiring significant attention, offering broader access to high-quality care, and potentially reducing healthcare costs associated with in-person therapy.

N2  - Background: The aging population is steadily increasing, posing new challenges and opportunities for healthcare systems worldwide. Technological advancements, particularly in commercially available Active Assisted Living devices, offer a promising alternative. These readily accessible products, ranging from smartwatches to home automation systems, are often equipped with Artificial Intelligence capabilities that can monitor health metrics, predict adverse events, and facilitate a safer living environment. However, there is no review exploring how Artificial Intelligence has been integrated into commercially available Active Assisted Living technologies, and how these devices monitor health metrics and provide healthcare solutions in a real-world environment for healthy aging. This review is essential because it fills a knowledge gap in understanding AI's integration in Active Assisted Living technologies in promoting healthy aging in real-world settings, identifying key issues that require to be addressed in future studies. Objective: The aim of this overview is to outline current understanding, identify potential research opportunities, and highlight research gaps from published studies regarding the use of Artificial Intelligence in commercially available Active Assisted Living technologies that assists older individuals aging at home. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted in six databases—PubMed, CINAHL, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, ACM Digital Library, and Web of Science—to identify relevant studies published over the past decade from 2013 to 2024. Our methodology adhered to the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews to ensure rigor and transparency throughout the review process. After applying predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria on 825 retrieved articles, a total of 64 papers were included for analysis and synthesis. Results: Several trends emerged from our analysis of the 64 selected papers. A majority of the work (39/64, 61%) was published after the year 2020. Geographically, most of the studies originated from East Asia and North America (36/64, 56%). The primary application goal of Artificial Intelligence in the reviewed literature was focused on activity recognition (34/64, 53%), followed by daily monitoring (10/64, 16%). Methodologically, tree-based and neural network-based approaches were the most prevalent Artificial Intelligence algorithms used in studies (32/64, 50% and 31/64, 48% respectively). A notable proportion of the studies (32/64, 50%) carried out their research using specially designed smart home testbeds that simulate the conditions in real-world. Moreover, ambient technology was a common thread (49/64, 77%), with occupancy-related data (such as motion and electrical appliance usage logs) and environmental sensors (indicators like temperature and humidity) being the most frequently used. Conclusion: Our results suggest that Artificial Intelligence has been increasingly deployed in the real-world Active Assisted Living context over the past decade, offering a variety of applications aimed at healthy aging and facilitating independent living for the older adults. A wide range of smart home indicators were leveraged for comprehensive data analysis, exploring and enhancing the potentials and effectiveness of solutions. However, our review has identified multiple research gaps that need further investigation. First, most research has been conducted in controlled testbed environments, leaving a lack of real-world applications that could validate the technologies' efficacy and scalability. Second, there is a noticeable absence of research leveraging cloud technology, an essential tool for large-scale deployment and standardized data collection and management. Future work should prioritize these areas to maximize the potential benefits of Artificial Intelligence in Active Assisted Living settings.

N2  - Since its introduction in 2014, laser-induced graphene (LIG) from commercial polymers has been gaining interests in both academic and industrial sectors. This can be clearly seen from its mass adoption in various fields ranging from energy storage and sensing platforms to biomedical applications. LIG is a 3-dimensional, nanoporous graphene structure with highly tuneable electrical, physical, and chemical properties. LIG can be easily produced by single-step laser scribing at normal room temperature and pressure using easily accessible commercial level laser machines and materials. With the increasing demand for novel wearable devices for biomedical applications, LIG on flexible substrates can readily serve as a technological platform to be further developed for biomedical applications such as point-of-care (POC) testing and wearable devices for healthcare monitoring system. This review will provide a comprehensive grounding on LIG from its inception and fabrication mechanism to the characterization of its key functional properties. The exploration of biomedicals applications in the form of wearable and point-of-care devices will then be presented. Issue of health risk from accidental exposure to LIG will be covered. Then LIG-based wearable devices will be compared to devices of different materials. Finally, we discuss the implementation of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) to wearable devices and explore and speculate on its potentials and challenges.

N2  - Introduction: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an increasingly prevalent chronic, autoimmune, and inflammatory central nervous system illness, whose common symptoms undermine the quality of life of patients and their families. Recent technical breakthroughs potentially offer continuous, reliable, sensitive, and objective remote monitoring solutions for healthcare. Wearables can be useful for evaluating falls, fatigue, sedentary behavior, exercise, and sleep quality in people with MS (PwMS). Objective: This scoping review of relevant literature explores studies investigating the perceptions of patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs) about the use of wearable technologies in the management of MS. Methods: The Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for scoping reviews was used. The search strategy was applied to the databases, MEDLINE via Ovid, Embase, APA PsycInfo, and CINAHL. Further searches were performed in IEEE, Scopus, and Web of Science. The review considered studies reporting quantitative or qualitative data on perceptions and experiences of PwMS and HCPs concerning wearables’ usability, satisfaction, barriers, and facilitators. Results: 10 studies were included in this review. Wearables’ usefulness and accessibility, ease of use, awareness, and motivational tool potential were patient-perceived facilitators of use. Barriers related to anxiety and frustration, complexity, and the design of wearables. Perceived usefulness and system requirements are identified as facilitators of using wearables by HCPs, while data security concerns and fears of increased workload and limited effectiveness in the care plan are identified as barriers to use wearables. Conclusions: This review contributes to our understanding of the benefits of wearable technologies in MS by exploring perceptions of both PwMS and HCPs. The scoping review provided a broad overview of facilitators and barriers to wearable use in MS. There is a need for further studies underlined with sound theoretical frameworks to provide a robust evidence-base for the optimal use of wearables to empower healthcare users and providers.

N2  - Introduction: In the context of a pandemic-catalyzed movement to home-based healthcare, remote physiologic monitoring (RPM) is more actively emerging as a key tool, including in older patients. However, to our knowledge, limited information is available regarding RPM use in geriatric psychiatry patients. Methods: In concert with the RPM Workgroup of Northwell Health, a quality improvement (QI) initiative was launched to explore RPM feasibility in geriatric psychiatry outpatients. Wearable and non-wearable devices were selected. Geriatric psychiatrists referred appropriate patients from the Geriatric Psychiatry Clinic at Zucker Hillside Hospital in Queens, NY. Explanation/introduction of devices were made to patients, and agreement to participate achieved. The following devices were utilized. The “biobutton’ is a half-dollar sized wearable device that affixes to the chest, and measures heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), sleep and activity. It passively collects data and then intermittently communicates to a nearby relay device which in turn transfers the data to the cloud. An intermediary health technology company then translates the data into a user-friendly dashboard that can be accessed by clinical providers through a portal. Ten patients were recruited for this pilot. The non-wearable devices employed were a blood pressure (BP) cuff and a weight scale with built-in SIM card-based connectivity that enables instant data transmission to a cloud-based clinician dashboard. These devices were demonstrated for patients to ensure familiarity with activation. Both devices were then sent to patients’ homes. Fifteen patients participated. Patients were provided with 24-hour phone support for potential glitches and concerns. Continued participation was based on the integrity of data flow and regular patient follow-ups. At the completion of each program, multi-parameter feasibility/satisfaction surveys (Likert-like 5 point scales; 1 = least favorable, 5 = most favorable) were administered to patients and geriatric psychiatrist providers. Results: Wearable/passive RPM (biobutton): The average scores over all survey questions were respectively 4.7 and 4.0 for patients and providers. Detailed participants’ ratings were: general satisfaction (4.7), satisfaction with the enrollment process (5), satisfaction with device maintenance (4.3), satisfaction with support (5), ease of use (5), interest to continue use (4.2), and recommending to others (4.5). Detailed providers’ ratings were: general satisfaction (3.8), satisfaction with enrollment process (4.8), accessibility of recorded data (4), satisfaction with support during pilot (4.6), clinical utility (3.8), interest to continue use (3.6), recommending to other patients (3.6) and to colleagues (4). Non-wearable/active RPM (BP cuff/weight scale): The average scores over all survey questions were respectively 4.6 and 4.5 for patients and providers. Detailed participants’ ratings were: general satisfaction (4.7), satisfaction with the enrollment process (4.8), satisfaction with device use (4.9), satisfaction with support (4.2), ease of use (4.3), interest to continue use (4.7), and recommending to others (4.9). Detailed providers’ ratings were: general satisfaction (4.5), satisfaction with enrollment process (4.5), accessibility of recorded data (4), satisfaction with support during pilot (4.5), clinical utility (5), interest to continue use (4.5), recommending to other patients (4.5) and to colleagues (4.5).In addition, preliminary qualitative feedback reported regularly encountered glitches with biobutton placement (e.g. inconsistent adhesion of biobutton to chest), consistency of data flow to relay device, and missing expected data points. In contrast, other than the single-size BP cuff being too small for one patient, no other problems were reported using the non-wearable devices. Conclusions: Wearable and non-wearable RPM devices can be successfully applied and utilized in populations of geriatric psychiatry outpatients. Although only a small number of collective patients (n = 25) participated, different age and diagnostic groups were represented, including, e.g., patients who were very old or demented. Overall, patients rated RPM feasibility ‘metrics’ higher than providers. Providers rated overall clinical utility of the biobutton as less meaningful than BP and weight recordings, however further inquiry may reveal differences for individual biobutton parameters (i.e. HR, RR, sleep, activity). Multiple-component RPM had greater challenges and less provider satisfaction, suggesting that device simplicity is especially relevant in this population.

N2  - The aging global population poses significant medical and social challenges, necessitating efforts to promote healthy aging. Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) is a multidimensional diagnostic approach for older adults that aims to improve overall health. Remote CGA, facilitated by technological advancements, offers convenience and other potential advantages. It enables early disease detection, monitors chronic disease progression, delivers personalized care, and optimizes healthcare resources for better health outcomes in older individuals. However, remote CGA also has limitations, including technological requirements, data security, and the need for comprehensive evaluation and simplicity. Collaborative efforts are essential to developing a digital home-based CGA platform that addresses accessibility issues and tailors the assessment process to meet the needs of older adults. Continuous optimization of remote CGA can become a pivotal tool for advancing geriatric care and ensuring the well-being of the aging population. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2024; 24: 67–73.

N2  - Background: Numerous smartphone and tablet applications (apps) are available to monitor movement disorders, but an overview of their purpose and stage of development is missing. Objectives: To systematically review published literature and classify smartphone and tablet apps with objective measurement capabilities for the diagnosis, monitoring, assessment, or treatment of movement disorders. Methods: We systematically searched for publications covering smartphone or tablet apps to monitor movement disorders until November 22nd 2023. We reviewed the target population, measured domains, purpose, and technology readiness level (TRL) of the proposed app and checked their availability in common app stores. Results: We identified 113 apps. Most apps were developed for Parkinson's disease specifically (n = 82; 73%) or for movement disorders in general (n = 17; 15%). Apps were either designed to momentarily assess symptoms (n = 65; 58%), support treatment (n = 22; 19%), aid in diagnosis (n = 16; 14%), or passively track symptoms (n = 11; 10%). Commonly assessed domains across movement disorders included fine motor skills (n = 34; 30%), gait (n = 36; 32%), and tremor (n = 32; 28%) for the motor domain and cognition (n = 16; 14%) for the non-motor domain. Twenty-six (23%) apps were proof-of-concepts (TRL 1–3), while most apps were tested in a controlled setting (TRL 4–6; n = 63; 56%). Twenty-four apps were tested in their target setting (TRL 7–9) of which 10 were accessible in common app stores or as Android Package. Conclusions: The development of apps strongly gravitates towards Parkinson's disease and a selection of motor symptoms. Collaboration, re-use and further development of existing apps is encouraged to avoid reinventions of the wheel.

T1  - PUFchain 3.0: Hardware-Assisted Distributed Ledger for Robust Authentication in Healthcare Cyber-Physical Systems
LA  - English
N2  - This article presents a novel hardware-assisted distributed ledger-based solution for simultaneous device and data security in smart healthcare. This article presents a novel architecture that integrates PUF, blockchain, and Tangle for Security-by-Design (SbD) of healthcare cyber-physical systems (H-CPSs). Healthcare systems around the world have undergone massive technological transformation and have seen growing adoption with the advancement of Internet-of-Medical Things (IoMT). The technological transformation of healthcare systems to telemedicine, e-health, connected health, and remote health is being made possible with the sophisticated integration of IoMT with machine learning, big data, artificial intelligence (AI), and other technologies. As healthcare systems are becoming more accessible and advanced, security and privacy have become pivotal for the smooth integration and functioning of various systems in H-CPSs. In this work, we present a novel approach that integrates PUF with IOTA Tangle and blockchain and works by storing the PUF keys of a patient's Body Area Network (BAN) inside blockchain to access, store, and share globally. Each patient has a network of smart wearables and a gateway to obtain the physiological sensor data securely. To facilitate communication among various stakeholders in healthcare systems, IOTA Tangle's Masked Authentication Messaging (MAM) communication protocol has been used, which securely enables patients to communicate, share, and store data on Tangle. The MAM channel works in the restricted mode in the proposed architecture, which can be accessed using the patient's gateway PUF key. Furthermore, the successful verification of PUF enables patients to securely send and share physiological sensor data from various wearable and implantable medical devices embedded with PUF. Finally, healthcare system entities like physicians, hospital admin networks, and remote monitoring systems can securely establish communication with patients using MAM and retrieve the patient's BAN PUF keys from the blockchain securely. Our experimental analysis shows that the proposed approach successfully integrates three security primitives, PUF, blockchain, and Tangle, providing decentralized access control and security in H-CPS with minimal energy requirements, data storage, and response time.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Successful post-knee replacement rehabilitation requires adequate access to health information, social support, and periodic monitoring by a health professional. Mobile health (mHealth) and computer-based technologies are used for rehabilitation and remote monitoring. The extent of technology use and its function in post-knee replacement rehabilitation care in low and middle-income settings are unknown. OBJECTIVE: To inform future mHealth intervention development, we conducted a scoping review to map the features and functionality of existing technologies and determine users' perspectives on telerehabilitation and technology for self-management. METHODS: We followed the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for scoping reviews. We searched the Embase, Medline, PsycINFO via OVID, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases for manuscripts published from 2001 onward. We included original research articles reporting the use of mobile or computer-based technologies by patients, health care providers, researchers, or family members. Studies were divided into the following 3 categories based on the purpose: validation studies, clinical evaluation, and end user feedback. We extracted general information on study design, technology features, proposed function, and perspectives of health care providers and patients. The protocol for this review is accessible in the Open Science Framework. RESULTS: Of the 5960 articles, 158 that reported from high-income settings contributed to the qualitative summary (64 studies on mHealth or telerehabilitation programs, 28 validation studies, 38 studies describing users' perceptions). The highest numbers of studies were from Europe or the United Kingdom and North America regarding the use of a mobile app with or without wearables and reported mainly in the last decade. No studies were from low and middle-income settings. The primary functions of technology for remote rehabilitation were education to aid recovery and enable regular, appropriate exercises; monitoring progress of pain (n=19), activity (n=20), and exercise adherence (n=30); 1 or 2-way communication with health care professionals to facilitate the continuum of care (n=51); and goal setting (n=23). Assessment of range of motion (n=16) and gait analysis (n=10) were the commonly validated technologies developed to incorporate into a future rehabilitation program. Few studies (n=14) reported end user involvement during the development stage. We summarized the reasons for satisfaction and dissatisfaction among users across various technologies. CONCLUSIONS: Several existing mobile and computer-based technologies facilitate post-knee replacement rehabilitation care for patients and health care providers. However, they are limited to high-income settings and may not be extrapolated to low-income settings. A systematic needs assessment of patients undergoing knee replacement and health care providers involved in rehabilitation, involving end users at all stages of development and evaluation, with clear reporting of the development and clinical evaluation can make post-knee replacement rehabilitation care in resource-poor settings accessible and cost-effective.

N2  - Telemedicine enables the remote provision of medical care through information and communication technologies, facilitating data transmission, patient participation, promotion of heart-healthy habits, diagnosis, early detection of acute decompensation, and monitoring and follow-up of cardiovascular diseases. Wearable devices have multiple clinical applications, ranging from arrhythmia detection to remote monitoring of chronic diseases and risk factors. Integrating these technologies safely and effectively into routine clinical practice will require a multidisciplinary approach. Technological advances and data management will increase telemonitoring strategies, which will allow greater accessibility and equity, as well as more efficient and accurate patient care. However, there are still unresolved issues, such as identifying the most appropriate technological infrastructure, integrating these data into medical records, and addressing the digital divide, which can hamper patients’ adoption of remote care. This article provides an updated overview of digital tools for a more comprehensive approach to atrial fibrillation, heart failure, risk factors, and treatment adherence.

N2  - Physical rehabilitation and exercise training have emerged as promising solutions for improving health, restoring function, and preserving quality of life in populations that face disparate health challenges related to disability. Despite the immense potential for rehabilitation and exercise to help people with disabilities live longer, healthier, and more independent lives, people with disabilities can experience physical, psychosocial, environmental, and economic barriers that limit their ability to participate in rehabilitation, exercise, and other physical activities. Together, these barriers contribute to health inequities in people with disabilities, by disproportionately limiting their ability to participate in health-promoting physical activities, relative to people without disabilities. Therefore, there is great need for research and innovation focusing on the development of strategies to expand accessibility and promote participation in rehabilitation and exercise programs for people with disabilities. Here, we discuss how cutting-edge technologies related to telecommunications, wearables, virtual and augmented reality, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing are providing new opportunities to improve accessibility in rehabilitation and exercise for people with disabilities. In addition, we highlight new frontiers in digital health technology and emerging lines of scientific research that will shape the future of precision care strategies for people with disabilities.

N2  - Purpose: The aim of the study is to assess the experiences, barriers, and expectations regarding current patient monitoring systems among intensive care unit nurses at one university hospital. Methods: A qualitative exploratory study approach was adopted to test the research questions. Results: Intensive care unit personnel placed a high value on practical criteria such as user friendliness and visualization while assessing the present monitoring system. Poor alarm handling was recognized as possible patient safety hazards. The necessity of high accessibility was highlighted once again for a prospective system; wireless, noninvasive, and interoperability of monitoring devices were requested; and smart phones for distant patient monitoring and alert management improvement were required. Conclusion: Core comments from ICU personnel are included in this qualitative research on patient monitoring. All national healthcare involved parties must focus more on user-derived insights to ensure a speedy and effective introduction of digital health technologies in the ICU. The findings from the alarm control or mobile device studies might be utilized to train ICU personnel to use new technology, minimize alarm fatigue, increase medical device accessibility, and develop interoperability standards in critical care practice.

N2  - Introduction: Left Ventricular Assist Devices (LVADs) have emerged as a crucial treatment option for patients with advanced heart failure, either as a bridge to transplant or as a destination therapy. Despite the life-saving potential of LVADs, post-implantation patient management remains challenging, with complications such as infections, device malfunctions, and thrombosis being common. Remote patient monitoring (RPM) systems have shown promising results in improving patient outcomes across various healthcare scenarios. Objective: We aimed to describe the characteristics and outcomes of LVAD patients using remote monitoring system. Method: Patients receiving an LVAD, have been followed by the Satelia® solution, a HF management solution with a remote monitoring system. The system is accessible from any devices, requiring no software installation, no external sensors. This study was conducted in 10 centers in France. Results: This study analyzed a population of 187 patients, predominantly male (81%), with a mean age of 62 years, who underwent LVAD implantation. The majority of the patients had the HM3 type of LVAD (74%) and were treated as a Bridge to transplantation (60%). The main etiology of heart failure in these patients was ischemic in nature (75%) with a mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 23%. Over the course of 17 months (7 days-39 months), patients answered 13,644 questionnaires, resulting in 1,613 red alerts (12%) that were communicated to their cardiologists. The monitoring was primarily discontinued due to death (27%), patient or healthcare professional decision (39%), or other reasons (34%). Additional data regarding the description of the population and the alerts and their resolutions will be presented at the congress. Conclusion: In conclusion, these data may potentially improve patient outcomes by identifying critical alerts in LVAD patients, enabling timely interventions and informing future management strategies in this population.

N2  - Sonification, or the practice of generating sound from data, is a promising alternative or complement to data visualization for exploring research questions in the life sciences. Expressing or communicating data in the form of sound rather than graphs, tables, or renderings can provide a secondary information source for multitasking or remote monitoring purposes or make data accessible when visualizations cannot be used. While popular in astronomy, neuroscience, and geophysics as a technique for data exploration and communication, its potential in the biological and biotechnological sciences has not been fully explored. In this review, we introduce sonification as a concept, some examples of how sonification has been used to address areas of interest in biology, and the history of the technique. We then highlight a selection of biology-related publications that involve sonifications of DNA datasets and protein datasets, sonifications for data collection and interpretation, and sonifications aimed to improve science communication and accessibility. Through this review, we aim to show how sonification has been used both as a discovery tool and a communication tool and to inspire more life-science researchers to incorporate sonification into their own studies.

N2  - Postural instability is associated with disease status and fall risk in Persons with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS). However, assessments of postural instability, known as postural sway, leverage force platforms or wearable accelerometers, and are most often conducted in laboratory environments and are thus not broadly accessible. Remote measures of postural sway captured during daily life may provide a more accessible alterative, but their ability to capture disease status and fall risk has not yet been established. We explored the utility of remote measures of postural sway in a sample of 33 PwMS. Remote measures of sway differed significantly from lab-based measures, but still demonstrated moderately strong associations with patient-reported measures of balance and mobility impairment. Machine learning models for predicting fall risk trained on lab data provided an Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.79, while remote data only achieved an AUC of 0.51. Remote model performance improved to an AUC of 0.74 after a new, subject-specific k-means clustering approach was applied for identifying the remote data most appropriate for modelling. This cluster-based approach for analyzing remote data also strengthened associations with patient-reported measures, increasing their strength above those observed in the lab. This work introduces a new framework for analyzing data from remote patient monitoring technologies and demonstrates the promise of remote postural sway assessment for assessing fall risk and characterizing balance impairment in PwMS.

N2  - Purpose: Cardiovascular disease is a competing mortality cause in hematological cancer survivors due to toxic oncological treatment, accumulation of risk factors, and decline of cardiorespiratory fitness. Cardio-oncology rehabilitation (CORE) is an emerging treatment model to optimize the prognosis of hematological cancer patients and survivors; however, its accessibility during the COVID-19 pandemic is poor. The study aimed to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and effect of a 12-week home-based CORE intervention in telerehabilitation approach among hematological cancer survivors. Methods: A prospective single-arm interventional study was conducted at a faculty hospital in Brno, Czech Republic. This study provided 12 weeks of the home-based CORE using a telerehabilitation approach that allows remote supervision by a clinician from a medical facility. The telerehabilitation approach consists of three components: a heart rate sensor (PolarM430, Kempele, Finland), a web platform compatible with the sensor, and telesupervising via telephone call (1 call per week). To improve adherence, a physiotherapist called participants to assess or address adverse effects, exercise feedback, and participant-related concerns. The anthropometry, body composition, and cardiorespiratory fitness were measured immediately after the intervention. Results: Eleven hematological cancer survivors with an average age of 60.3 ± 10 years participated in the study. Most participants were diagnosed with Follicular lymphoma and received maintenance treatment. Participants had a significant (p < 0.05) increase in cardiorespiratory fitness by 2.6 ml/kg/min; and in peak workload, from 143.3 ± 60.6 W to 158.6 ± 67.5 W (p < 0.05). Improvement in anthropometry and body composition was observed but yielded no statistical significance. Most (80%) participants completed the three times/per week telesupervising exercise session for 12 weeks.No adverse event was identified. Conclusion: Findings from this study suggest that home-based CORE may provide hematological cancer survivors with an increase in CRF during the rehabilitation period after hospital discharge. The telerehabilitation CORE model is effective, feasible, safe, and has demonstrated good adherence. Further randomized controlled efficacy study with larger sample size is needed before clinical implementation. Clinical trial registration: Clinical trial registration number NCT04822389 (30/03/2021).

N2  - Background: Physical disabilities become more common with advancing age. Rehabilitation restores function, maintaining independence for longer. However, the poor availability and accessibility of rehabilitation limits its clinical impact. Artificial Intelligence (AI) guided interventions have improved many domains of healthcare, but whether rehabilitation can benefit from AI remains unclear. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of AI-supported physical rehabilitation technology tested in the clinical setting to understand: 1) availability of AI-supported physical rehabilitation technology; 2) its clinical effect; 3) and the barriers and facilitators to implementation. We searched in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Science Citation Index (Web of Science), CIRRIE (now NARIC), and OpenGrey. Results: We identified 9054 articles and included 28 projects. AI solutions spanned five categories: App-based systems, robotic devices that replace function, robotic devices that restore function, gaming systems and wearables. We identified five randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which evaluated outcomes relating to physical function, activity, pain, and health-related quality of life. The clinical effects were inconsistent. Implementation barriers included technology literacy, reliability, and user fatigue. Enablers included greater access to rehabilitation programmes, remote monitoring of progress, reduction in manpower requirements and lower cost. Conclusion: Application of AI in physical rehabilitation is a growing field, but clinical effects have yet to be studied rigorously. Developers must strive to conduct robust clinical evaluations in the real-world setting and appraise post implementation experiences.

N2  - Telemedicine enables the remote provision of medical care through information and communication technologies, facilitating data transmission, patient participation, promotion of heart-healthy habits, diagnosis, early detection of acute decompensation, and monitoring and follow-up of cardiovascular diseases. Wearable devices have multiple clinical applications, ranging from arrhythmia detection to remote monitoring of chronic diseases and risk factors. Integrating these technologies safely and effectively into routine clinical practice will require a multidisciplinary approach. Technological advances and data management will increase telemonitoring strategies, which will allow greater accessibility and equity, as well as more efficient and accurate patient care. However, there are still unresolved issues, such as identifying the most appropriate technological infrastructure, integrating these data into medical records, and addressing the digital divide, which can hamper patients' adoption of remote care. This article provides an updated overview of digital tools for a more comprehensive approach to atrial fibrillation, heart failure, risk factors, and treatment adherence.

N2  - Introduction: Continuous and non-invasive monitoring of health through digital devices is promising in multiple sclerosis (MS) to early detect relevant changes (e.g., relapses) and consequently anticipate tailored interventions. Objectives/Aims: Aim of this pilot study within the H2020 project ALAMEDA-Bridging the Early Diagnosis and Treatment Gaps of Brain Diseases was to develop an integrated platform collecting patient-centred data from wearables and mobile devices through digital patient-reported outcomes (ePRO) and to test the toolkit's feasibility and usability in people with MS (PwMS). Methods: Data collection has been defined according to MULTIACT shared decisions model involving all relevant stakeholders in the selection of outcomes. These included physical parameters continuously recorded by a smartwatch; ePRO on mobility, cognitive functions, emotional status, daily life and sleep quality periodically administered to users through a smartphone App. Pseudonymised data were stored on the cloud and made accessible to healthcare professionals and researchers using a dashboard. The percentage of completed over scheduled ePRO was calculated as a feasibility outcome. Usability of the toolkit was measured with the System Usability Scale (SUS). Results: 20 PwMS (14 females; age=37.8±6.0 years; all relapsingremitting MS; disease duration=9.1±6.8 years; EDSS=2.2±1.3) were included and asked to use the ALAMEDA toolkit for one year. Half of them reached the 6-month milestone. Users correctly completed 53% of the scheduled ePRO and regularly wore the smartwatch without discomfort. Values of generated data are in line with those reported by the literature (Daily steps=8415±3028; daily minutes of vigorous / moderate / light activity=9.8±9.4 / 14.5±11.7 / 268.7±68.9; daily sedentary minutes=705.1±117.6; Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale-12=37.2±15.7; Arm function in Multiple Sclerosis Questionnaire=47.4±20.4; Perceived Deficit Questionnaire= 25.2±16.4; Beck Anxiety Inventory=17.3±16.0; Modified Fatigue Impact Scale=18.5±14.5; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index=25.2±16.4). SUS revealed high levels of confidence using the system and very high intention to use it in the future. Conclusion: The ALAMEDA toolkit seems feasible and usable to remotely monitor multiple domains of health status in PwMS. Further analysis on the dataset, including Artificial Intelligence and machine learning algorithms, may allow predicting relevant changes throughout the course of MS and anticipating the therapeutic intervention.

N2  - The COVID-19 pandemic and discovery of new mutant strains have a devastating impact worldwide. Patients with severe COVID-19 require various equipment, such as ventilators, infusion pumps, and patient monitors, and a dedicated medical team to operate and monitor the equipment in isolated intensive care units (ICUs). Medical staff must wear personal protective equipment to reduce the risk of infection. This study proposes a tele-monitoring system for isolation ICUs to assist in the monitoring of COVID-19 patients. The tele-monitoring system consists of three parts: medical-device panel image processing, transmission, and tele-monitoring. This system can monitor the ventilator screen with obstacles, receive and store data, and provide real-time monitoring and data analysis. The proposed tele-monitoring system is compared with previous studies, and the image combination algorithm for reconstruction is evaluated using structural similarity index (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). The system achieves an SSIM score of 0.948 in the left side and a PSNR of 23.414 dB in the right side with no obstacles. It also reduces blind spots, with an SSIM score of 0.901 and a PSNR score of 18.13 dB. The proposed tele-monitoring system is compatible with both wired and wireless communication, making it accessible in various situations. It uses camera and performs live data monitoring, and the two monitoring systems complement each other. The system also includes a comprehensive database and an analysis tool, allowing medical staff to collect and analyze data on ventilator use, providing them a quick, at-a-glance view of the patient's condition. With the implementation of this system, patient outcomes may be improved and the burden on medical professionals may be reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic-like situations.

N2  - Breast cancer related lymphedema (BCRL) is a common, debilitating condition that can affect up to one in five breast cancer surviving patients (BCSP). BCRL can significantly reduce the quality of life (QOL) of patients and poses a significant challenge to healthcare providers. Early detection and continuous monitoring of lymphedema is crucial for the development of client-centered treatment plans for post-cancer surgery patients. Therefore, this comprehensive scoping review aimed to investigate the current technology methods used for the remote monitoring of BCRL and their potential to facilitate telehealth in the treatment of lymphedema. Initially, five electronic databases were systematically searched and analyzed following the PRISMA flow diagram. Studies were included, specifically if they provided data on the effectiveness of the intervention and were designed for the remote monitoring of BCRL. A total of 25 included studies reported 18 technological solutions to remotely monitor BCRL with significant methodological variation. Additionally, the technologies were categorized by method of detection and wearability. The findings of this comprehensive scoping review indicate that state-of-the-art commercial technologies were found to be more appropriate for clinical use than home monitoring, with portable 3D imaging tools being popular (SD 53.40) and accurate (correlation > 0.9, p < 0.05) for evaluating lymphedema in both clinic and home settings with expert practitioners and therapists. However, wearable technologies showed the most future potential for accessible and clinical long-term lymphedema management with positive telehealth outcomes. In conclusion, the absence of a viable telehealth device highlights the need for urgent research to develop a wearable device that can effectively track BCRL and facilitate remote monitoring, ultimately improving the quality of life for patients following post-cancer treatment.

N2  - PURPOSE: This article demonstrates the leadership role of the clinical nurse specialist in developing and implementing healthcare technology across the continuum of care. DESCRIPTION: Three virtual nursing practices-facilitated self-care, remote patient monitoring, and virtual acute care nursing-illustrate how the clinical nurse specialist is well suited to transform traditional practice models to ones that use healthcare technology effectively. These 3 practices use interactive healthcare technology to gather patient data and allow communication and coordination with the healthcare team to meet patient-specific needs. OUTCOME: Use of healthcare technology in virtual nursing practices led to early care team intervention, optimized care team processes, proactive patient outreach, timely access to care, and reduction in healthcare-associated errors and near-miss events. CONCLUSION: Clinical nurse specialists are well positioned to develop innovative, effective, accessible, and high-quality virtual nursing practices. Integrating healthcare technology with nursing practice augments care for various patients, ranging from those with low illness severity in the outpatient setting to acutely ill patients in the inpatient hospital environment.

N2  - The rapid evolution of digital health technologies (DHTs) has provided new opportunities in geriatric healthcare for remote patient communication, education, diagnostic assessment, and the personalised, remote delivery and monitoring of home-based preventive and rehabilitative services for older adults. Despite the appeal of such technologies, it is first important to evaluate whether they are safe, feasible, acceptable, and reliable, as well as effective for improving health outcomes. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, a growing number of researchers and healthcare professionals have shifted to remote assessments of physical function, a critical element of all geriatric assessments to identify at-risk populations and guide personalised prevention and management programs. This presentation will summarise the findings of a series of studies we (and others) have conducted to determine the feasibility, acceptability, reliability and validity of commonly used physical function tests when conducted either under remote supervision (via videoconferencing) or self-administered (after watching instructional videos) within the homes of older adults, along with the role of wearable sensors and apps to evaluate functional performance and falls. DHTs have also provided viable, equitable and highly accessible opportunities for the remote delivery and monitoring of personalised, evidence-based exercise and lifestyle self-management programs to older adults and those with chronic diseases where and when they need it with timely communication between clients/patients and healthcare providers. This presentation will provide an update on the current evidence related to the effectiveness and acceptability of different digital health interventions for the management of musculoskeletal conditions and prevention of falls. It will also include an overview of our experiences in designing and delivering mobile health interventions for older adults using smart device apps/platforms that incorporate remotely delivered, narrated video-based exercise prescription, in-app logging of exercise completion, remote monitoring and feedback and online education and health messages to promote self-management. Finally, challenges and barriers identified by end-users and healthcare providers will also be presented.

N2  - Background: Nurse engagement, perceived need and usefulness affect healthcare technology use, acceptance and improvements in quality, safety and accessibility of healthcare. Nurses’ opinions regarding continuous monitoring appear to be positive. However, facilitators and barriers were little studied. This study explored nurses’ post-implementation experiences of the facilitators and barriers to continuously monitoring patients’ vital signs using a wireless device on general hospital wards. Methods: This study employed a cross-sectional survey. Vocational and registered nurses from three general wards in a Dutch tertiary university hospital participated in a survey comprising open and closed questions. The data were analysed using thematic analysis and descriptive statistics. Results: Fifty-eight nurses (51.3%) completed the survey. Barriers and facilitators were identified under four key themes: (1) timely signalling and early action, (2) time savings and time consumption, (3) patient comfort and satisfaction and (4) preconditions. Conclusions: According to nurses, early detection and intervention for deteriorating patients facilitate the use and acceptance of continuously monitoring vital signs. Barriers primarily concern difficulties connecting patients correctly to the devices and system.

N2  - Background & Aims: There remains limited understanding of factors such as patient quality of life on a day-to-day basis in Sickle Cell Disease (SCD), with monitoring often limited to annual patient reviews and clinic attendances within a healthcare setting. This study aimed to explore an approach to assess quality of life in patients with SCD through a remote monitoring ecosystem accessible from patients' own homes, and with this, what potential impact such tracking may have upon patient wellbeing. Methods: The patient ecosystem provided a clinically validated wearable for live remote monitoring of metrics (e.g., activity, sleep, and heart rate); a digital portal for input of patient-reported outcomes (PROs); and a digital platform of live and retrospective insights, healthcare timelines, and data entry - a 'digital patient wallet' - encapsulating their combined data, including medical records. Patients provided informed e-consent to participate and for analysis of their de-identified data, with no dropouts. Patients who had (1) participated for at least 5 months, (2) recorded a minimum of 5 EQ-5D scores across their first 30 days with the programme, and (3) recorded a minimum of 5 entries across the most recent 30 days were analysed (n=23). Percentage changes between the first and most recent 30-day average EQ-5D scores were calculated, to assess any potential changes since patients began utilising the ecosystem, as well as the statistical significance of any differences in EQ-5D between these timepoints. Results: In comparison to their initial 30-day average, 78% (18/23) of patients showed an overall increase in average EQ-5D score by their most recent 30-day period, with 35% (8/23) showing a statistically significant change (p<0.05). In contrast, 22% (5/23) of patients showed an overall decrease in EQ-5D, however, only 4% (1/23) recorded a statistically significant change. Early trends highlight a potential, albeit not statistically significant, emerging link between patient engagement rates with EQ-5D reporting (number of entries/days since first entry) and the percentage change in their EQ-5D score, with increasing engagement rates correlating with increasing percentage changes in EQ-5D score. Conclusions & Future Steps: This work provides an early look at the potential impacts consistent monitoring of PROs may have on patient wellbeing. While not necessarily a causal relationship, it highlights early indications that this form of PRO monitoring may be beneficial to patient outcomes, potentially through heightened engagement with patient self-reporting and therefore self-monitoring to support disease management and behavioural changes. However, such findings may also be influenced by factors including the wearable biometric monitoring component, health events patients may have experienced over this period, as well as differences in the time of year patients joined the programme - environmental factors and temperature known to impact patient wellbeing in SCD. A key goal will be to increase the period of longitudinal data collection for more in-depth comparison within a larger volume of patients. Future steps will incorporate direct causal analysis, investigate whether these changes are impacted by each individual's starting point, and explore any associated changes in patients' physical health - building a stronger understanding of patient outcomes and quality of life in SCD, and the approaches that can be taken to improve this.

N2  - The early detection of fatal diseases is crucial for medical diagnostics and treatment, both of which benefit the individual and society. Portable devices, such as thermometers and blood pressure monitors, and large instruments, such as computed tomography (CT) and X-ray scanners, have already been implemented to collect health-related information. However, collecting health information using conventional medical equipment at home or in a hospital can be inefficient and can potentially affect the timeliness of treatment. Therefore, on-time vital signal collection via healthcare monitoring has received increasing attention. As the largest organ of the human body, skin delivers significant signals reflecting our health condition; thus, receiving vital signals directly from the skin offers the opportunity for accessible and versatile non-invasive monitoring. In particular, emerging flexible and stretchable electronics demonstrate the capability of skin-like devices for on-time and continuous long-term health monitoring. Compared to traditional electronic devices, this type of device has better mechanical properties, such as skin conformal attachment, and maintains compatible detectability. This review divides the health information that can be obtained from skin using the sensor aspect's input energy forms into five categories: thermoelectrical signals, neural electrical signals, photoelectrical signals, electrochemical signals, and mechanical pressure signals. We then summarize current skin-wearable health monitoring devices and provide outlooks on future development.

N2  - Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with a fast increasing prevalence. Several pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions are available to alleviate symptoms. Technology can be used to improve the efficiency, accessibility and feasibility of these treatments. Although many technologies are available, only few are actually implemented in daily clinical practice. Aim: Here, we study the barriers and facilitators, as experienced by patients, caregivers and/or healthcare providers, to successful implement technology for PD management. Methods: We performed a systematic literature search in the PubMed and Embase databases until June 2022. Two independent raters screened the titles, abstracts and full texts on: 1) people with PD; 2) using technology for disease management; 3) qualitative research methods providing patients’, caregivers and/or healthcare providers’ perspective, and; 4) full text available in English or Dutch. Case studies, reviews and conference abstracts were excluded. Results: We found 5420 unique articles of which 34 were included in this study. Five categories were made: cueing (n = 3), exergaming (n = 3), remote monitoring using wearable sensors (n = 10), telerehabilitation (n = 8) and remote consultation (n = 10). The main barriers reported across categories were unfamiliarity with technology, high costs, technical issues and (motor) symptoms hampering the use of some technologies. Facilitators included good usability, experiencing beneficial effects and feeling safe whilst using the technology. Conclusion: Although only few articles presented a qualitative evaluation of technologies, we found some important barriers and facilitators that may help to bridge the gap between the fast developing technological world and actual implementation in day-to-day living with PD.

N2  - Telemedicine and remote patient monitoring (RPM) systems have been gaining interest and received adaptation in healthcare sectors since the COVID-19 pandemic due to their efficiency and capability to deliver timely healthcare services while containing COVID-19 transmission. These systems were developed using the latest technology in wireless sensors, medical devices, cloud computing, mobile computing, telecommunications, and machine learning technologies. In this article, a real-time remote patient monitoring system is proposed with an accessible, compact, accurate, and low-cost design. The implemented system is designed to an end-to-end communication interface between medical practitioners and patients. The objective of this study is to provide remote healthcare services to patients who need ongoing care or those who have been discharged from the hospital without affecting their daily routines. The developed monitoring system was then evaluated on 1177 records from MIMIC-III clinical dataset (aged between 19 and 99 years). The performance analysis of the proposed system achieved 88.7% accuracy in generating alerts with logistic regression classification algorithm. This result reflects positively on the quality and robustness of the proposed study. Since the processing time of the proposed system is less than 2 minutes, it can be stated that the system has a high computational speed and is convenient to use in real-time monitoring. Furthermore, the proposed system will fulfil to cover the lower doctor-to-patient ratio by monitoring patients from remote locations and aged people who reside in their residences.

N2  - Background: Poison centers play an important role in medical management of poisoning exposures. In 2021, there were 2,080,917 human exposures reported to US poison centers with 93% occurring in a residence, and 67% managed on site. Home management could be increased and would be safer with knowledge of real time vital signs (VS). Abnormal VS often precede clinical deterioration and their early detection could allow for therapeutic intervention in the home setting to either allow a patient to remain at home or quickly identify the need to seek in person medical care. Patient convenience and healthcare cost savings are potential benefits of remote patient monitoring devices (RPMDs). The purpose of this study was to compare RPMD VS collection to in-hospital nursing VS collection for toxicologic exposures. Methods: This was a prospective, cohort study in a large, academic, urban hospital from 1 May 2021 to 31 December 2021. Admitted toxicology consultations were reviewed daily for eligibility. Patients > 18 years and able to consent were enrolled from non-intensive care settings. All participating patients had informational study flyers hung at bedside. Informed consent was obtained. This study was approved by the local Institutional Review Board. BioSticker™ is FDA approved for remote patient monitoring. Sensors transmit data via Bluetooth to a bedside hub device which streams participants' heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR) securely to a remotely accessible HIPAAcompliant web portal. Patients wore the device for the duration of their admission while also receiving routine VS checks by nurses. Nurses were blinded to device VS readings. Researchers accessed nurse-collected data from the electronic medical record. Device data was averaged over one hour and compared to corresponding nurse VS timestamps. Data was collected in Excel® and statistical analyses were performed. Device data consistency was assessed using the percentage of manual VS timepoints for which device VS data was retrievable. Device-collected and nurse-collected VS agreement was determined using the mean of the differences between corresponding VS pairs and Bland Altman plot. Results: Four patients were enrolled in the study. Mean patient age was 36.25 years, two were female, and devices were worn 12-48 hours among the four patients (1). Data collected by BioSticker™successfully streamed HR and RR for 97.0% of all nurse VS checks. Two patients experienced bradycardia and two patients experienced tachypnea (1). The mean differences between nurse and device values for HR and RR were -4.2 bpm and 2.3 rpm, respectively. There were 18 VS abnormalities (17 HR and 2 RR) detected by nursing VS collection and 26 by BioSticker™ (25 HR and 1 RR). Bland Altman plots display generally consistent agreement across the range of measurement. Conclusions: BioSticker™ demonstrated overall concordance in VS collection with hospital nursing and reliability. While the sample size was small, the potential for the use of RMPDs is demonstrated in the fidelity of VS collection, relatively low mean differences and Bland Altman concordance. Future, larger studies, including with patient experience surveys, are needed.

N2  - Introduction: Do assistive technologies (AT) enhance QoL of older people and care professionals in long-term care facilities? We have previously reported on the impact of using a monitoring system with an infrared camera and communication robots (Obayashi et al. 2020). Further improvements were made to the detection accuracy of the camera, and functionalities for verbal interaction were added. This paper reports on these efforts in nursing homes, and their impact on the ground. Methods: The study was conducted with 34 older people and 20 care professionals in nursing homes. An infrared sensor and a biosensor were installed on the ceiling of each resident's room. When the camera detects movement by the resident, it notifies the care staff via the mobile terminal. Its detection accuracy was improved against sunlight and physical obstacles. A variety of qualitative and quantitative data (e.g. sleeping patterns and social participation of older people, system usability and staff task analysis) were collected before and after installation. Communication functions were added to the system. Results: False detection rates of the monitoring camera decreased significantly. Using the improved system for the duration of 34 days, 602 alerts were recorded in total and 430 staff visits to rooms during night shifts were spared. The task analysis revealed that time available for direct caregiving increased (e.g. direct communication: From 2 to 55 min), while indirect care activities decreased. After the introduction of communicative functions, system usability decreased, primarily due to inaudibility. However, the qualitative data support the idea of an interactive system. Key conclusions: Faced with the challenge of meeting increasing demand for person-centered care under limited resources, there will be a greater need for better integration of improved AT. The study indicates AT's potential for enhancing the quality of care for all.

N2  - Introduction: The use of venous catheters is often associated with complications occurrence inherent to catheter indwelling in the patient but also to the type of fluid used, which is why patient surveillance becomes crucial, not only for the user but also for health professionals to prevent complications. Since these devices have an extremely specific application, their accessibility can become complex when applied to bedridden people, because of their positioning but also due to the clothing they use, which normally does not have the ideal conditions of design and type of textile (i.e., minimal flexibility, reduced openings). Method: This study comprised an approach based on the evaluation of a textile prototype designed (under the project 4NoPressure) to prevent the occurrence of pressure injuries for the evaluation of an innovative device through a focus group with 19 experts, health professionals with experience in the area of care and how garments may or may not facilitate the performance of health professionals in handling devices on the people themselves or even in accessing and monitoring vascular access. Results: After an analysis carried out by a group of experts, new materials with a specific design promotes thermophysiological control of the skin's microclimate. It was verified that clothing in the form of 2-piece pajamas should be easy to handle with a practical opening system, in the central region or sleeves for easy access to medical devices (i.e., puncture, placement of external fasteners, among others), as well as for their monitoring and avoiding side seams that can promote pressure sore formation. Discussion & Conclusion: In this way, it verified and encouraged the need to establish more multidisciplinary teams aimed at the development of new products not only innovative but also with preventive action to respond to some existing gaps in the market in the health sector.

N2  - Background: The use of remote digital technologies in the homes of people with motor neuron disease (MND) has the potential to reduce the burden, and improve the accessibility and personalization of care and clinical trials by enabling tailored collection of disease-related outcomes from home. To date, there is limited information available regarding patient preferences for remote digital technology use. Objectives: To capture the patient's attitude toward remote monitoring of MND in care and clinical trials, and their concerns and preferences regarding the use of digital technology. Methods: We performed an international multi-center survey study in three MND clinics in The Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Australia. The survey was co-developed by investigators and patients with MND, and sent to patients by e-mail or postal-mail. The main topics included: patients' attitude toward remote care, participating in decentralized clinical trials, and preferences for and concerns with digital technology use. Results: In total, 332 patients with MND participated. A majority of patients indicated they would be happy to selfmonitor their health from home (69%), be remotely monitored by a multidisciplinary care team (75%), and would be willing to participate in clinical trials from home (65%). Patients considered respiratory function and muscle strength most valuable for home-monitoring. The majority of patients considered the use of at least three devices/apps (75%) once a week (61%) to be acceptable for home-monitoring. Fifteen percent of patients indicated they would not wish to perform home-measurements; they reported concerns about the burden and distress of home-monitoring, privacy and data security. Conclusion: Most patients with MND exhibited a positive attitude toward the use of digital technology in both care and clinical trial settings. A subgroup of patients reported concerns with home-monitoring, which should be addressed in order to improve widespread adoption of remote digital technology in clinical MND care.

N2  - Background: Over decades, efforts to shave off life-saving minutes from ST-Elevated Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) care centred on reducing doorto- needle and door-to-balloon times. We firmly believe that symptom-toballoon time should prove a better focus to this end. Challenges come with this goal as it heavily relies on a patient's perception and initiative to seek care, which we deem intelligent and wearable Artificial Intelligence (AI)- driven Single Lead EKG technologies as an attractive solution in modernday cardiology. Purpose: To provide an accurate, accessible, and cost-effective AI-driven Single Lead STEMI detection algorithm that can be embedded into wearable devices and employed in a self-administered fashion. Methods: Database: EKG records from Mexico, Colombia, Argentina, and Brazil from April 2014 to December 2019. Dataset: A total of 11,567 12- lead EKG records of 10[s] length with a sampling frequency of 500 Hz, including the following balanced classes: Angiographically confirmed and unconfirmed STEMI, branch blocks, non-specific ST-T abnormalities, normal and abnormal (200+ CPT codes, excluding those mentioned above). Cardiologists manually checked the label of each record to ensure precision. Pre-processing: We discard the first and last 250 samples as they may contain a standardisation pulse. The study applied a digital low pass filter of order 5 with a frequency cut-off of 35 Hz. The mean was subtracted from each Lead. Classification: The determined classes were STEMI (Including STEMI in different locations of the myocardium - anterior, inferior, and lateral); and Not-STEMI (Combination of randomly sample, branch blocks, non-specific ST-T changes, and abnormal records - 25% of each). Training and Testing: A 1-D Convolutional Neural Network was trained and tested with a dataset proportion of 90/10, respectively. A different model was trained and tested for each Lead, using the central 4,500 samples of the records. The last dense layer outputs a probability for each report of being STEMI or Not-STEMI. Lead V2 showed the best overall results. The model was further tested through the same methodology using the best Lead with a subset of the previous data, excluding the unconfirmed STEMI EKG records (Total 7,230 12-lead EKG records for Confirmed Only STEMI dataset). Performance metrics were reported for each experiment and compared. Results: Combined STEMI data: Accuracy: 91.2%; Sensitivity: 89.6%; Specificity: 92.9%. Confirmed STEMI Only dataset: Accuracy: 92.4%; Sensitivity: 93.4%; Specificity: 91.4% (Figure 1). Conclusion: By assiduously improving the quality of the model's input, we continue to assess our algorithm's performance and reliability for future clinical validation as a potential remote monitoring and early STEMI detection device.

N2  - Aim: To understand parental awareness and appetite for virtual health modalities, including asynchronous communication and remote monitoring. To understand which socio-demographic characteristics are associated with greater awareness and appetite for virtual health. Methods: Nationally representative survey of Australian parents, recruited via an online panel in February 2021 as part of the Royal Children's Hospital National Child Health Poll. Participants were randomly selected from the consumer panel. Results: 1981 (59.4% response rate) parents completed the survey. 39.9% were aware of virtual health care, defined by digital technology and medical devices to support remote monitoring. Higher levels of awareness were associated with being male, having previous teleconsultation experience, higher education attainment and employment. Most parents reported an appetite for asynchronous communication using an app or website to either provide information prior to a consult (65.9%), provide a photo of a rash or similar (61.7%) or receive medical advice (58.1%). Appetite for wearable devices was similar at 59.9%. Conclusions: Whilst awareness of virtual healthcare was low, appetite exists amongst Australian parents to use technology to support their child's health care. Health-care models, which incorporate asynchronous communication or symptom monitoring through apps, are likely to be acceptable and offer an accessible and sustainable alternative to traditional face-to-face health care.

KW  - telemedicine
N2  - Recent developments in smart mobile devices (SMDs), wearable sensors, the Internet, mobile networks, and computing power provide new healthcare opportunities that are not restricted geographically. This paper aims to introduce Mobilemicroservices Architecture (MMA) based on a study on architectures. In MMA, an HTTP-based Mobilemicroservivce (MM) is allocated to each SMD's sensor. The key benefits are extendibility, scalability, ease of use for the patient, security, and the possibility to collect raw data without the necessity to involve cloud services. Feasibility was investigated in a two-year project, where MMA-based solutions were used to collect motor function data from patients with Parkinson's disease. First, we collected motor function data from 98 patients and healthy controls during their visit to a clinic. Second, we monitored the same subjects in real-time for three days in their everyday living environment. These MMA applications represent HTTP-based business-logic computing in which the SMDs' resources are accessible globally.

N2  - RATIONALE: Auscultation of lung sounds has remained a major challenge to remote patient monitoring, telemedicine including tele-ICU management and post discharge care whether hospitalization resulted from exacerbation or surgery. The Strados Labs Remote Electronic Stethoscope Platform (RESPTM) is the first and only device that offers the clinical staff access to the patient remotely with a wearable device, adhered to the chest wall and designed to capture all lung sounds and transmit them through AWS or SD card retrieval for annotation, interpretation recording and uploading to a clinician accessible portal. METHODS: Volunteers with cardiopulmonary diseases were recruited from the patient population. The placement of the device was based on auscultation of the chest and identification of the optimal site for capturing diffuse lung sounds, including rales, rhonchi, wheezes, cough and intrathoracic sounds not otherwise specified. These studies compared direct auscultation at 4 sites on the chest with adjacent recording using the Littmann3200® stethoscope, followed by removal of 2 RESPTM wearables and finally one wearable, creating a 4:2:1 paradigm. Acoustic recordings were then compared by at least 3 board certified clinicians masked to patient diagnosis and chest wall placement. Some volunteers were asked to cough, swallow, perform a “glottal stop,” count, and breathe deeply at rest and while ambient noise (music) played. Respiratory rate was independently captured using chest wall motion sensing. RESULTS: 10 patients participated in the first study, with no dropouts. The RESPTM provided high fidelity data access substantially similar to the Littmann3200 across a range of patients (COPD, asthma, CHF, chronic cough), with no loss of accuracy or fidelity decreasing from 4 devices to 1. All sounds have been archived. In the second study, the RESPTM was affixed to patients with chronic cough for 8 hours of continuous recording. Together with data from other patients, the RESPTM system was validated for cough counting and provided unique insights into cough architecture and intrathoracic versus extra-thoracic cough origin. CONCLUSION: rigorous testing is required to validate the utility of a remote device to capture and annotate lung sounds. Strados Labs has validated the utility and robustness of the RESPTM in studies designed to stress test the system and to provide the basis for algorithm development and improved nurse: physician collaboration.

N2  - Background: Cancer is likely to remain the most prevalent noncommunicable disease in high-income countries with an older population. Interestingly, no review of attitudes toward telemedicine among older adults has been performed. This is likely to be the group most affected by both cancer and the increasing use of technology in health care. Objective: We aimed to map research on the acceptance of telemedicine among older adults who are cancer patients. Methods: We conducted a scoping review. PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were systematically searched from inception to September 2020. Articles were included if the study population had a mean or median age ≥65 years, with cancer diagnoses and if the study assessed patients’ acceptance of a telemedicine intervention. Quantitative, qualitative, and mixed method studies were included. Results: Out of a total of 887 articles that were identified, 19 were included in the review. Interventions were delivered via telephone, videoconference, web portal, mobile app, wearable technology, and text messaging and included teleconsultation, monitoring and follow-up, psychosocial support and nursing care, and prompts. The most often cited facilitating factor was convenience. Other facilitators included an increase in telemedicine care accessibility, previous positive experiences of telemedicine, appropriate technical knowledge and support, decreased cost, physician recommendations, and privacy conferred by the telemedicine intervention. Barriers include a preference for conventional care along with negative perceptions of telemedicine, concerns about technical difficulties, and confidentiality concerns in the adoption of telemedicine. Conclusions: None of the studies explored the ability of tailored interventions to address facilitators and barriers of the acceptance of telemedicine in order to increase its adoption by older adults. Facilitators and barriers will likely differ across different cultural contexts and by type of telemedicine; however, this is a gap in current knowledge. In-depth studies are necessary to determine if interventions could potentially address the barriers identified in this review, to increase acceptability.

N2  - Digital health tools encompass a wide range of technologies that have been used in healthcare services including mobile applications, health information technology, smart wearable devices, remote monitoring and treatment, and health platforms. These tools walk a fine line between lifestyle consumer products and medical devices. Sleep applications can be used by consumers as a fun gadget to track sleep, but it may also be used as a medical tool to collect information concerning serious sleep disorders. The fast proliferation of these tools has put pressure on concerned stakeholders to make sense of this group of technologies. Various questions have been raised within this realm: What counts as medical as opposed to a lifestyle device? Which devices require regulation and under what standards? Which devices are allowed to be used in the medical context? And which are not? And under what conditions? Social scientists have highlighted the complexity of digital health tools that (include both medical and lifestyle characteristics and the difficulties accompanied with classifying these tools for regulatory purposes. In an attempt to do so, several regulatory bodies including the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have revised their existing standards to accommodate the regulation of digital health tools. As such, the FDA published a guidance document on Mobile Medical Applications; this led to various concerns questioning the boundaries between lifestyle and medical digital technologies that were defined by the FDA guidelines, which left a significant number of technologies that were considered to be low-risk, completely out of the FDA oversight and with no required compliance/quality control/effectiveness checks. This prompted many companies to develop hundreds of products that belong to the low-risk category, granting them the ability to ignore FDA regulations. Consequently, there remains considerable concern regarding the quality and safety of these digital health technologies that are being used within the medical context. Clear and well-defined regulation processes are needed to control the development and design of these tools, especially that many lack scientific evidence and data privacy. The framework ought to include a risk-based approach to classify devices for regulation in a way to ensure the safety and effectiveness of all digital health tools throughout their life cycle, even those classified as low-risk. The framework and regulatory process also need to take into consideration the rapid change in digital product development, as processes that extend for a long period of time may become obsolete in supporting decisions about these tools. As these digital health tools become more sophisticated, accessible, widespread, and cheaper, the need for classifying and regulating the sector becomes important, especially with the rapid evolution of these technologies.

N2  - Wearable sensors in healthcare monitoring have recently found widespread applications in biomedical fields for their non- or minimal-invasive, user-friendly and easy-accessible features. Sensing materials is one of the major challenges to achieve these superiorities of wearable sensors for healthcare monitoring, while graphene-based materials with many favorable properties have shown great efficiency in sensing various biochemical and biophysical signals. In this paper, we review state-of-the-art advances in the development and modification of graphene-based materials (i.e., graphene, graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide) for fabricating advanced wearable sensors with 1D (fibers), 2D (films) and 3D (foams/aerogels/hydrogels) macroscopic structures. We summarize the structural design guidelines, sensing mechanisms, applications and evolution of the graphene-based materials as wearable sensors for healthcare monitoring of biophysical signals (e.g., mechanical, thermal and electrophysiological signals) and biochemical signals from various body fluids and exhaled gases. Finally, existing challenges and future prospects are presented in this area.

N2  - Rapid diagnosis and treatment application in the early stages of H. pylori infection plays an important part in inhibiting the transmission of this infection as this bacterium is involved in various gastric pathologies such as gastritis, gastro-duodenal ulcer, and even gastric neoplasia. This review is devoted to a quick overview of conventional and advanced detection techniques successfully applied to the detection of H. pylori in the context of a compelling need to upgrade the standards of the diagnostic methods which are currently being used. Selecting the best diagnostic method implies evaluating different features, the use of one or another test depending on accessibility, laboratories equipment, and the clinical conditions of patients. This paper aims to expose the diagnosis methods for H. pylori that are currently available, highlighting their assets and limitations. The perspectives and the advantages of nanotechnology along with the concept of nano(bio)sensors and the development of lab-on-chip devices as advanced tools for H. pylori detection, differentiation, and discrimination is also presented, by emphasizing multiple advantages: simple, fast, cost-effective, portable, miniaturized, small volume of samples required, highly sensitive, and selective. It is generally accepted that the development of intelligent sensors will completely revolutionize the acquisition procedure and medical decision in the framework of smart healthcare monitoring systems.

N2  - Rationale: With the advent of the EMR, patient-generated health data (PGHD) has become more accessible, allowing for a patient-centered approach to the management of chronic asthma. Combined with artificial intelligence and remote monitoring, this data has the potential to predict asthma exacerbations and prognosis in individualized patient populations. Methods: Utilizing PRISMA guidelines, a literature search was conducted using the search terms “asthma,” “artificial intelligence,” “PGHD,” “exacerbations,” “prognosis,” and related terms. The search for this scoping review was conducted on PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Science, and EMBASE. Inclusion criteria consisted of articles published from January 2011 onwards and written in English. Duplicates were removed and review papers, abstracts, presentations, and grey literature were excluded. Results: The literature search yielded 377 articles. A preliminary review was conducted based on inclusion criteria, resulting in 15 articles. The top three variables for PGHD included vital sign monitoring via wearables (7 articles), patient-reported symptomatology (6 articles), and an element of pulmonary function testing (6 articles). Demographics and environmental exposures were each reported in 2 articles. Various forms of AI were used, the most common being random forest classifiers (6 articles). Conclusions: Existing literature has demonstrated that the utilization of PGHD in combination with AI promotes the adoption of precision medicine in asthma management. Given the heterogeneity of asthma, the ability to compute and relay real-time data to the patient and the provider can aid in the prediction and management of asthma exacerbations, but more data on demographics and environmental exposures should be considered to improve individualized prognostics.

N2  - Introduction: Patient initiated, remote cardiac monitoring has proved to be a significant advance in the diagnosis and management of arrhythmias. Further improvements in ease of use and access to results will further improve health outcomes and cost-effectiveness. Here we describe a proof-of-concept evaluation to assess the feasibility of successfully implementing a cloud-based management system using KardiaPro (KP) for remote electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring to interface into EPIC, an enterprise electronic health record (EHR) system. Methods: The KP management system was embedded using hypertext markup language (HTML) code directly into the EHR. Encrypted credentials and patient data were bundled with an application programming interface key allowing linkage of remote monitoring from patients’ smartphones. During the time of implementation, a total of 322 patients and 32 179 ECGs were recorded. Results: The KP-EHR interface provided full functionality, allowing detection, interpretation and documentation of atrial fibrillation (AF), flutter events, ventricular tachycardia, and complete heart block. Our study focused on KP’s detection of AF, and 16.7% of tracings were classified as probable AF with only 2.3% of tracings not analyzed by the KP algorithm because of tracings that were too noisy or truncated. Enhanced management was facilitated with clinical information immediately accessible. Blinded physician ECG review validated the KP proprietary algorithm interpretation and ECGs. Conclusions: Direct integration of KP into EHR was successful and practical. It allows for historical, point of care and immediate retrieval of remote ambulatory monitoring data and documentation into the electronic health record. KP EHR integration warrants further study as it has the potential to improve cost-effectiveness and clinical diagnostic value, leading to improvements in delivery of patient care.

N2  - Introduction: Remote monitoring (RM) of cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIED) allows rapid detection of clinical and electrical events. Recently, several smartphone applications have been developed with the aim of improving patient compliance and better interpreting and integrating data deriving from remote control for the management of heart failure (HF). Areas covered: Studies investigating the role of CIEDs’ RM in HF patients to predict and early treat acute decompensation. The importance of new technologies and applications developed to provide crucial information to clinicians, to better manage HF patients. Expert opinion: New medical technologies and smartphone applications for CIEDs’ RM were developed to help clinicians in the management of CIED carriers. Indeed, the accessibility of technological devices (e.g. smartphones) and the improvements in medical technology provide the opportunity to optimize HF patients’ monitoring by the transmission of device-related data, and with direct involvement of patients themselves. Thanks to these advancements, physicians have the possibility to recognize worsening signs of HF and promptly optimize treatments to potentially avoid hospitalization. The great value of this approach is its potential of reducing scheduled in-office visits or unnecessary medical contacts and optimizing healthcare resources management.

To be more specific, the Internet of Things (IoT) has showed promise in connecting a variety of medical devices, sensors, and healthcare specialists in order to provide high-quality medical treatment in a remote place. Patient safety has improved, healthcare expenses have decreased, healthcare services have become more accessible, and the healthcare industry's operational efficiency has increased. In this paper, a diabetic patient monitoring strategy is proposed that uses an IoT-based machine learning technique called eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) to support in diabetes diagnosis and classification. A successful implementation of any classifier requires proper hyperparameter optimization. This work employed Bayesian optimization, which is a very effective method for hyper-parameter optimization, to optimize the hyper-parameters of XGBoost. The efficacy of the suggested method is assessed in terms of accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and F1score. It outperforms better than the other existing algorithms.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Urolithiasis is a clinically and socially significant disease that requires long-term follow-up in order to prevent stone recurrence. Currently, telemedicine consultations in the "patient-doctor" format are actively used in urology, however, the methodology, technological base and assessment of the efficiency of remote monitoring of the patient's health status are virtually not developed. AIM: To provide basics for the methodology of remote monitoring of patients with urolithiasis for detailed comprehensive examination and comprehensive metaphylaxis of recurrent stone formation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive clinical examination was carried out on the basis of the Institute of Urology and Human Reproductive Health, the National Medical Research Center on Urology and the Institute of Digital Medicine of FGAOU VO I.M. Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University during the period from 1st February to 1st December 2020. A total of 30 patients with urolithiasis were included in the study. Remote monitoring of health status was carried out using a portable analyzer "ETTA AMP-01" on dipstick. Data transmission was performed through a mobile application, which is part of the "NetHealth" information system (www.nethealth.ru). The values and frequency of urine tests performed by the patient independently, as well as patient satisfaction and adherence to the monitoring technology were evaluated. Analytical, clinical, sociological and statistical research methods were used. RESULTS: By systematizing published data and our own clinical experience, we have developed a model for remote monitoring of the health status of patients with urinary stone disease, which included a system of indications and contraindications, a program and an order of the monitoring, as well as a basic technological solution (medical devices and a hardware-software complex). In this study, median duration of remote monitoring was 168 days. According to the questionnaire, general positive assessment and desire to continue telemonitoring was seen in 100.0% of cases, while 86.7% of patients positively evaluated the technical accessibility and reliability of the system and 93.3% considered the quality and availability of medical care as high. CONCLUSION: A methodology for remote monitoring of patients with urolithiasis has been developed with the aim of preventing recurrent stone formation. There was a high adherence of patients to remote monitoring with a tendency to decrease in values after 4 and 6 months. During these periods, it is necessary to carry out routine consultations by the physician who appointed remote monitoring in order to continue the follow-up program. There was a high satisfaction of patients with remote monitoring, and they pointed out the quality and availability of urological care owing to telemedicine technologies.

N2  - On account of privacy preserving issue and health-care monitoring, physiological signal biometric authentication system has gained popularity in recent years. Seismocardiogram (SCG) is now easily accessible owing to the advance of wearable sensor technology. However, SCG biometric has not been widely explored due to the challenging motion artifact removal. In this paper, we design placing the sensors at different body parts under different activities to determine the best sensor location. In addition, we develop SCG noise removal algorithm and utilize machine learning approach to perform biometric authentication tasks. We validate the proposed methods on 20 healthy young adults. The dataset contains acceleration data of sitting, standing, walking, and sitting post-exercise activities with the sensor placed at the wrists, neck, heart and sternum. We demonstrate that vertical and dorsal-ventral SCG near the heart and the sternum produce reliable SCG biometric evidenced by achieving the state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, we present the efficacy of the devised noise removal procedure in the authentication during walking motion.Clinical relevance- A seismocardiography-based biometric authentication system can help serve privacy preserving and reveal cardiovascular functioning information in clinics.

N2  - RATIONALE: The ability to closely track the exercise tolerance of patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) in the outpatient setting is typically limited by the resources required for repeat testing. To address this limitation, we developed an Apple Watch based app to enable patients to perform daily six minute walk tests (6MWT's) remotely. To test the app's utility and accuracy we are performing a single-center, feasibility trial enrolling participants with PAH on either stable or augmented PAH therapy (NCT03893500). Methods: All patients receiving care for PAH at Stanford Hospital meeting the study's inclusion and exclusion criteria and deemed good candidates by their PAH provider are approached to participate. Patients who consent are provided with an Apple Watch and instructed on loading the Walk.Talk.Track. App (WTT) and performing a 6MWT using the watch. Concurrent, in-clinic, supervised indoor and outdoor 6MWTs are performed at the baseline and 3-month follow up visits to assess app accuracy. De-identified data collected by the WTT app is transmitted to a secure cloud server, and is analyzed by the study team on a routine basis. Results: To date we have approached 75, and enrolled 29 PAH patients. These patients have 47 yrs median age, 83% female, with a broad range of WHO functional classes (31% I, 55% II, and 14% III). Participants have completed 814 6MWT's since study start, accounting for 210 patient-weeks of exposure (average 3.9 walks/week). The mean difference between WTT app measured distance and the observed gold standard was 8.54±102.2 meters indoor (N=24), and 67.34±68.7 meters for outdoor settings (N=21), respectively. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of WTT measured walks was 0.77. Technical limitations of the WTT app resulted in 18 walks being omitted from analysis, and an additional 16 walks not recorded (as reported by participants), with an overall device nonperformance rate of 4.2%. Only one, self-limited adverse event related to the study (contact dermatitis) was reported. There have been no reports of dyspnea, angina, or falls related to performing 6MWTs. Conclusion: The WTT app allows for accessible, frequent remote assessment of patient exercise tolerance that is reproducible (ICC 0.77), and can be performed by patients with a wide range of functional class without significant adverse effects. High temporal resolution of exercise tolerance has the potential to guide more rapid clinical decision making, and detect patient decompensation sooner. However, refinement through fusion of different watch sensor data is needed to improve accuracy.

N2  - Background: The wearable cardioverter-defibrillator (WCD) can be prescribed in patients with newly diagnosed heart failure. The WCD provides additional heart failure parameters, like heart rate, step count and body position, accessible via remote monitoring. The purpose of this study was to evaluate clinical relevance of additionally recorded data in patients using the WCD. Methods: Patients with newly diagnosed heart failure and WCD, an average wear time with at least 20 hours per day and available heart failure parameters were included. The heart failure parameters were provided in 5-minute data intervals. An approximate for the heart rate variability was calculated via the standard deviation of the cycle length of the given heart rate per 5-minute data interval (HRV5). Results: 276 patients (68% male) were included between 04/2013 and 12/2017. Mean age was 57.4 ± 15.3 years. 174 patients (63%) suffered from non-ischemic and 102 patients (37%) from ischemic cardiomyopathy. Mean NYHA functional class at prescription was 2.6 ± 0.8. Mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 25.3 ± 8.5%. Mean wear time of the WCD was 111.8 ± 74.5 days. Recorded median heart rate using the WCD was 70.8 (IQR 63.1 - 78.7) beats per minute on the first wear day and 64.5 (IQR 59.7 - 71.3) on the last wear day. Median step count amounted to 4294 (IQR 2283 - 7092) steps on the first wear day compared to 5688 (IQR 3153 - 8263) steps on the last wear day. Median HRV5 was 85.4 (IQR 60.1 - 109.8) ms on the first wear day and 110.4 (IQR 78.6 - 134.9) ms on the last wear day. Between the first and last seven days of usage, median heart rate was significantly reduced (69.5 (IQR 62.0 - 76.8) to 65.9 (IQR 60.4 - 72.2) beats per minute; p < 0.001), while median step counts per day (4657 (IQR 2778 - 6918) to 5562 (IQR 3890 - 8446) steps; p < 0.001) and HRV5 (89.0 (IQR 64.8 - 110.7) to 111.0 (IQR 83.7 - 134.7) ms; p < 0.001) were significantly elevated. A higher delta of heart rate correlated with a higher delta of HRV5A (p < 0,001; rs = 0.488) between the first and last seven days of usage. A higher delta of step counts per day in the first and last seven days correlated with a higher HRV5 (p < 0.001; rs = 0.320). Patients with a higher delta of step count per day (p = 0,005; rs = 0,189) and patients with a higher delta of HRV5 (p = < 0.001; rs = 0.255) showed a higher delta of LVEF measured at prescription and three months follow-up. Conclusion: The WCD provides heart failure monitoring using additional heart failure parameters. Patients with newly diagnosed heart failure show a significant difference in heart rate, step count per day and heart rate variability approximate between beginning and end of prescription time. Step count and heart rate variability correlate with LVEF reverse remodeling. Remote monitoring for parameters regarding heart failure might be helpful for close monitoring and further heart failure therapy optimization during WCD wearing.

N2  - Objective: Intermittent claudication (IC) can severely limit functional capacity and quality of life. Supervised exercise therapy is the recommended first line management; however, this is often limited by accessibility, compliance and cost. As such, there has been an increased interest in the use of wearable activity monitors (WAMs) in home based telemonitoring exercise programmes for claudicants. This review aims to evaluate the efficacy of WAM as a feedback and monitoring tool in home based exercise programmes for patients with IC. Data Sources: A search strategy was devised. The databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched through to April 2020. Review Methods: Randomised trials and prospective trials were included. Eligible trials had to incorporate WAMs as a feedback tool to target walking/exercise behaviour. The primary outcome was the change in walking ability. Study quality was assessed with risk of bias tool. Results: A total of 1148 records were retrieved. Of these, eight randomised controlled trials and one prospective cohort study, all of which compared a WAM intervention against standard care and/or supervised exercise, met the inclusion criteria. Owing to heterogeneity between studies, no meta-analysis was conducted. WAM interventions improved measures of walking ability (heterogeneous outcomes such as maximum walking distance, claudication distance and six minute walk distance), increased daily walking activity (steps/day), cardiovascular metrics (maximum oxygen consumption), and quality of life. Conclusion: There is some evidence that home based WAM interventions are beneficial for improving walking ability and quality of life in patients with IC. However, existing studies are limited by inadequate sample size, duration, and appropriate power. Achieving consensus on outcome reporting and study methods, as well as maximising device adherence, is needed.

N2  - This article presents a continuous home telemonitoring system for chronic respiratory patients using 5G connectivity developed in partnership with Vodafone as a part of the 5G Trial in Milan established by the Italian Ministry of Economic Development. The system features a wearable respiratory and activity monitor, an environmental sensor and a pulse oximeter sending the data through a 5G router to a Multi-Edge Computing server, incorporated in the Vodafone 5G infrastructure, where they are stored and accessible for visualization. In particular, activity, respiratory and environmental data are continuously streamed and collected. The solution has been tested on 18 healthy volunteers during non-supervised recordings lasting at least 48 hours. The combination of recognized activities and associated respiratory parameters provided statistically significant variations in breathing patterns between one activity and the other, thus giving more complete information to the clinicians than previously studied telemedicine systems based on spot-checks. In particular, statistically significant differences are found in tidal volume and minute ventilation between horizontal and vertical postures (p < 0.001) and between vertical postures and dynamic activities (p < 0.001); the respiratory rate shows statistically significant differences between horizontal and vertical postures (p < 0.001). Some environmental parameters have different mean values between day and night, such as carbon dioxide (p < 0.001). Trials on patients are needed to further study this telemedicine solution and make it commercially available in the future. The main further technical development suggested is the use of commercial 5G smartphones as routers, in order to make the system usable outside of home settings.

N2  - The COVID-19 global pandemic has had striking effects on clinical practice and medical assistance and the progressive evolution of telemedicine and telehealth systems has allowed healthcare professionals to connect with patients yet respecting the striking need for social distancing. This article aims to review the possible ways to use telehealth and teleconsulting systems to guarantee an adequate level of clinical assistance starting from screening procedures up to support the management of patients admitted to intensive care units area, thus balancing the need to ensure continuity of care and at the same time limiting the possible sources of contagion expansion. Telemedicine may be a useful tool to improve clinical assistance and reduce the financial burden on the health system in a long-term view. Although it cannot completely replace patient-physician interactions, it would be desirable to implement this field and made it accessible to the largest part of the population.

N2  - Healthcare studies are moving toward individualised measurement. There is need to move beyond supervised assessments in the laboratory/clinic. Longitudinal free-living assessment can provide a wealth of information on patient pathology and habitual behaviour, but cost and complexity of equipment have typically been a barrier. Lack of supervised conditions within free-living assessment means there is need to augment these studies with environmental analysis to provide context to individual measurements. This paper reviews low-cost and accessible Internet of Things (IoT) technologies with the aim of informing biomedical engineers of possibilities, workflows and limitations they present. In doing so, we evidence their use within healthcare research through literature and experimentation. As hardware becomes more affordable and feature rich, the cost of data magnifies. This can be limiting for biomedical engineers exploring low-cost solutions as data costs can make IoT approaches unscalable. IoT technologies can be exploited by biomedical engineers, but more research is needed before these technologies can become commonplace for clinicians and healthcare practitioners. It is hoped that the insights provided by this paper will better equip biomedical engineers to lead and monitor multi-disciplinary research investigations.

N2  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is a system of wireless, interrelated, and connected digital devices that can collect, send, and store data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction. The IoT promises many benefits to streamlining and enhancing health care delivery to proactively predict health issues and diagnose, treat, and monitor patients both in and out of the hospital. Worldwide, government leaders and decision makers are implementing policies to deliver health care services using technology and more so in response to the novel COVID-19 pandemic. It is now becoming increasingly important to understand how established and emerging IoT technologies can support health systems to deliver safe and effective care. The aim of this viewpoint paper is to provide an overview of the current IoT technology in health care, outline how IoT devices are improving health service delivery, and outline how IoT technology can affect and disrupt global health care in the next decade. The potential of IoT-based health care is expanded upon to theorize how IoT can improve the accessibility of preventative public health services and transition our current secondary and tertiary health care to be a more proactive, continuous, and coordinated system. Finally, this paper will deal with the potential issues that IoT-based health care generates, barriers to market adoption from health care professionals and patients alike, confidence and acceptability, privacy and security, interoperability, standardization and remuneration, data storage, and control and ownership. Corresponding enablers of IoT in current health care will rely on policy support, cybersecurity-focused guidelines, careful strategic planning, and transparent policies within health care organizations. IoT-based health care has great potential to improve the efficiency of the health system and improve population health.

N2  - Internet of Things (IoT) technologies have been applied to various fields such as manufacturing, automobile industry and healthcare. IoT-based healthcare has a significant impact on real-time remote monitoring of patients’ health and consequently improving treatments and reducing healthcare costs. In fact, IoT has made healthcare more reliable, efficient, and accessible. Two major drawbacks which IoT suffers from can be expressed as: first, the limited battery capacity of the sensors is quickly depleted due to the continuous stream of data; second, the dependence of the system on the cloud for computations and processing causes latency in data transmission which is not accepted in real-time monitoring applications. This research is conducted to develop a real-time, secure, and energy-efficient platform which provides a solution for reducing computation load on the cloud and diminishing data transmission delay. In the proposed platform, the sensors utilize a state-of-the-art power saving technique known as Compressive Sensing (CS). CS allows sensors to retrieve the sensed data using fewer measurements by sending a compressed signal. In this framework, the signal reconstruction and processing are computed locally on a Heterogeneous Multicore Platform (HMP) device to decrease the dependency on the cloud. In addition, a framework has been implemented to control the system, set different parameters, display the data as well as send live notifications to medical experts through the cloud in order to alert them of any eventual hazardous event or abnormality and allow quick interventions. Finally, a case study of the system is presented demonstrating the acquisition and monitoring of the data for a given subject in real-time. The obtained results reveal that the proposed solution reduces 15.4% of energy consumption in sensors, that makes this prototype a good candidate for IoT employment in healthcare.

N2  - Eccrine sweat is a rich, accessible biofluid comprised of a mixture of electrolytes, metabolites, hormones, and cytokines. Collection of sweat typically relies on absorbent pads that are incompatible with remote monitoring and deployment in field settings due to contaminants in the pads, long-term exposure of sweat to skin, and the need for centrifuges for extraction. Recent advances in the development of wearable microfluidic sensors that capture and analyze sweat dynamics offer new possibilities for tracking sweat biomarkers. This study presents a novel, wearable microfluidic device (the ‘Discovery patch’) that carefully captures small sweat volumes (10-150 μL), quantifies rates of excretion, and supports extraction for external lab analysis. Discovery patches were skin-mounted on the forearms of healthy subjects (n=10) who perspired in an environment chamber (40-45°C). Sweat captured in the Discovery patch was extracted and stored in cryovials, frozen, then analyzed by immunoassay to quantify cytokines (IL-1α, IL-1RA, and IL-8) across 3 anatomic regions (upper forearm and bilateral lower forearms). IL-1α and IL-1RA were present at significant quantities (2.0±1.6 and 2.9±2.9 ng/mL, respectively), whereas IL-8 was near the noise floor (1.1±0.7 pg/mL). Moreover, IL-1α and IL-1RA concentrations were independent of sweat rate (R2=0.1 and R2=0.02) and anatomic region (p=0.93 and p=0.99), and demonstrated diurnal fluctuations (p<0.01 and p<0.05, respectively), a striking phenomenon reported previously in serum tests. These results show that the Discovery patch is a robust tool for non-invasive tracking of inflammation biomarkers. Future directions include assessment of sweat cytokines in atopic dermatitis patients to locally monitor flare-ups and enable individualized tracking of patient responses to drug treatment.

N2  - Background: Adhesive capsulitis (AC) of the shoulder is a common disorder that painfully reduces the shoulder range of motion (ROM) among middle-aged individuals. Although physical therapy with home-based exercises is widely advised to restore ROM in the treatment of AC, clinical results vary owing to inconsistent patient compliance. Objective: In this study, we aimed to verify the feasibility of a treatment model that involves applying a wearable motion sensor device to assist patients conduct home-based exercises to improve training compliance and the accuracy of exercises, with the ultimate goal of improving the functional recovery of patients with AC. Methods: The motion sensor device was comprised of inertial measurement unit-based sensors and mobile apps for patients and physicians, offering shoulder mobility tracing, home-based exercise support, and progress monitoring. The interrater reliability of shoulder mobility measurement using the motion sensor device on 10 healthy participants and 15 patients with AC was obtained using an intraclass correlation coefficient analysis and compared with the assessments performed by two highly experienced physicians. A pilot prospective control trial was then carried out to allocate the 15 patients with AC to two groups: home-based exercise group and motion sensor-assisted rehabilitation group. Changes in active and passive shoulder ROM, pain and functional scores, and exercise completion rates were compared between the groups during a treatment period of 3 months. Results: Shoulder ROM, as measured using the motion sensor device, exhibited good to excellent reliability based on the comparison with the measurements of two physicians (intraclass correlation coefficient range, 0.771 to 0.979). Compared with patients with AC in the home-based exercise group, those in the motion sensor-assisted rehabilitation group exhibited better shoulder mobility and functional recovery and a higher exercise completion rate during and after 3 months of rehabilitation. Conclusions: Motion sensor device-assisted home-based rehabilitation for the treatment of AC is a useful treatment model for telerehabilitation that enhances the compliance of patients through training, thus improving functional recovery. This helps overcome important obstacles in physiotherapy at home by providing comprehensible and easily accessible exercise instructions, enhancing compliance, ensuring the correctness of exercise, and monitoring the progress of patients.

N2  - After a cerebral stroke, survivors need to follow a neurorehabilitation program including exercises to be executed under a therapist's supervision or autonomously. Technological solutions are needed to support the early discharge of the patients just after the primary hospital treatments, by still providing an adequate level of rehabilitation. The DoMoMEA Project proposes a fully-wearable m-health solution able to administer a neurorehabilitation therapy in the patient's home or every other place established by the patient for a rehabilitation session. The exploitation of magneto-inertial measurement units only, wirelessly connected to an Android-operated device, provides robustness to different operating conditions and immunity to optical occlusion problems, compared to RGB-D cameras. Patients' engagement is fostered by the exploitation of the exergame version of the ten rehabilitation exercises, implemented in Unity 3D. Store-and-forward telemonitoring features, supported by cloud-based storage and by a web application accessible from anywhere by medical personnel and patients, enable constant transparent monitoring of the rehabilitation progresses. The clinical trial of the DoMoMEA telerehabilitation system will involve 40 post-stroke patients with mild impairment and will start as soon as the restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic will allow to enroll patients.

N2  - The increasing ageing global population is causing an upsurge in ailments related to old age, primarily dementia and Alzheimer's disease, frailty, Parkinson's, and cardiovascular disease, but also a general need for general eldercare as well as active and healthy ageing. In turn, there is a need for constant monitoring and assistance, intervention, and support, causing a considerable financial and human burden on individuals and their caregivers. Interconnected sensing technology, such as IoT wearables and devices, present a promising solution for objective, reliable, and remote monitoring, assessment, and support through ambient assisted living. This paper presents a review of such solutions including both earlier review studies and individual case studies, rapidly evolving in the last decade. In doing so, it examines and categorizes them according to common aspects of interest such as health focus, from specific ailments to general eldercare; IoT technologies, from wearables to smart home sensors; aims, from assessment to fall detection and indoor positioning to intervention; and experimental evaluation participants duration and outcome measures, from acceptability to accuracy. Statistics drawn from this categorization aim to outline the current state-of-the-art, as well as trends and effective practices for the future of effective, accessible, and acceptable eldercare with technology.

N2  - Phosphorus recovery from urine is a sustainable approach. However, the challenge of this process is the accessibility of economically feasible magnesium sources. This study aimed to investigate the potential of low-cost Rift Valley Lake magnesium (RVL-Mg) source for phosphorus recovery from urine, where data is deficient in the source area. The effect of various operational conditions such as storage, Mg:P ratio (0.8–2.0), pH (5.5–10.5), mixing speed (30–180 rpm), urease enzyme addition (50–700 μL), urine dilution (0.11–9.0) and Ca:Mg ratio (0.3–2.5) was investigated. Under optimum operating conditions (M:P = 1.6, pH = 9, urease enzyme = 500 μL, mixing speed = 120 rpm, 60 min precipitation), the phosphorus removal efficiencies were >96% for actual and >98% for synthetic urine. During storage, spontaneous phosphorus losses were observed from synthetic (24.0%) and actual (32.0%) hydrolyzed urine due to precipitation with calcium and magnesium. The phosphorus recovery efficiency was reduced at higher (0.11:1) and lower (9:1) urine to RVL-Mg dilution, which is related to lower supersaturation of phosphorus and magnesium ions, respectively. Addition of calcium did not affect phosphorus removal efficiency, but the effect was significant on crystal product. With low (<1.0) Ca:Mg ratio, the crystal chemical analysis showed that the product has to be pure struvite (>99%), which was further identified by scanning electron microscope and X-ray diffraction to be quality struvite that might be used for agricultural purpose. Overall, low-cost magnesium ion collected from Rift Valley Lake can be a potentially candidate for sustainable phosphorus recovery from urine and any other phosphorus containing waste stream.

N2  - Mobile and wearable technologies offer patients with diabetes mellitus new possibilities for data collection and their more effective analysis. The Diabesdagboga smartphone application and the Diani web portal enable to collect and analyze glycaemia values, carbohydrates intake, insulin doses and the level of physical activity. The data are not only accessible in the corresponding smartphone but also automatically transferred to an Internet portal, where they may be completed by the records from an electronic pedometer and continuous glucose monitor. All these data may then be displayed in various types of graphical outputs and are available to both the patient and the physician. The case report of a patient who has used the system for almost two years shows a significant improvement in metabolic compensation (a decrease in the mean HbA1c value by 18.6 mmol/mol as compared with the previous period).

N2  - Due to the serious impact of falls on the autonomy and health of older people, the investigation of wearable alerting systems for the automatic detection of falls has gained considerable scientific interest in the field of body telemonitoring with wireless sensors. Because of the difficulties of systematically validating these systems in a real application scenario, Fall Detection Systems (FDSs) are typically evaluated by studying their response to datasets containing inertial sensor measurements captured during the execution of labelled nonfall and fall movements. In this context, during the last decade, numerous publicly accessible databases have been released aiming at offering a common benchmarking tool for the validation of the new proposals on FDSs. This work offers a comparative and updated analysis of these existing repositories. For this purpose, the samples contained in the datasets are characterized by different statistics that model diverse aspects of the mobility of the human body in the time interval where the greatest change in the acceleration module is identified. By using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) on the series of these features, the comparison shows the significant differences detected between the datasets, even when comparing activities that require a similar degree of physical effort. This heterogeneity, which may result from the great variability of the sensors, experimental users, and testbeds employed to generate the datasets, is relevant because it casts doubt on the validity of the conclusions of many studies on FDSs, since most of the proposals in the literature are only evaluated using a single database.

N2  - Telemonitoring is a branch of telehealth that aims at remotely monitoring vital signs, which is important for chronically ill patients and the elderly living alone. The available standalone devices and applications for the self-monitoring of health parameters largely suffer from interoperability problems; meanwhile, telemonitoring medical devices are expensive, self-contained, and are not integrated into user-friendly technological platforms for the end user. This paper presents the technical aspects and usability assessment of the telemonitoring features of the HEREiAM platform, which supports heterogeneous information technology systems. By exploiting a service-oriented architecture, the measured parameters collected by off-the-shelf Bluetooth medical devices are sent as XML documents to a private cloud that implements an interoperable health service infrastructure, which is compliant with the most recent healthcare standards and security protocols. This Android-based system is designed to be accessible both via TV and portable devices, and includes other utilities designed to support the elderly living alone. Four usability assessment sessions with quality-validated questionnaires were performed to accurately understand the ease of use, usefulness, acceptance, and quality of the proposed system. The results reveal that our system achieved very high usability scores even at its first use, and the scores did not significantly change over time during a field trial that lasted for four months, reinforcing the idea of an intuitive design. At the end of such a trial, the user-experience questionnaire achieved excellent scores in all aspects with respect to the benchmark. Good results were also reported by general practitioners who assessed the quality of their remote interfaces for telemonitoring.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Pregnancy is an ideal opportunity for women to focus on physical health; however, exercise recommendations are rarely met. At-home fitness is more accessible than ever due to technology-based interventions, and with the addition of wearable technology, real-time adherence and intensity feedback is possible. The objective of our study is to determine if contemporaneous, mobile technology can provide an innovative method to monitor exercise in a high-risk pregnant population remotely. METHODS: This is a prospective, randomized controlled pilot study with two arms: exercise vs. standard counseling. Exercise was logged and tracked remotely in both groups. Once an exercise session was recorded, participation was confirmed by cross-referencing participant's FitBit activity and heart rate monitor (San Francisco, CA), thus providing a method to confirm participation and monitor degree of exercise intensity. RESULTS: Sixteen total patients were enrolled, eight in each arm. 102 exercise sessions were logged: 80 (78%) in the intervention group vs. 22 (22%) in the non. Exercise was confirmed in 79 of the 102 exercise sessions (77%). Interestingly, only 18% of recorded sessions reached moderate intensity based on heart rate parameters, and none reached vigorous intensity. CONCLUSION: Connected health technologies can provide a reliable, cost effective, and efficient method to determine adherence to and degree of exercise intensity in a high-risk pregnant population. Providing feedback to patients about their actual vs. perceived exercise intensity may improve the efficacy of their regimens. Additional research is needed to determine which methods are most effective to motivate exercise in pregnancy.
