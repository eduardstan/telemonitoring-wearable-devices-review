N2  - Background: Multi-parametric assessment, including heart sounds in addition to conventional parameters, may enhance the efficacy of noninvasive telemonitoring for heart failure (HF). We sought to assess the feasibility of self-telemonitoring with multiple devices including a handheld heart sound recorder and its association with clinical events in patients with HF. Methods: Ambulatory HF patients recorded their own heart sounds, mono‑lead electrocardiograms, oxygen saturation, body weight, and vital signs using multiple devices every morning for six months. Results: In the 77 patients enrolled (63 ± 13 years old, 84 % male), daily measurements were feasible with a self-measurement rate of >70 % of days in 75 % of patients. Younger age and higher Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire scores were independently associated with lower adherence (p = 0.002 and 0.027, respectively). A usability questionnaire showed that 87 % of patients felt self-telemonitoring was helpful, and 96 % could use the devices without routine cohabitant support. Six patients experienced ten HF events of re-hospitalization and/or unplanned hospital visits due to HF. In patients who experienced HF events, a significant increase in heart rate and diastolic blood pressure and a decrease in the time interval from Q wave onset to the second heart sound were observed 7 days before the events compared with those without HF events. Conclusions: Self-telemonitoring with multiple devices including a handheld heart sound recorder was feasible even in elderly patients with HF. This intervention may confer a sense of relief to patients and enable monitoring of physiological parameters that could be valuable in detecting the deterioration of HF.

N2  - Background: More responsive, reliable, and clinically valid endpoints of disability are essential to reduce size, duration, and burden of clinical trials in adult persons with spinal muscular atrophy (aPwSMA). Objective: The aim is to investigate the feasibility of smartphone-based assessments in aPwSMA and provide evidence on the reliability and construct validity of sensor-derived measures (SDMs) of mobility and manual dexterity collected remotely in aPwSMA. Methods: Data were collected from 59 aPwSMA (23 walkers, 20 sitters and 16 non-sitters) and 30 age-matched healthy controls (HC). SDMs were extracted from five smartphone-based tests capturing mobility and manual dexterity, which were administered in-clinic and remotely in daily life for four weeks. Reliability (Intraclass Correlation Coefficients, ICC) and construct validity (ability to discriminate between HC and aPwSMA and correlations with Revised Upper Limb Module, RULM and Hammersmith Functional Scale - Expanded HFMSE) were quantified for all SDMs. Results: The smartphone-based assessments proved feasible, with 92.1% average adherence in aPwSMA. The SDMs allowed to reliably assess both mobility and dexterity (ICC > 0.75 for 15/22 SDMs). Twenty-one out of 22 SDMs significantly discriminated between HC and aPwSMA. The highest correlations with the RULM were observed for SDMs from the manual dexterity tests in both non-sitters (Typing, ρ= 0.78) and sitters (Pinching, ρ= 0.75). In walkers, the highest correlation was between mobility tests and HFMSE (5 U-Turns, ρ= 0.79). Conclusions: This exploratory study provides preliminary evidence for the usability of smartphone-based assessments of mobility and manual dexterity in aPwSMA when deployed remotely in participants' daily life. Reliability and construct validity of SDMs remotely collected in real-life was demonstrated, which is a pre-requisite for their use in longitudinal trials. Additionally, three novel smartphone-based performance outcome assessments were successfully established for aPwSMA. Upon further validation of responsiveness to interventions, this technology holds potential to increase the efficiency of clinical trials in aPwSMA.

KW  - wearable computer
N2  - Telehealth and remote patient monitoring (RPM), in particular, have been through a massive surge of adoption since 2020. This initiative has proven potential for the patient and the healthcare provider in areas such as reductions in the cost of care. While home-use medical devices or wearables have been shown to be beneficial, a literature review illustrates challenges with the data generated, driven by limited device usability. This could lead to inaccurate data when an exam is completed without clinical supervision, with the consequence that incorrect data lead to improper treatment. Upon further analysis of the existing literature, the RPM Usability Impact model is introduced. The goal is to guide researchers and device manufacturers to increase the usability of wearable and home-use medical devices in the future. The importance of this model is highlighted when the user-centered design process is integrated, which is needed to develop these types of devices to provide the proper user experience.

N2  - Background: Mobile technology is increasingly prevalent in healthcare, serving various purposes, including remote health monitoring and patient self-management, which could prove beneficial to early hospital discharges. Aims: This study investigates the transitional care program experience facilitating early discharges in a pediatric setting through the use of an easy-to-use mobile medical device (TytoCare™, TytoCare Ltd., Natanya, Israel). Outcomes: This study aims to assess the effectiveness of telehomecare in achieving complete resolution of diseases without readmission, compare the length of stay between intervention and standard care groups, and gather user and professional experiences. Methods: A randomized open-label, controlled pilot study enrolled 102 children, randomly assigned to the telehomecare (TELE) group (n = 51, adopting early hospital discharge with continued home monitoring) or the standard-of-care (STAND) group (n = 51). Primary outcomes include complete disease resolution without readmission. Secondary objectives include recording a shorter length of stay in the intervention group. Surveys on user and professional experiences were conducted. A group of 51 children declining telemedicine services (NO-TELE) was also included. Results: In the TELE group, 100% of children achieved complete disease resolution without readmission, with a median duration of stay of 4 days, significantly shorter than the 7 days in the STAND group (p = 0.01). The telemedicine system demonstrated efficient performance and high satisfaction levels. The NO-TELE group showed no significant differences in demographics or digital technology competence. Perceived benefits of telemedicine included time and cost savings, reduced hospital stays, and technology utility and usability. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that user-friendly mobile medical devices effectively facilitate early hospital discharges in a pediatric setting. These devices serve as a bridge between home and hospital, optimizing care pathways.

KW  - telecommunication
N2  - The adoption of telehealth has soared, and with that the acceptance of Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) and virtual care. A review of the literature illustrates, however, that poor device usability can impact the generated data when using Patient-Generated Health Data (PGHD) devices, such as wearables or home use medical devices, when used outside a health facility. The Pi-CON methodology is introduced to overcome these challenges and guide the definition of user-friendly and intuitive devices in the future. Pi-CON stands for passive, continuous, and non-contact, and describes the ability to acquire health data, such as vital signs, continuously and passively with limited user interaction and without attaching any sensors to the patient. The paper highlights the advantages of Pi-CON by leveraging various sensors and techniques, such as radar, remote photoplethysmography, and infrared. It illustrates potential concerns and discusses future applications Pi-CON could be used for, including gait and fall monitoring by installing an omnipresent sensor based on the Pi-CON methodology. This would allow automatic data collection once a person is recognized, and could be extended with an integrated gateway so multiple cameras could be installed to enable data feeds to a cloud-based interface, allowing clinicians and family members to monitor patient health status remotely at any time.

N2  - Introduction: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an increasingly prevalent chronic, autoimmune, and inflammatory central nervous system illness, whose common symptoms undermine the quality of life of patients and their families. Recent technical breakthroughs potentially offer continuous, reliable, sensitive, and objective remote monitoring solutions for healthcare. Wearables can be useful for evaluating falls, fatigue, sedentary behavior, exercise, and sleep quality in people with MS (PwMS). Objective: This scoping review of relevant literature explores studies investigating the perceptions of patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs) about the use of wearable technologies in the management of MS. Methods: The Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for scoping reviews was used. The search strategy was applied to the databases, MEDLINE via Ovid, Embase, APA PsycInfo, and CINAHL. Further searches were performed in IEEE, Scopus, and Web of Science. The review considered studies reporting quantitative or qualitative data on perceptions and experiences of PwMS and HCPs concerning wearables’ usability, satisfaction, barriers, and facilitators. Results: 10 studies were included in this review. Wearables’ usefulness and accessibility, ease of use, awareness, and motivational tool potential were patient-perceived facilitators of use. Barriers related to anxiety and frustration, complexity, and the design of wearables. Perceived usefulness and system requirements are identified as facilitators of using wearables by HCPs, while data security concerns and fears of increased workload and limited effectiveness in the care plan are identified as barriers to use wearables. Conclusions: This review contributes to our understanding of the benefits of wearable technologies in MS by exploring perceptions of both PwMS and HCPs. The scoping review provided a broad overview of facilitators and barriers to wearable use in MS. There is a need for further studies underlined with sound theoretical frameworks to provide a robust evidence-base for the optimal use of wearables to empower healthcare users and providers.

N2  - Background: Malnutrition is a common and distressing condition among pancreatic cancer patients. Fewer than a quarter of pancreatic cancer patients receive medical nutrition therapy (MNT), important for improving nutritional status, weight maintenance, quality of life and survival. System, provider, and patient level barriers limit access to MNT. We propose to examine the feasibility of a 12-week multi-level, digital health intervention designed to expand MNT access among pancreatic cancer patients. Methods: Individuals with advanced pancreatic cancer starting chemotherapy (N = 80) will be 1:1 randomized to the intervention or usual care. The Support Through Remote Observation and Nutrition Guidance (STRONG) intervention includes system-level (e.g., routine malnutrition and screening), provider-level (e.g., dietitian training and web-based dashboard), and patient-level strategies (e.g., individualized nutrition plan, self-monitoring of dietary intake via Fitbit, ongoing goal monitoring and feedback). Individuals receiving usual care will be referred to dietitians based on their oncologists’ discretion. Study assessments will be completed at baseline, 4-, 8-, 12-, and 16-weeks. Results: Primary outcomes will be feasibility (e.g., recruitment, retention, assessment completion) and acceptability. We will collect additional implementation outcomes, such as intervention adherence, perceived usability, and feedback on intervention quality via an exit interview. We will collect preliminary data on outcomes that may be associated with the intervention including malnutrition, quality of life, treatment outcomes, and survival. Conclusion: This study will advance our knowledge on the feasibility of a digital health intervention to reduce malnutrition among individuals with advanced pancreatic cancer. Trial registration: NCT05675059, registered on December 9, 2022.

N2  - Research Objectives: Evaluate the safety, feasibility, and usability of integrating a tele-exercise intervention with remote monitoring systems in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). Design: The safety, feasibility, and usability of an integrated tele-exercise and remote monitoring program in people with MS (PwMS) was evaluated by deploying a before-after intervention study design. Setting: The intervention was deployed in the general community and outcomes were collected in a hospital setting. Participants: Eight female and three male participants with MS (51.2±8.6 years of age) with a PDDS of 1-6 (3.1±1.6) were included in the study. Interventions: Participants completed a 6-week tele-exercise program delivered through an online video streaming platform called Burnalong. Main Outcome Measures: Safety was evaluated by assessing the number of falls and adverse events as well as changes in mobility (6 minute walk test) and trait fatigue (modified fatigue impact scale). Feasibility was evaluated by quantifying the adherence to tele-exercise and remote monitoring activities. Remote monitoring activities included wearing a Fitbit smart watch and responding to daily surveys deployed through a mobile application (MyCap). Results: Participants did not report any adverse events or falls and did not experience any significant reductions in mobility or increases in fatigue. On average, participants were 59.8%±13.4 adherent to assigned exercises, 77.0%±11.6 adherent to wearing a smart watch, and 59.9%±9.7 adherent to taking surveys. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the preliminary safety and feasibility integrating tele-exercise delivered through an online platform with state-of-the-art remote monitoring systems. Integrating tele-exercise interventions with measurements derived from remote monitoring systems may provide novel insight regarding the impact of tele-exercise. Author(s) Disclosures: None.

N2  - The Swiss Primary Hypersomnolence and Narcolepsy Cohort Study (SPHYNCS) is a multicenter research initiative to identify new biomarkers in central disorders of hypersomnolence (CDH). Whereas narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) is well characterized, other CDH disorders lack precise biomarkers. In SPHYNCS, we utilized Fitbit smartwatches to monitor physical activity, heart rate, and sleep parameters over one year. We examined the feasibility of long-term ambulatory monitoring using the wearable device. We then explored digital biomarkers differentiating patients with NT1 from healthy controls (HC). A total of 115 participants received a Fitbit smartwatch. Using a compliance metric to evaluate the usability of the wearable device, we found an overall compliance rate of 80% over one year. We calculated daily physical activity, heart rate, and sleep parameters from two weeks of greatest compliance to compare NT1 (n=20) and HC (n=9) subjects. Compared to controls, NT1 patients demonstrated findings consistent with increased sleep fragmentation, including significantly greater wake-after-sleep onset (p=0.007) and awakening index (p=0.025), as well as standard deviation of time in bed (p=0.044). Moreover, NT1 patients exhibited a significantly shorter REM latency (p=0.019), and sleep latency (p=0.001), as well as a lower peak heart rate (p=0.008), heart rate standard deviation (p=0.039) and high-intensity activity (p=0.009) compared to HC. This ongoing study demonstrates the feasibility of long-term monitoring with wearable technology in patients with CDH and potentially identifies a digital biomarker profile for NT1. While further validation is needed in larger datasets, these data suggest that long-term wearable technology may play a future role in diagnosing and managing narcolepsy.

KW  - randomized controlled trial (topic)
N2  - BACKGROUND: Perioperative telemonitoring of patients undergoing major surgery might lead to improved postoperative outcomes. The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the effectiveness of current perioperative telemonitoring interventions on postoperative clinical, patient-reported, and financial outcome measures in patients undergoing major surgery. METHODS: For this systematic review, PubMed, CINAHL, and Embase databases were searched for eligible articles published between January 1, 2009 and March 15, 2021. Studies were eligible as they described: (P) patients aged 18 years or older who underwent major abdominal surgery, (I) perioperative telemonitoring as intervention, (C) a control group receiving usual care, (O) any type of postoperative clinical, patient-reported, or financial outcome measures, and (S) an interventional study design. RESULTS: The search identified 2958 articles of which 10 were eligible for analysis, describing nine controlled trials of 2438 patients. Perioperative telemonitoring comprised wearable biosensors (n = 3), websites (n = 3), e-mail (n = 1), and mobile applications (n = 2). Outcome measures were clinical (n = 8), patient-reported (n = 5), and financial (n = 2). Results show significant improvement of recovery time, stoma self-efficacy and pain in the early postoperative phase in patients receiving telemonitoring. Other outcome measures were not significantly different between the groups. CONCLUSION: Evidence for the effectiveness of perioperative telemonitoring in major surgery is scarce. There is a need for good quality studies with sufficient patients while ensuring that the quality and usability of the technology and the adoption in care processes are optimal.

N2  - Background: Ventricular assist devices (VADs) are effective therapy for patients with end-stage heart failure. Current VAD controllers offer improved interactivity, yet limitations of the visual, tactile, and auditory interface persist that impact patient experience and quality of life (QoL). This study explores how VAD controllers can be redesigned using a human-centered design approach to enhance the emotional and functional experience of the device for patients. Methods: VAD patients (n = 21), caregivers (n = 4) and healthcare practitioners (n = 24) were interviewed to uncover design opportunities. From this, a series of realistic scenarios to design for emerged. A “design by analogy” method took inspiration from existing consumer products to ideate new functionality for the VAD wearable system, creating concepts for a controller interface and paired wearable device. An additional 15 patients and 2 caregivers were engaged to explore current VAD controller experiences and evaluate the future-state concepts. Results: This research validated the need for increased automation and emergency functionality in VAD controllers, including remote monitoring of data, accurate communication of battery status, and automated medical alerts for critical device alarms. “Manage my health,” “Feeling normal,” “Social belonging,” “Feeling safe,” and “Sense of control” emerged as key patient concerns to be met by future VAD controller designs. Conclusions: The study demonstrated an innovative and relevant approach to improve usability of future VAD peripherals. By considering both emotional and functional perspectives in the design of lifesaving medical devices such as VADs, device manufacturers can uncover new opportunities to improve patient QoL through improved user experiences.

N2  - Background: Remote monitoring systems have the potential to measure symptoms and treatment effects in people with Parkinson's disease (PwP) in the home environment. However, information about user experience and long-term compliance of such systems in a large group of PwP with relatively severe PD symptoms is lacking. Objective: The aim was to gain insight into user experience and long-term compliance of a smartwatch (to be worn 24/7) and an online dashboard to report falls and receive feedback of data. Methods: We analyzed the data of the “Bringing Parkinson Care Back Home” study, a 1-year observational cohort study in 200 PwP with a fall history. User experience, compliance, and reasons for noncompliance were described. Multiple Cox regression models were used to identify determinants of 1-year compliance. Results: We included 200 PwP (mean age: 69 years, 37% women), of whom 116 (58%) completed the 1-year study. The main reasons for dropping out of the study were technical problems (61 of 118 reasons). Median wear time of the smartwatch was 17.5 h/day. The online dashboard was used by 77% of participants to report falls. Smartphone possession, shorter disease duration, more severe motor symptoms, and less-severe freezing and balance problems, but not age and gender, were associated with a higher likelihood of 1-year compliance. Conclusions: The 1-year compliance with this specific smartwatch was moderate, and the user experience was generally good, except battery life and data transfer. Future studies can build on these findings by incorporating a smartwatch that is less prone to technical issues.

N2  - Background: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are common in affected individuals and can be challenging for (in)formal caregivers. Therefore, they are also referred to as challenging behaviors (CBs). Sensor technology measuring context and behavior can be assistive to effectively manage CBs in an objective fashion. Sensors can help support healthcare professionals, such as nurses, by enabling remote monitoring and alarming on early-stage behavioral changes associated with CBs. This might/ will improve the quality of life (QoL) for both caregivers and clients living in a nursing homes (NH). In the project “MOnitoring Onbegrepen Gedrag bij Dementie met sensortechnologie” (MOOD-Sense), we aim to develop such a monitoring system. Our research focuses on two questions 1) How to develop and implement a monitoring system within the context of nursing homes with parameters on environment, physiology, and behavior, identify and process relevant precursors of challenging behavior with this monitoring system and 2) gain insight in which behaviors are challenging according to nurses and how they are described. This will be represented in an ontology such that sensor data can be translated into the same conceptual information. Methods: The first research question will be examined with a set of experiments in the field (in NH) with an iterative approach. Insights from previous experiments on usability and added value of sensors will be used to improve successive experiments. During each experiment, multiple participants (clients with dementia and CBs) are monitored with both ambient and wearable sensors. For the second research question a qualitative approach is employed, using focus groups (FG) and consensus methods. These FGs will be held amongst nursing staff who are involved in daily care tasks for people with dementia. Subsequently, consensus methods are used to align behavioral descriptors/labels. Results: early findings will be presented at the symposium Discussion: Within this project we expect to find precursors of challenging behavior in a personalized fashion based on nurse's expert knowledge and sensor data. In order to develop a monitoring system that can be embedded within NH's, real-time alarming, in-situ behavior recognition and trustworthiness are part of our technological requirements. Just-intime interventions may then be deployed to prevent behavior escalation or the persistence of undesirable situations.

N2  - Introduction. More than half of patients with cancer who receive cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or immunotherapies experience deleterious side effects such as febrile neutropenia, infection, neurotoxicity, and cytokine release syndrome. Early intervention and treatment for these side effects can help avoid complications and improve outcomes, but delays in treatment administration are common as most outpatient management approaches depend on patient self-assessment and patient-initiated pursuit of follow-up care. Remote patient monitoring through digital health technologies offers the opportunity to bridge this gap without imposing undue burden on either patients or healthcare providers. This feasibility study assessed the results of a technology-assisted in-home oncology care program to remotely monitor bone marrow transplant and CAR T-cell therapy patients and provide early intervention for symptomatic episodes needing clinical management. The program also offered support for patients to obtain routine lab draws, hydration, antiemetics, intravenous antibiotics, and a provider assessment at home. Technical and operational feasibility were evaluated together with perceived user experience among patients, caregivers, and providers. Methods. Ten patients between 18-89 years old participated in the study for up to 90 days following allogeneic bone marrow transplant and up to 30 days following CAR T-cell therapy or autologous bone marrow transplant. Patients used continuous-wear biometric sensors for passive vital sign monitoring around the clock seven days per week and engaged with a chatbot by SMS text for health status checks and symptom reporting. Scheduled home care was administered by licensed home health providers. Virtual care center personnel evaluated patient status based on wearable data and patient messaging and followed up directly with patients or engaged patients' treating clinicians for notification and management of urgent issues as needed. Patients and caregivers were asked to complete surveys about their experience with and perceptions of the program at midpoint and study completion, while providers were asked to complete end-of-study surveys to capture their perspectives across all patients. Patients were also asked to participate in brief interviews at study midpoint and at the end of the study. Interim Results. Eighty percent of patients participated in the program as intended through wearing devices and responding to engagement prompts. Wearable sensors detected a total of 184 outpatient alerts from patients between April and July 2023, of which 57 led to follow up with patients, 12 required further follow up with the clinical care team, and 5 required follow up care in a clinical setting due to elevated temperature or respiratory rate. Sixty percent of patients responded more than 50% of the time to requested health assessment surveys. Patient engagement with the chatbot and symptom reporting system led to 48 events needing virtual care team follow up, of which 20 were to answer patient questions and 28 were in response to reports of concerning symptoms. A total of 11 events were further referred by the virtual care team to the clinical care team, of which 5 required follow up care in a clinical setting. Study data collection will complete in August 2023. Initial Conclusions. Technology-assisted remote patient monitoring is feasible for use with bone marrow transplant and CAR T-cell therapy patients at home. Successful integration with clinical practice settings requires tailoring to existing workflows. Further assessment of patient acceptance for short-term versus long-term monitoring is recommended.

N2  - Introduction: Continuous and non-invasive monitoring of health through digital devices is promising in multiple sclerosis (MS) to early detect relevant changes (e.g., relapses) and consequently anticipate tailored interventions. Objectives/Aims: Aim of this pilot study within the H2020 project ALAMEDA-Bridging the Early Diagnosis and Treatment Gaps of Brain Diseases was to develop an integrated platform collecting patient-centred data from wearables and mobile devices through digital patient-reported outcomes (ePRO) and to test the toolkit's feasibility and usability in people with MS (PwMS). Methods: Data collection has been defined according to MULTIACT shared decisions model involving all relevant stakeholders in the selection of outcomes. These included physical parameters continuously recorded by a smartwatch; ePRO on mobility, cognitive functions, emotional status, daily life and sleep quality periodically administered to users through a smartphone App. Pseudonymised data were stored on the cloud and made accessible to healthcare professionals and researchers using a dashboard. The percentage of completed over scheduled ePRO was calculated as a feasibility outcome. Usability of the toolkit was measured with the System Usability Scale (SUS). Results: 20 PwMS (14 females; age=37.8±6.0 years; all relapsingremitting MS; disease duration=9.1±6.8 years; EDSS=2.2±1.3) were included and asked to use the ALAMEDA toolkit for one year. Half of them reached the 6-month milestone. Users correctly completed 53% of the scheduled ePRO and regularly wore the smartwatch without discomfort. Values of generated data are in line with those reported by the literature (Daily steps=8415±3028; daily minutes of vigorous / moderate / light activity=9.8±9.4 / 14.5±11.7 / 268.7±68.9; daily sedentary minutes=705.1±117.6; Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale-12=37.2±15.7; Arm function in Multiple Sclerosis Questionnaire=47.4±20.4; Perceived Deficit Questionnaire= 25.2±16.4; Beck Anxiety Inventory=17.3±16.0; Modified Fatigue Impact Scale=18.5±14.5; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index=25.2±16.4). SUS revealed high levels of confidence using the system and very high intention to use it in the future. Conclusion: The ALAMEDA toolkit seems feasible and usable to remotely monitor multiple domains of health status in PwMS. Further analysis on the dataset, including Artificial Intelligence and machine learning algorithms, may allow predicting relevant changes throughout the course of MS and anticipating the therapeutic intervention.

N2  - Introduction: Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD) is characterised by severe and unpredictable relapses, from which recovery is generally incomplete. Remote monitoring could help inform patient symptomatology, raise evidence on disease burden and support treatment decisions by clinicians. NMOSDCopilot, a Software as a Medical Device (SaMD), was developed to answer these needs. It includes a mobile application intended to be used at home by patients, composed of active tests (to self-assess motor, cognitive, vision, dexterity functions) and e-questionnaires. A web portal is available for clinicians to access patient results. In line with the guidelines for the development of SaMD, user involvement during development is critical, which is why NMOSDCopilot was designed in collaboration with patients and clinicians. Usability engineering techniques were used to identify and mitigate factors that could contribute to human errors and adverse events. Objectives/Aims: To demonstrate the compliance of the NMOSDCopilot patient interface, two usability studies were conducted with NMOSD patients. Methods: Two usability remote studies were conducted among French patients: a user improvement (formative study; N=5) followed by a user validation study (summative study; N=12). All patients were recruited through a patient advocacy group in France. During the formative study, patients tested prototypes with 4 e-active tests (Cognition, Dexterity, Endurance, Perimeter). User behaviour, perceived ease of use, readability and satisfaction were collected and evaluated on a 7-point Likert scale. During the summative study, patients used NMOSDCopilot active tests and quality of life e-questionnaires (Pain Visual Analogue Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire-8). Success rate and perceived ease of use were analysed. Results: The formative study showed that the active tests were perceived as very easy (mean=6.7/7, SD=0.35) and satisfying to use (mean=6.7/7, SD=0.20). The cognition test was perceived as being readable (mean=6.6/7, SD=0.89). The identified areas of improvement were addressed during NMOSDCopilot development. Except for the Vision test, the summative study showed that NMOSDCopilot was perceived as being very easy to use, with a success rate of use of 100% for all the tested features. Conclusion: Overall, NMOSDCopilot patient interface was validated among French patients and will also be tested by American patients. Its clinical performance will be validated in OPTIS, a prospective multicenter clinical study.

N2  - Introduction: Over the last years, digital health tools have found their way into research and clinical trials in the field of multiple sclerosis (MS). While many healthcare professionals (HCPs) in the field agree that digital tools can standardize and improve MS care, adoption in the clinical routine has proven to be challenging. Objectives/Aims: Therefore, it is key to understand the value digital tools bring to care teams and the potential hurdles for the widespread adoption of these innovative solutions. Methods: We report on the clinical adoption of icompanion, a digital medical device solution that combines remote clinical monitoring with MRI insights. We share lessons learned and describe the efforts to improve patient retention, clinical visit efficiency, fit into clinical workflow, and data representation for care teams. In addition, we report insights from user interviews with HCPs and results from design validation tests for the novel icompanion HCP portal (including System Usability Scale). Results: icompanion is currently being used in 18 hospitals in 6 countries, and used by over 5700 people with MS. Average 3-month retention of patients (using icompanion without their care team) is 58%. Design validation for the novel HCP portal is underway and will be reported from 10-15 HCPs. The user interviews with 13 HCPs suggested that the most crucial factors for clinical adoption were (1) integration into electronic medical records (EMRs) (2) improving clinical visit efficiency (3) helping patients be better prepared for a visit (4) having an instant overview of clinical and MRI biomarkers from patients. Conclusion: Based on this data, the integration of digital health solutions in the clinical workflow (and EMR) is the most important driver for clinical adoption. Most HCPs see a clear value in access to remote monitoring data for patient management, but it is crucial that these solutions improve workflows as well.

N2  - Traditional trial designs have well-recognized inefficiencies and logistical barriers to participation. Decentralized trials and digital health solutions have been suggested as potential solutions and have certainly risen to the challenge during the pandemic. Clinical trial designs are now increasingly data driven. The use of distributed clinical data networks and digitization has helped to fundamentally upgrade existing research systems. A trial design may vary anywhere from fully decentralized to hybrid to traditional on-site. Various decentralization components are available for stakeholders to increase the reach and pace of their trials, such as electronic informed consent, remote interviews, administration, outcome assessment, monitoring, and laboratory and imaging modalities. Furthermore, digital health technologies can be included to enrich study conduct. However, careful consideration is warranted, including assessing verification and validity through usability studies and having various contingencies in place through dedicated risk assessment. Selecting the right combination depends not just on the ability to handle patient care and the medical know-how but also on the availability of appropriate technologic infrastructure, skills, and human resources. Throughout this process, quality of evidence generation and physician-patient relation must not be undermined. Here we also address some knowledge gaps, cost considerations, and potential impact of decentralization and digitization on inclusivity, recruitment, engagement, and retention. Last, we mention some future directions that may help drive the necessary change in the right direction.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Smartphones are often equipped with inertial sensors that measure individuals' physical activity (PA). However, their role in remote monitoring of the patients' PAs in telemedicine needs to be adequately explored. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the correlation between a participant's actual daily step counts and the daily step counts reported by their smartphone. In addition, we inquired about the usability of smartphones for collecting PA data. METHODS: This prospective observational study was conducted among patients undergoing lower limb orthopedic surgery and a group of nonpatients as control. The data from the patients were collected from 2 weeks before surgery until 4 weeks after the surgery, whereas the data collection period for the nonpatients was 2 weeks. The participant's daily step count was recorded by PA trackers worn 24/7. In addition, a smartphone app collected the number of daily steps registered by the participants' smartphones. We compared the cross-correlation between the daily steps time series obtained from the smartphones and PA trackers in different groups of participants. We also used mixed modeling to estimate the total number of steps, using smartphone step counts and the characteristics of the patients as independent variables. The System Usability Scale was used to evaluate the participants' experience with the smartphone app and the PA tracker. RESULTS: Overall, 1067 days of data were collected from 21 patients (n=11, 52% female patients) and 10 nonpatients (n=6, 60% female patients). The median cross-correlation coefficient on the same day was 0.70 (IQR 0.53-0.83). The correlation in the nonpatient group was slightly higher than that in the patient group (median 0.74, IQR 0.60-0.90 and median 0.69, IQR 0.52-0.81, respectively). The likelihood ratio tests on the models fitted by mixed effects methods demonstrated that the smartphone step count was positively correlated with the PA tracker's total number of steps (χ21=34.7, P<.001). In addition, the median usability score for the smartphone app was 78 (IQR 73-88) compared with median 73 (IQR 68-80) for the PA tracker. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the ubiquity, convenience, and practicality of smartphones, the high correlation between the smartphones and the total daily step count time series highlights the potential usefulness of smartphones in detecting changes in the number of steps in remote monitoring of a patient's PA.

N2  - Remote patient monitoring (RPM) is an innovative strategy to promote health and improve patient management and care. Recent advances in healthcare technologies have seen the emergence of wearable sensors allowing longitudinal physiological measurements in any environment. This paper introduces a wireless wearable patch 'Leo' for continuous remote monitoring of physiological data at home and healthcare settings. This includes single lead ECG, chest impedance, heart rate (HR), respiration rate (RR) and body posture. To test Leo's ability to capture longitudinal physiological data at home, 15 children experiencing acute severe asthma exacerbations were recruited during their emergency department (ED) visits. Participants wore the Leo device for 7 (+/-2) days post-hospital discharge. Nocturnal RR and HR and variability were higher during the first half of the night on Day1 compared to Day7 (p<0.005). Participants also completed a usability questionnaire and reported the patch wear to be comfortable (average score of 3.3 out of 5) and easy to wear during the night (average score of 3.5 out of 5) with 5/15 (33%) reported very slight barely perceptible skin irritation/redness and 2 (13%) reported well defined skin irritation and redness.Clinical Relevance- These results highlight the potential use of the Leo device in clinical practice for continuous un-obstructive monitoring of diseased populations, such as asthma.

N2  - Aims: In heart failure (HF), implantable haemodynamic monitoring devices have been shown to optimize therapy, anticipating clinical decompensation and preventing hospitalization. Direct left-sided haemodynamic sensors offer theoretical benefits beyond pulmonary artery pressure monitoring systems. We evaluated the safety, usability, and performance of a novel left atrial pressure (LAP) monitoring system in HF patients. Methods and results: The VECTOR-HF study (NCT03775161) was a first-in-human, prospective, multicentre, single-arm, clinical trial enrolling 30 patients with HF. The device consisted of an interatrial positioned leadless sensor, able to transmit LAP data wirelessly. After 3 months, a right heart catheterization was performed to correlate mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) with simultaneous mean LAP obtained from the device. Remote LAP measurements were then used to guide patient management. The miniaturized device was successfully implanted in all 30 patients, without acute major adverse cardiac and neurological events (MACNE). At 3 months, freedom from short-term MACNE was 97%. Agreement between sensor-calculated LAP and PCWP was consistent, with a mean difference of −0.22 ± 4.92 mmHg, the correlation coefficient and the Lin's concordance correlation coefficient values were equal to 0.79 (p < 0.0001) and 0.776 (95% confidence interval 0.582–0.886), respectively. Preliminary experience with V-LAP-based HF management was associated with significant improvements in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class (32% of patients reached NYHA class II at 6 months, p < 0.005; 60% of patients at 12 months, p < 0.005) and 6-min walk test distance (from 244.59 ± 119.59 m at baseline to 311.78 ± 129.88 m after 6 months, p < 0.05, and 343.95 ± 146.15 m after 12 months, p < 0.05). Conclusion: The V-LAP™ monitoring system proved to be generally safe and provided a good correlation with invasive PCWP. Initial evidence also suggests possible improvement in HF clinical symptoms.

N2  - Introduction: Pain patients are increasingly asked to engage daily with smartphone applications and wearable devices for remote monitoring. However, some chronic pain patients are inconsistent with their patterns of wearable device use, charging, and responding to digital surveys. This clinical study examines whether patients will engage more regularly with these digital tools when provided with personalized feedback and targeted messaging regarding pain and common comorbidities via an entertaining user experience. Methods: This is a prospective, longitudinal, dual-arm clinical trial designed to enroll 28 patients into two study arms (14 patients per arm). In the traditional study arm, patients are provided with a remote monitoring smartphone application and wearable physiologic sensors. In the personalized experience study arm, patients are provided with these same tools, but are given a version of the remote monitoring app that provides a simple personalized user experience including engaging dialog, stories, targeted education related to chronic pain, and feedback on their health and holistic well-being. Patient engagement is measured by the consistency with which patients engage with the application, respond to therapy-related surveys, and use their wearable device properly. The interim analysis included in this report consists of the available survey data from five initial subjects in the traditional study arm before and during the SCS trial period. Enrollment of the first patient in the personalized experience arm occurred in July 2022 and follow-up and analysis are ongoing. Results: Three of five interviewed subjects wanted to be able to view their wearable data daily, while the other two subjects preferred to view them weekly. Subjects preferred using the Oura™ Ring and Apple Watch® due to their comfort and ease of use. Subjects also preferred the weekly recharging of the Oura ring (vs. daily watch charging). Conclusions: This research seeks to demonstrate feasibility for using patient-centric app design and artificial intelligence to improve user engagement with digital therapies in the field of chronic pain. We hypothesize that patients will be more engaged with use of digital tools if they are provided with an engaging and simple user experience that interests them and educates them regarding their chronic pain and related well-being topics. Chronic pain is a multi-dimensional disorder that can impact patient physical, social, and mental well-being [1]. Ongoing research should investigate whether digital education can also be used concurrently with neuromodulation to motivate patients to make positive lifestyle changes that are synergistic with their SCS therapy.

N2  - Background: Initiation of an immuno-modulatory treatment is a vulnerable part of the patient journey. Distance monitoring via patient reported outcomes (PROs) and wearables are used to assess treatment efficacy. In combination with remote vital sign measurement and tele-nursing, remote care may also increase safety and save resources. However, it is unclear how such telemedicine services integrate into the clinical workflow. Objectives: Feasibility and User Experience (UX) study of a combined appbased and nurse-assisted tele-monitoring program in rheumatic patients with different risk profiles starting a new biologic treatment. Methods: In this quantitative and qualitative study, we explored a distance monitoring service including contactless optical vital sign measurement and tele-nursing in ambulatory rheumatic patients in Switzerland. System Usability Scores (SUS) and semi-structured interviews were performed with patients, tele-nurses, and rheumatologists. Patients collected weekly PROs and vital signs via an app (Vtuls, Switzerland) after instruction by tele-nurses. Vital sign deterioration triggered automated notification (categorized in yellow, green, and red) allowing corrective actions. Rheumatologists received monthly summaries of PRO and vital signs in PDF form. Results: 15 patients with rheumatoid arthritis or spondylarthritis with a mean age of 43.9 years (32-79) were included and monitored up to three months with the app and phone calls of the tele-nurse. 15/15 patients found the program useful, mainly for staying in contact with their rheumatologist after therapy start or switch. 13/15 patients measured their vital signs regularly, the adherence to PRO questionnaires was significantly lower. 6 patients had technical problems with the contactless blood pressure measurement. The app generated in average 16 vital sign alarms per patient, of those 7.1 green, 1.1 yellow and 2.2 red alarms. The rheumatologists considered the program as useful, especially in one patient with high-level comorbidity who experienced infection and in another patient after dosing error of the new treatment. The number of consultations (e.g. routine control 1-2 months after starting the new treatment) were significantly lower in this cohort compared to patients without remote care. PDF reports via email were considered as suboptimal and digital integration into the workflow needs to be implemented in future versions of the care program. Tele-nurses considered patients with high comorbidity, shorter disease duration and younger age as most suitable for remote control. False alarms initially increased the workload of the nurses, but this later reduced through technical advice and adjustment of the thresholds. SUS scores were slightly higher in patients (median 97.5) compared to tele-nurses (median 77.5). One patient outlier (17.5) had higher expectations in the responsiveness of tele-nursing, based on entered PROs. Conclusion: Tight remote control of safety and efficacy through a combined app, biosensor and tele-nursing program was appreciated by all stakeholders, especially in patients with high comorbidity. A better integration of data and communication in the clinical workflow is required, ideally through the electronic medical record. A reduced workload in the rheumatology clinic was observed, but a complete reorganization of the processes was necessary.

N2  - Background: Improvements in technology can prompt device changes during clinical studies. ON TRAX [NCT04381494] was a prospective pilot study aimed to evaluate the potential benefit of using a multiparametric remote monitoring system to detect early signs of pneumonitis in patients with Stage III NSCLC receiving standard of care durvalumab post-chemoradiotherapy. Here we report learnings from this pilot based on post-hoc analyses comparing changes in device adherence, study retention and user experience after upgrading the wearable device mid-study. Methods: Patients were monitored remotely while on durvalumab, for up to 1 year, with an FDA-cleared system (Current Health) that recorded vital signs continuously (SpO2, respiratory rate, pulse, temperature and motion). During the study, the wearable was upgraded from Generation One (G1) to Two (G2), a smaller and lighter (30 vs 115 grams) device with same capabilities. We compared daily device adherence (defined as median number of hours with wearable data transmission per 24h expressed as %) and total study participation time (days) for G1 vs G2 users by Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test. At end-of-study visit, some patients rated on a 5-point Likert scale three statements regarding comfort of wearable, intrusiveness, and overall experience. Results: Following IRB approvals, 40 patients from 16 US sites were enrolled, but only 39 patients with minimum of 1h of wearable data transmitted were included in this analysis. Nine patients used only G1, 22 only G2, while 8 used both. Collectively, the 39 patients transmitted 76,957 hours of data. The median (interquartile range) length of participation was 84 (47-208) days. Transitioning from G1 to G2 did not affect daily device adherence (G1: 79 (46-96) vs G2: 75 (58-100) %, p = 0.9), but patients using G2 exclusively participated 34 days longer than those using G1 exclusively (47 (2-57) vs 81 (50-161) days, p = 0.03). Seventeen patients responded to the user experience survey, of which 13 used only one device (G1 = 3, G2 = 10). Ten of 10 (100%) G2 users 'agreed'/'strongly agreed' that the wearable was comfortable, while 2 out of 3 of G1 users 'disagreed'. Both groups 'agreed'/'strongly agreed' it did not impede their daily activities. Overall experience was 'good'/'excellent' for 9 of 10 (90%) G2 users, but varied in G1 users (1 'good', 1 'neutral', 1 'poor'). Conclusions: Following the introduction of a smaller and lighter wearable device, patients remained a median 34 days longer in this digital health pilot study and reported greater comfort and better overall experience, however the pilot was terminated early. In light of technological updates, researchers must balance consistency with data yield and patient experience. An interim review of technology and its implementation into study protocols is recommended.

N2  - Rationale: Recent advances in wearable sensor technologies have shown great potential in capturing real-life objective data at-home that can unlock great insights into clinical conditions change over time. Currently, there is no available wearable sensor to accurately capture pulmonary function remotely in the home, especially in children. 'Leo' is a novel Band-Aid sized wearable patch that uses impedance pneumography to measure respiratory parameters. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and performance of Leo compared to gold standard pneumotachography (PNT) in estimating respiratory rate, volume and flow. Methods: Twenty-six children with stable asthma ages 3-18 years were enrolled. The Leo device was placed over the mid-sternum. Participants breathed through a PNT device (Hans Rudolph, USA) to simultaneously capture respiratory rate, volume and flow while changing tidal volume in sitting, supine and lateral positions. Assessment duration was 10-15 minutes in each position and the measurements were also repeated 15 minutes after albuterol administration. The agreement between respiratory volume and flow waveform was assessed using standard error of the mean (SEM) and for respiratory rate using Pearson correlation coefficient. Participants completed a usability questionnaire. Results: Twenty two of the 26 recruited participants were included in the final respiratory analysis (mean age 10.2±4.3 years; 19 boys). Reasons for exclusion: excessive movement (2) and unable to adequately follow instructions (2). Respiratory rates median 19.7 (range 5-40) breaths/minute (bpm) and tidal volumes median 280 (range 100 - 3500) mL. The agreement of respiratory flow and volume was strong in all body postures and tidal volumes (mean ρ>0.95-0.85). The agreement between the PNT-derived and Leo-derived tidal volume estimates was also strong when Leo values were calibrated per subject and posture (r = 0.96, limits of agreement ± 0.2 Litres). Respiratory rates measured by Leo and PNT were highly correlated. (r = 0.98, limits of agreement ±1.5 breaths per minute). Twenty-two (85%) participants reported “very slight redness” at the skin site after Leo removal, and one reported “well-defined redness”. Otherwise, no other adverse events were reported. Participants reported a mean score of 3.6±0.63 (out of 5) for comfort (5 being very comfortable). Conclusions: These results suggest that Leo is a highly accurate and safe wearable sensor for respiratory monitoring in children with asthma. Further studies are needed to evaluate the clinical utility of Leo as a remote monitoring tool to assess pulmonary function.

N2  - Background and Aim Statement: Smartwatches are increasingly accurate at detecting vital signs, are inexpensive and easy to operate, and hold promise as tools for remote patient monitoring (RPM). The COVID pandemic has highlighted the potential safety benefits of post-discharge RPM in the ED, especially in remote/rural settings. This study aimed to determine the feasibility characteristics of smartwatches in health status tracking for post-COVID patients. Measures and Design: This prospective feasibility trial enrolled patients rehabilitating at home from acute COVID in remote/rural Alberta. Patients were asked to wear a Fitbit Charge 2 device continuously and device metrics were extracted for analysis (e.g. heart rate, sleep, and activity). Electronic patient reported outcome measures (e-PROMS) for mental (bi-weekly) and physical (daily) health were collected via SMS text and email. Exit surveys and semistructured interviews evaluated the patient experience. The primary outcome was proportion of time (study-hours) with usable heart rate data. Secondary measures included completion rate for e-PROMs, patient satisfaction, patient-perceived clinical utility and mental health impacts. Evaluation/results: Of 17 eligible patients, 11 agreed to participate. The mean age was 52 yrs and 73% were female. Five patients (45%) were hospitalized (avg. stay 41 days) and 4 required mechanical ventilation; 6 already owned a smartwatch. The most prominent physical symptoms were fatigue, muscle weakness, headache, and dyspnea. On average, patients had moderate to severe anxiety (GAD 7 = 15.8), depression (PHQ-9 = 19.9), and stress (PSS = 26.6). A total of 21,040 patient-hours were monitored, averaging 1913 hrs per patient (SD = 1396). Heart rate data was usable for 83% of studyhours. Surveys were completed 83% and 72% of the time for mental and physical health, respectively. Survey scores were favorable for usability/acceptability (3.9/7), perceived clinical utility (3.5/7) and mental health impacts (3.8/7). Interviews revealed overall positive patient experience with varying concerns about data privacy/security. Discussion/impact: Smartwatches are feasible tools for RPM, especially given their usability, affordability, and patient acceptance. We will present preliminary estimates for longitudinal associations between smartwatch parameters and e-PROMS. Future work will aim to develop tools for predicting and preventing ED visits/revisits with continuously collected smartwatch data and machine learning.

N2  - Developing a sensor that can read out cross-talk free signals while determining various active physiological parameters is demanding in the field of point-of-care applications. While there are a few examples of non-flexible sensors available, the management of electronic waste generated from such sensors is critical. Most of such available sensors are rigid in form factor and hence limit their usability in healthcare monitoring due to their poor conformity to human skin. Combining these facets, studies on the development of a recyclable cross-talk free flexible sensor for monitoring human motions and active parameters are far and few. In this work, we report on the development of a recyclable flexible sensor that can provide accurate data for detecting small changes in strain as well as pressure. The developed sensor could decipher the signals individually responsible due to strain as well as pressure. Hence, it can deliver a cross-talk free output. Thermoplastic polyurethane and graphene were selected as the model system. The thermoplastic polyurethane/graphene sensor exhibited a tensile strain sensitivity of GF ≃ 3.375 for 0-100% strain and 10.551 for 100-150% strain and a pressure sensitivity of ∼-0.25 kPa-1. We demonstrate the applicability of the strain sensor for monitoring a variety of human motions ranging from a very small strain of eye blinking to a large strain of elbow bending with unambiguous peaks and a very fast response and recovery time of 165 ms. The signals received are mostly electrical hysteresis free. To confirm the recyclability, the developed sensor was recycled up to three times. Marginal decrement in the sensitivity was noted with recycling without compromising the sensing capabilities. These findings promise to open up a new avenue for developing flexible sensors with lesser carbon footprints.

N2  - Background and Objectives: Remote patient monitoring (RPM) of vital signs and symptoms for lung transplant recipients (LTRs) has become increasingly relevant in many situations. Nevertheless, RPM research integrating multisensory home monitoring in LTRs is scarce. We developed a novel multisensory home monitoring device and tested it in the context of COVID-19 vaccinations. We hypothesize that multisensory RPM and smartphone-based questionnaire feedback on signs and symptoms will be well accepted among LTRs. To assess the usability and acceptability of a remote monitoring system consisting of wearable devices, including home spirometry and a smartphone-based questionnaire application for symptom and vital sign monitoring using wearable devices, during the first and second SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Materials and Methods: Observational usability pilot study for six weeks of home monitoring with the COVIDA Desk for LTRs. During the first week after the vaccination, intensive monitoring was performed by recording data on physical activity, spirometry, temperature, pulse oximetry and self-reported symptoms, signs and additional measurements. During the subsequent days, the number of monitoring assessments was reduced. LTRs reported on their perceptions of the usability of the monitoring device through a purpose-designed questionnaire. Results: Ten LTRs planning to receive the first COVID-19 vaccinations were recruited. For the intensive monitoring study phase, LTRs recorded symptoms, signs and additional measurements. The most frequent adverse events reported were local pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance and headache. The duration of these symptoms was 5-8 days post-vaccination. Adherence to the main monitoring devices was high. LTRs rated usability as high. The majority were willing to continue monitoring. Conclusions: The COVIDA Desk showed favorable technical performance and was well accepted by the LTRs during the vaccination phase of the pandemic. The feasibility of the RPM system deployment was proven by the rapid recruitment uptake, technical performance (i.e., low number of errors), favorable user experience questionnaires and detailed individual user feedback.

N2  - Small-scale and high-performance energy storage devices have drawn tremendous attention with their portable, lightweight, and multi-functionalized features. Here, we present a foldable supercapacitor with affordable flexibility by adopting a developed design and electrode material system as a way to extend usability. Notably, to resolve the limited energy density of conventional capacitors, we successfully synthesize the CoO/NiCo-layered double hydroxide (LDH) core–shell nanostructure on Ni framework as a cathode material. Further, glucose-based activated carbon (GBAC) is utilized for the anode. The CoO/NiCo-LDH electrodes exhibited a high specific capacitance of ∼284.8 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1, and GBAC delivers a high specific capacitance of ∼166 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. In the following, the combinatorial integration of these materials enabled the asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) to increase the energy density by enhancing the capacitance and the voltage window, in which a hydrogel-based electrolyte was facilitated for the foldable and wearable capability. The energy density of the ASC device was ∼24.9 Wh kg−1 at a power density of ∼779.5 W kg−1 with a voltage window of ∼1.6 V. As demonstrated, a self-powered energy source was demonstrated by a serially connected multi-ASC device with a help of a commercial solar cell, which was employed for powering wearable healthcare monitoring devices, including personal alarms for patients and recording the human body's electrical signals. The present work offers a viable approach to preparing potential candidates for high-performance electrodes of supercapacitors with deformable configurations to extend the powering capability of other electronic devices with physical functionalities used in wearable electronics.

N2  - BACKGROUND: With the increase in concern for deaths and illness related to the increase in temperature globally, there is a growing need for real-time monitoring of workers for heat stress indicators. The purpose of this study was to determine the usability of the Slate Safety (SS) wearable physiological monitoring system. METHODS: Twenty nurses performed a common task in a moderate or hot environment while wearing the SS device, the Polar 10 monitor, and having taken the e-Celsius ingestible pill. Data from each device was compared for correlation and accuracy. RESULTS: High correlation was determined between the SS wearable device and the Polar 10 system (0.926) and the ingestible pill (0.595). The SS was comfortable to wear and easily monitored multiple participants from a distance. CONCLUSIONS: The Slate Safety wearable device demonstrated accuracy in measuring core temperature and heart rate while not restricting the motion of the worker, and provided a remote monitoring platform for physiological parameters.

N2  - Background: A critical factor in healing diabetic foot ulcers is patient adherence to offloading devices. We tested a smart offloading boot (SmartBoot) combined with a smartwatch app and cloud dashboard to remotely monitor patient adherence and activity. In addition, the impact of SmartBoot on balance, gait, and user experience was investigated. Methods: Fourteen volunteers (31.6±8.7 years; 64% female) performed natural activities (eg, sitting, standing, walking) with and without the SmartBoot for approximately 30 minutes. All participants completed balance tests, 10-meter walking tests at slow, normal, and fast pace while wearing the SmartBoot, and a user experience questionnaire. The accuracy of real-time adherence reporting was assessed by comparing the SmartBoot and staff observation. Center of mass (COM) sway and step counts were measured using a validated wearable system. Results: Average sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for adherence and non-adherence were 90.6%, 88.0%, and 89.3%, respectively. The COM sway area was significantly smaller with the SmartBoot than without the SmartBoot regardless of test condition. Step count error was 4.4% for slow waking, 36.2% for normal walking, 16.0% for fast walking. Most participants agreed that the SmartBoot is easy to use, relatively comfortable, nonintrusive, and innovative. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first smart offloading system that enables remote patient monitoring and real-time adherence and activity reporting. The SmartBoot enhanced balance performance, likely due to somatosensory feedback. Questionnaire results highlight SmartBoot’s technical and clinical potential. Future studies warrant clinical validation of real-time non-adherence alerting to improve wound healing outcomes in people with diabetic foot ulcers.

N2  - Introduction: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder which requires complex medication regimens to mitigate motor symptoms. The use of digital health technology systems (DHTSs) to collect mobility and medication data provides an opportunity to objectively quantify the effect of medication on motor performance during day-to-day activities. This insight could inform clinical decision-making, personalise care, and aid self-management. This study investigates the feasibility and usability of a multi-component DHTS to remotely assess self-reported medication adherence and monitor mobility in people with Parkinson's (PwP). Methods: Thirty participants with PD [Hoehn and Yahr stage I (n = 1) and II (n = 29)] were recruited for this cross-sectional study. Participants were required to wear, and where appropriate, interact with a DHTS (smartwatch, inertial measurement unit, and smartphone) for seven consecutive days to assess medication adherence and monitor digital mobility outcomes and contextual factors. Participants reported their daily motor complications [motor fluctuations and dyskinesias (i.e., involuntary movements)] in a diary. Following the monitoring period, participants completed a questionnaire to gauge the usability of the DHTS. Feasibility was assessed through the percentage of data collected, and usability through analysis of qualitative questionnaire feedback. Results: Adherence to each device exceeded 70% and ranged from 73 to 97%. Overall, the DHTS was well tolerated with 17/30 participants giving a score > 75% [average score for these participants = 89%, from 0 (worst) to 100 (best)] for its usability. Usability of the DHTS was significantly associated with age (ρ = −0.560, BCa 95% CI [−0.791, −0.207]). This study identified means to improve usability of the DHTS by addressing technical and design issues of the smartwatch. Feasibility, usability and acceptability were identified as key themes from PwP qualitative feedback on the DHTS. Conclusion: This study highlighted the feasibility and usability of our integrated DHTS to remotely assess medication adherence and monitor mobility in people with mild-to-moderate Parkinson's disease. Further work is necessary to determine whether this DHTS can be implemented for clinical decision-making to optimise management of PwP.

N2  - Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with a fast increasing prevalence. Several pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions are available to alleviate symptoms. Technology can be used to improve the efficiency, accessibility and feasibility of these treatments. Although many technologies are available, only few are actually implemented in daily clinical practice. Aim: Here, we study the barriers and facilitators, as experienced by patients, caregivers and/or healthcare providers, to successful implement technology for PD management. Methods: We performed a systematic literature search in the PubMed and Embase databases until June 2022. Two independent raters screened the titles, abstracts and full texts on: 1) people with PD; 2) using technology for disease management; 3) qualitative research methods providing patients’, caregivers and/or healthcare providers’ perspective, and; 4) full text available in English or Dutch. Case studies, reviews and conference abstracts were excluded. Results: We found 5420 unique articles of which 34 were included in this study. Five categories were made: cueing (n = 3), exergaming (n = 3), remote monitoring using wearable sensors (n = 10), telerehabilitation (n = 8) and remote consultation (n = 10). The main barriers reported across categories were unfamiliarity with technology, high costs, technical issues and (motor) symptoms hampering the use of some technologies. Facilitators included good usability, experiencing beneficial effects and feeling safe whilst using the technology. Conclusion: Although only few articles presented a qualitative evaluation of technologies, we found some important barriers and facilitators that may help to bridge the gap between the fast developing technological world and actual implementation in day-to-day living with PD.

N2  - Introduction: Objective and continuous monitoring of physical activity over the long-term in the community is perhaps the most important step in the paradigm shift toward evidence-based practice and personalized therapy for successful community integration. With the advancement in technology, physical activity monitors have become the go-to tools for objective and continuous monitoring of everyday physical activity in the community. While these devices are widely used in many patient populations, their use in individuals with acquired brain injury is slowly gaining traction. The first step before using activity monitors in this population is to understand the patient perspective on usability and ease of use of physical activity monitors at different wear locations. However, there are no studies that have looked at the feasibility and patient perspectives on long-term utilization of activity monitors in individuals with acquired brain injury. Methods: This pilot study aims to fill this gap and understand patient-reported aspects of the feasibility of using physical activity monitors for long-term use in community-dwelling individuals with acquired brain injury. Results: This pilot study found that patients with acquired brain injury faced challenges specific to their functional limitations and that the activity monitors worn on the waist or wrist may be better suited in this population. Discussion: The unique wear location-specific challenges faced by individuals with ABI need to be taken into account when selecting wearable activity monitors for long term use in this population.

N2  - Background: Physiotherapy for persons with Parkinson's disease (PwPD) could benefit from objective and continuous tracking of physical activity and falls in daily life. Objectives: We designed a remote monitoring system for this purpose and describe the experiences of PwPD and physiotherapists who used the system in daily clinical practice. Methods: Twenty-one PwPD (15 men) wore a sensor necklace to passively record physical activity and falls for 6 weeks. They also used a smartphone app to self-report daily activities, (near-)falls and medication intake. They discussed those data with their PD-specialized physiotherapist (n = 9) during three regular treatment sessions. User experiences and aspects to be improved were gathered through interviews with PwPD and physiotherapists, resulting in system updates. The system was evaluated in a second pilot with 25 new PwPD (17 men) and eight physiotherapists. Results: We applied thematic analysis to the interview data resulting in two main themes: usability and utility. First, the usability of the system was rated positively, with the necklace being easy to use. However, some PwPD with limited digital literacy or cognitive impairments found the app unclear. Second, the perceived utility of the system varied among PwPD. While many PwPD were motivated to increase their activity level, others were not additionally motivated because they perceived their activity level as high. Physiotherapists appreciated the objective recording of physical activity at home and used the monitoring of falls to enlarge awareness of the importance of falls for PwPD. Based on the interview data of all participants, we drafted three user profiles for PwPD regarding the benefits of remote monitoring for physiotherapy: for profile 1, a monitoring system could act as a flagging dashboard to signal the need for renewed treatment; for profile 2, a monitoring system could be a motivational tool to maintain physical activity; for profile 3, a monitoring system could passively track physical activity and falls at home. Finally, for a subgroup of PwPD the burdens of monitoring will outweigh the benefits. Conclusions: Overall, both PwPD and physiotherapists underline the potential of a remote monitoring system to support physiotherapy by targeting physical activity and (near-)falls. Our findings emphasize the importance of personalization in remote monitoring technology, as illustrated by our user profiles.

N2  - Background: During the 30-day period prior to initiating dialysis, there is a 10-fold rise in emergency department visits and hospitalizations related to kidney failure. Objective: The Virtual Ward Incorporating Electronic Wearables (VIEWER) trial implemented a home telemonitoring system to track changes in patients’ vitals and assess their adherence and the acceptability of telemonitoring in a chronic kidney disease (CKD) population. Design: A pilot prospective clinical trial using a mixed methods approach was performed. Setting: The research was conducted in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Participants: There were 2 phases: Phase 1 was a 2-week-long pilot trial consisting of 10 participants. Phase 2 was a 3-month-long trial with a total of 26 participants. Patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate <15 and a >40% risk of beginning dialysis in the next 2 years according to the kidney failure risk equation were eligible to participate in the study. Methods: The primary quantitative outcome was adherence, defined as the proportion of daily self-assessments completed using VIEWER over the follow-up period. The usability and acceptability of VIEWER was assessed qualitatively at the end of the trial through structured questionnaires and focus groups. Results: Phase 1 participants (n = 10) had a median adherence of 77.17% for the 2-week observation period. Phase 2 participants (n = 26) showed a lower median adherence of 36% for the 3-month period. Focus group participants (n = 11) identified many positive aspects of VIEWER, including increased awareness and empowerment over health, simplicity of the data platform, and the ability to show clinical staff their health trends. Some challenges identified with VIEWER were connectivity issues with the Bluetooth, perceived inconvenience, and negative thoughts toward their health Limitations: Limitations of the study include a small sample size, which limited our ability to measure quantitative outcomes. In addition, patients agreeing to participate in any trial are generally more highly motivated and engaged in their care than those declining participation. Therefore, our results may not be generalizable to individuals who are not interested in self-management of their health. Conclusion: Our results suggest that home telemonitoring in patients with advanced CKD is feasible using a CKD-specific platform like VIEWER. We anticipate that improved functionality with incorporation of feedback from this study will result in greater long-term adherence. A future randomized clinical trial is planned.

N2  - Background: As a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Sydney Local Health District in New South Wales, Australia, launched the rpavirtual program, the first full-scale virtual hospital in Australia, to remotely monitor and follow up stable patients with COVID-19. As part of the intervention, a pulse oximeter wearable device was delivered to patients to monitor their oxygen saturation levels, a critical indicator of COVID-19 patient deterioration. Understanding users’ perceptions toward the device is fundamental to assessing its usability and acceptability and contributing to the effectiveness of the intervention, but no research to date has explored the user experience of the pulse oximeter for remote monitoring in this setting. Objective: This study aimed to explore the use, performance, and acceptability of the pulse oximeter by clinicians and patients in rpavirtual during COVID-19. Methods: Semistructured interviews and usability testing were conducted. Stable adult patients with COVID-19 (aged ≥18 years) who used the pulse oximeter and were monitored by rpavirtual, and rpavirtual clinicians monitoring these patients were interviewed. Clinicians could be nurses, doctors, or staff who were part of the team that assisted patients with the use of the pulse oximeter. Usability testing was conducted with patients who had the pulse oximeter when they were contacted. Interviews were coded using the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability. Usability testing was conducted using a think-aloud protocol. Data were collected until saturation was reached. Results: Twenty-one patients (average age 51, SD 13 years) and 15 clinicians (average age 41, SD 11 years) completed the interview. Eight patients (average age 51, SD 13 years) completed the usability testing. All participants liked the device and thought it was easy to use. They also had a good understanding of how to use the device and the device’s purpose. Patients’ age and device use–related characteristics (eg, the warmth of hands and hand steadiness) were identified by users as factors negatively impacting the accurate use of the pulse oximeter. Conclusions: Patients and clinicians had very positive perceptions of the pulse oximeter for COVID-19 remote monitoring, indicating high acceptability and usability of the device. However, factors that may impact the accuracy of the device should be considered when delivering interventions using the pulse oximeter for remote monitoring. Targeted instructions about the use of the device may be necessary for specific populations (eg, older people and patients unfamiliar with technology). Further research should focus on the integration of the pulse oximeter data into electronic medical records for real-time and secure patient monitoring.

N2  - Background: Clinical trials often face challenges in efficient data collection and participant monitoring. To address these issues, we developed the IMPACT platform, comprising a real-time mobile application for data collection and a web-based dashboard for remote monitoring and management. Methods: This article presents the design, development, and usability assessment of the IMPACT platform customized for patients with post-bariatric surgery hypoglycemia (PBH). We focus on adapting key IMPACT components, including continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), symptom tracking, and meal logging, as crucial elements for user-friendly and efficient PBH monitoring. Results: The adapted IMPACT platform demonstrated effectiveness in data collection and remote participant monitoring. The mobile application allowed patients to easily track their data, while the clinician dashboard provided a comprehensive overview of enrolled patients, featuring filtering options and alert mechanisms for identifying data collection issues. The platform incorporated various visual representations, including time plots and category-based visualizations, which greatly facilitated data interpretation and analysis. The System Usability Scale questionnaire results indicated a high level of usability for the web dashboard, with an average score of 86.3 out of 100. The active involvement of clinicians throughout the development process ensured that the platform allowed for the collection and visualization of clinically meaningful data. Conclusions: By leveraging IMPACT’s existing features and infrastructure, the adapted version streamlined data collection, analysis, and trial customization for PBH research. The platform’s high usability underscores its alignment with the requirements for conducting research using continuous real-world data in PBH patients and other populations of interest.

N2  - Although telehealth, and in particular RPM, have demonstrated to drive many benefits, such as reduction in cost and hospital-acquired infections, previous research has shown many usability challenges when patients operate a medical device without supervision of a medical professional. To combat this issue, the Pi-CON methodology is applied to develop a novel sensor with the objective to continuously acquire a patient’s vital signs from a distance, without the need to attach any markers or sensors to the patient, and with limited user interaction required. Pi-CON stands for passive, continuous and non-contact, and describes a way to improve the user experience for patients or caregivers that have a need to perform a vital signs measurement themselves, without the presence of a medical professional. The developed sensor utilises radar and optical sensing technologies and transmits acquired data to a cloud-based service where it can be viewed in near real-time by the patient or family members from anywhere via an intuitive user interface. This user interface, as well as the sensor itself were designed based on design needs and requirements to adhere to the user-centered design process. The development of the sensor, including utilised technologies, components, and the user interface are presented, including inspirations for future work.

N2  - Introduction/Background Older adults are disproportionately affected by cancer, but there are significant barriers to studying cancer treatment tolerance in this population, including low enrollment in clinical trials and a lack of age-related outcome measures. Technology, such as wearable sensors and remote monitoring through tablets and smartphones, has the potential to overcome these barriers, but older adults may face challenges with adoption. Participatory design involves co-designing technology with end-users, is a promising strategy to enhance technology use among older adults. We present the usability results of GeRI, a technology-based platform for monitoring cancer treatment toxicity and aging metrics in the homes of older adults with cancer, which uses a simplified interface to collect activity, nutrition and symptom metrics. Objective(s) To summarize usability scores and feedback of a customized platform, GeRI, connecting a tablet, wrist accelerometer, and scale that can be used to remotely collect frailty, activity, and nutrition markers from older adult cancer survivors and caregivers. Methods In this participatory design study, n=7 older cancer survivors (OCS) and n=3 caregivers (CG) were recruited through the University of Chicago Cancer Center and Office of Community Engagement and Cancer Health Equity. They were given a GeRI prototype (Figure 1) to try at home for at least 2 weeks with access to technical support and a user manual. Semi-structured interviews were then conducted over videoconferencing. Participants were given a 10-item System Usability Scale (SUS) and a modified satisfaction and feature likeability survey (e.g., five-point Likert scales on their overall satisfaction with the platform as well as the touchscreen, user interface, font/notification size, wrist accelerometer). Based on their response, we probed further to identify ways to improve their experience with GeRI. (Figure Presented) Results The study's results on GeRI showed positive feedback from the predominantly minority older cancer survivors (mean age 74.9 [SD 6.6], Male, n=5 Black, n=6 Prostate Cancer) and caregivers (mean age 55, Female, n=2 Black) who consented and interviewed. The mean SUS score (0-100) was 92.8 (SD 8.7, range 72.5 - 100), and the mean overall satisfaction score (1-5) with the GeRI platform was 4.9 (SD 0.3) for all participants involved. Figure 2 depicts individual SUS item responses stratified by user type (OCS or CG). OCS mean SUS scores were 91.5 (SD 9.5), while the CG mean SUS was 95.8 (SD 7.2). 100% of participants rated the touchscreen, user interface, and wrist accelerometer as 'Excellent' or 'Very Good'. 100% and 90% agreed that the size of notifications and font were sufficient, respectively, while only 70% believed that alerts and notifications were adequate enough to remind them to engage with the tablet. Condensed quick start guides or instructional pictures/videos on the tablet (n= 8), sound or voice notifications (n=7), improved task labeling (n=7), and symptom selection organization (n=7) were reported as features to enhance usability. The 2 highest-ranked enhancements by participants were 'Messages from my Doctor' (n=4) and 'My Smartwatch/Smart Scale Data' (n=4). Conclusion The GeRI platform is the first open-source data collection platform targeting older adults with cancer and demonstrated high usability, with a mean SUS score of 92.8. However, more work is needed to optimize the user experience in a more diverse sample. The results of this study provide early design guidance for developers, including the most requested features, such as biometric data and provider communication, and recommendations for improved user materials, task notifications, and labeling/organization. Further participatory design studies with diverse older cancer cohorts are needed and planned to improve the user experience and maximize the adoption of the GeRI platform.

N2  - Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a progressive neuromuscular disease impairing daily living. Currently, symptom severity is assessed by clinical assessments. Such assessments are limited in their ability to continuously capture changes and to capture the full impact of the disease. Remotely capturing data related to daily activities could provide additional insights in the disease. This study investigated the feasibility of using smartphones and wearables to capture symptoms. 38 FSHD patients and 20 non-FSHD control subjects were monitored using a smartphone for 6 weeks. At the first and last day of the study period, clinicians assessed the subjects' FSHD Clinical Score and Timed Up and Go time. Subjects installed the monitoring app on their smartphones, were given a smartwatch, and were instructed to record their weight and blood pressure (BP) weekly. The user experience was assessed at week 6 using a questionnaire. We built a model based on the remote data to distinguish between FSHD and control subjects. Overall, the app was well tolerated, but 67% of the subjects noticed reduced battery life. We classified FSHD and non- FSHD controls with 93% accuracy, 100% sensitivity, and 80% specificity. Features relating to smartphone acceleration, app usage, location, physical activity, sleep, and call behaviour were the most salient features for the classification. Remote monitoring data collection allows for the collection of daily activity data in FSHD patients and control subjects for 6 weeks. Furthermore, we demonstrated the ability to detect differences in features in FSHD patients and non- FSHD controls using smartphones and wearables.

N2  - (1) Background: Continuous monitoring of tacrolimus (TAC), mycophenolic acid (MPA), and creatinine (Cre) after renal transplantation is vitally important. In this study, we developed a new method based on volumetric absorptive microsampling (VAMS) combined with Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography–Tandem Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) to simultaneously quantify three analytes including TAC, MPA, and Cre in whole blood. (2) Methods: The VAMS-based UPLC-MS/MS assay used a shared extraction and a single injection to simultaneously quantify the included TAC, MPA, and Cre. Development and validation were carried out following the Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency guidelines for the validation of bioanalytical methods. Moreover, clinical validation for the three analytes was performed in both dried blood spot (DBS) and VAMS. Furthermore, a willingness survey was conducted using the system usability scale (SUS) for renal transplant recipients. (3) Results: The assay was successfully validated for all analytes. No interference, carryover, or matrix effects were observed, and extraction recoveries and process efficiencies were >90.00%. Analysis was unaffected by hematocrit (0.20~0.60, L/L) and anticoagulants (EDTA-2K). Dried VAMS samples were stable for 7 days at ambient temperature and stable for at least 1 month at −20 °C. During clinical validation, the measured TAC, corrected MPA, and Cre concentrations of VAMS samples met the analytical standards (95.00%, 88.57%, and 92.50%). When more stringent clinical acceptance criteria were set, the results obtained by VAMS (90.00%, 71.43%, and 85.00%) better than DBS (77.50%, 62.86%, and 70.00%). Compared with DBS, the survey found that renal transplant recipients are more inclined to use VAMS. (4) Conclusions: A robust extraction and UPLC-MS/MS analysis method in VAMS tips was developed and fully validated for the simultaneous quantification of TAC, MPA, and Cre concentrations. This method provides analytical support for the one-sample remote monitoring of both immunosuppressive drug concentrations and renal function in allo-renal recipients. Based on the good consistency between this method and the routine detection of venous blood samples and higher patient satisfaction than DBS, we believe that VAMS sampling can be a better alternative to venous whole-blood sampling.

N2  - Lactose-free milk is rising in popularity among consumers due to its claim to be a better digestible product compared to regular fluid milk. For that reason, concentrating on this food is a good alternative for increasing its versatility and usability in different dairy industry segments. Block freeze concentration (BFC) is a simple technology used to concentrate liquid foods through ice crystal formation and subsequent removal of water. Thus, this work aimed to test two variants of the BFC technique on lactose-free milk concentration. In the first approach, it was investigated the centrifugation-assisted BFC of skim lactose-free milk by applying a factorial experimental design. Temperature, time, and rotation speed were the factors, and the response variables included the concentrate yield, concentration index, and efficiency of the process. Concentrate yield and concentration index were mainly affected by the centrifugation temperature. On the other hand, individual factors did not have a significant effect on the efficiency, only their interactions. In the case of centrifugation-assisted BFC in a single step, the condition at 40°C, 70 min, and 4500 rpm was considered the best, given the highest values of efficiency and concentrate yield (80.87 and 67.02, respectively), and still an excellent value for concentration index (2.05). Conversely, the condition at 30°C, 45 min, and 3500 rpm was chosen to integrate a freeze concentration process in two stage. Then, the ice obtained from the first cycle was subjected to the vacuum-assisted BFC, which consisted in the second cycle. The concentrate obtained from the vacuum-assisted BFC presented contents of total solids, carbohydrates, and protein 2.95, 3.00, and 2.91 times more than the initial lactose-free milk, respectively. Therefore, we believe that the concentrates obtained can be used for the development of innovative lactose-free dairy products. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Using concentration processes in the dairy industry can significantly contribute to enhancing the overall efficiency of milk processing since huge quantities of water from milk can be reduced, increasing the total solids content. In turn, dairy products that provide a high amount of solids (especially protein) are gaining in popularity among consumers, with consequent interest from researchers. In addition, milk concentration shows advantages in terms of processing, packaging, transportation, and handling. Since most changes occur in an aqueous environment, the removal of some parts of water results in the preservation of milk. It is noteworthy that dairy industries are concerned principally with food preservation, green technologies, and the production of high-quality products. Thus, concentration processes could favor the development of milk products rich in proteins to meet certain demands on functional and nutritional properties, for example in beverages and formulated food.

N2  - Objectives: Telemedicine offers many possibilities, such as remote monitoring of patients and following them up through the development of the disease, giving support to them and their caregivers. The need for a telemedicine approach to the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is widely acknowledged. Neuropsychological testing is a crucial component of the assessment of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and represents a gateway to biomarker assessment for prodromal AD diagnosis. The aim of TENÈPSIA project is the development of a high quality, tablet-based remote neuropsychological assessment platform. Methods: The Italian Neurological Society (SIN), the Italian Neuropsychological Society (SINP) and the Italian Neurological Society for Dementia (SINDEM) promoted the organization of a Working Group (WG) of experts in the clinical and neuropsychological assessments of dementia. The WG is in charge for the selection of scales and tests, their digital validation and implementation. The project is a partnership between Biogen Italy and SIN; in particular, Biogen provides digital, scientific and communication support, funding the development of digital platform through REPLY, which is the software developer of platform, and INSIDE AI that manages the in-silico test required for the certification as medical device. Results: TheWG selected a battery of rating scales and neuropsychological tests widely used in Italian clinical practice and suitable for a digitalization approach. These include questionnaires for the assessment of depression and functional status and tests of long-term memory, language, visuo-spatial abilities, executive functions, and social cognition. Software development took particular care in the usability of the platform and to the possibility of remote control of subject performance by the examiner. Discussion: The TENÈPSIA platform will enter the phase of beta testing in June 2022; in silico testing is proceeding in parallel with software development. In October 2022 it will be issued to the Notified Body to get the certification as Medical Device II A by December 2022. The subsequent phases will be dedicated to the collection of normative data in healthy subjects and validation on MCI and early AD clinical samples. Conclusions: Tele-neuropsychology is an area of research in constant progress, which has received an accelerated demand for tools and services to support clinical practice during the pandemic. A scientifically validated, digitalized platform, allowing a high level of automation in the procedures of stimuli administration, response collection, score correction and interpretation will favor the possibility of remote assessment with benefits for patients, families, and treatment centers.

N2  - Introduction: Do assistive technologies (AT) enhance QoL of older people and care professionals in long-term care facilities? We have previously reported on the impact of using a monitoring system with an infrared camera and communication robots (Obayashi et al. 2020). Further improvements were made to the detection accuracy of the camera, and functionalities for verbal interaction were added. This paper reports on these efforts in nursing homes, and their impact on the ground. Methods: The study was conducted with 34 older people and 20 care professionals in nursing homes. An infrared sensor and a biosensor were installed on the ceiling of each resident's room. When the camera detects movement by the resident, it notifies the care staff via the mobile terminal. Its detection accuracy was improved against sunlight and physical obstacles. A variety of qualitative and quantitative data (e.g. sleeping patterns and social participation of older people, system usability and staff task analysis) were collected before and after installation. Communication functions were added to the system. Results: False detection rates of the monitoring camera decreased significantly. Using the improved system for the duration of 34 days, 602 alerts were recorded in total and 430 staff visits to rooms during night shifts were spared. The task analysis revealed that time available for direct caregiving increased (e.g. direct communication: From 2 to 55 min), while indirect care activities decreased. After the introduction of communicative functions, system usability decreased, primarily due to inaudibility. However, the qualitative data support the idea of an interactive system. Key conclusions: Faced with the challenge of meeting increasing demand for person-centered care under limited resources, there will be a greater need for better integration of improved AT. The study indicates AT's potential for enhancing the quality of care for all.

N2  - Introduction: Timely recognition of clinical deterioration in oncological patients remains challenging. Remote monitoring of vital signs may provide support to current clinical practices but need to be extensively tested before routine implementation in the oncological environment. In our pilot project a telemedicine system was implemented for the early detection of vital signs deterioration in oncological patients with a high risk for complications, without need for hospitalization. Main objectives were the evaluation of the sense of safety and well-being of patients at home and feasibility of remote monitoring. Methods: The used monitoring system is based on the IIa-class medical device VitalPatch (by VitalConnect) to monitor continuously in real-time 7 vital parameters for 7 days: respiratory frequency, heart rate, temperature, a single ECG lead, posture, number of steps and fall detection. An oximeter was integrated into the system and a smartphone was provided to each patient as gateway for data transmission. Eligible patients received the medical devices at home and were instructed by a specialized nurse. Access to clinical information and remote monitoring was ensured to the patient's family doctor and medical oncologist through an online platform with the support of a professional 24/7 emergency call center (responsible for the management of alerts based on predefined thresholds). At the end of the monitoring period, a 14-item questionnaire was administered to patients exploring their sense of safety, satisfaction with monitoring and usability of the device. Results: Thirty patients were monitored from October 2021 to July 2022. Median age at enrolment was 68.8 years (range 43 - 87). Most patients (78%) judged the devices very easy to use. The monitoring system increased the sense of safety of 96% of patients. The satisfaction with remote medical assistance was “very high” and “high” for 88% of patients. Remote monitoring information led to treatment change in 37% of patients. Five out of 30 patients had an acute event during the monitoring period, only 1 of them needed hospitalization. Conclusions: Remote monitoring of vital signs of oncological patients with high risk for complications was feasible and well perceived by all patients. Future studies need to evaluate the impact of home monitoring on patient outcome as well as the cost-effectiveness of this new approach.

N2  - In the last two decades, the sensors miniaturization, along with the communication technologies progression and computational advances drew the way towards the development of wearable technology. Wearable sensors make continuous long-term remote monitoring of performance dynamics in relevant ecological settings available to many people with chronic disease, including multiple sclerosis (MS). In conjunction with telemedicine and online apps, wearable technology promises a major expansion of the scope for people with MS (PwMS) by allowing more confident descriptions of prognoses, the relative long-term benefits, more safe disease-modifying treatments (DMT) and improved self-management. Moreover, together with registries and electronic health records, more detailed MS-specific data could be easier shared between clinicians, provide data needed to improve the DMT impact, and characterize clinically relevant interactions between MS and other diseases. Wearable technology has been adopted in MS to measure all the most relevant clinical domains. The nature of MS evolution would have firstly required the use of wearable sensors able to assess the presence of physical changes due to the disease (i.e. gait, posture and upper limb disorders). Activity monitors, accelerometers and gyroscopes are the oldest sensors introduced in the MS clinical context because those were the most readily available technology. Nowadays, variables such as event detection, spatiotemporal indexes, estimation of joint kinematics, and postural balance parameters obtained from these sensors are widely used in the assessment, rehabilitation, assistance and disease prediction of PwMS. More recently, the clinical monitoring in MS took advantage of the development and validation of smartphone apps. Apps implementing standard tests (e.g. the Symbol Digit Modalities Test) and gamification have mainly supported the remote cognitive evaluation whereas visual analogue scales and patient reported outcomes have been mostly used to long-term monitor fatigue, mood symptoms (e.g. anxiety), pain and QoL. Despite the advancements continuously evolve and research findings are increasingly reliable, wearable devices usability is poorly measured and more attention should be paid to this aspect in order to propose future tools tailored on the needs of PwMS. Healthcare research is in the midst of a paradigm shift and wearable technology plays a crucial role allowing an ecological monitoring of human behaviour.

N2  - Objective: This work presents an evaluation of the satisfaction of physicians from using a continuous telemonitoring system for patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Background: The standard practice for evaluating PD symptoms is highly subjective and inaccurate and can be considered flawed [1], [2]. The route to objective evaluation of PD symptoms lies in the use of continuous telemonitoring systems (i.e., recording for some days per month), which could also help personalize and provide remote access to quality healthcare services. The application of telemonitoring to PD has been studied extensively as a new paradigm for managing the disease in general [3]-[7] and also during the COVID-19 pandemic [8]-[10], which made a lot of patients avoid visits to physicians and healthcare units. Methods: The user satisfaction and clinical benefits of the telemonitoring system [11] was evaluated in a multicenter, single arm, clinical trial. The study includes a baseline and two follow-up patient visits (month 3 and 6). At each visit, a number of different scales and questionnaires are filled by patients and physicians. A specially-designed questionnaire is used to evaluate the physician satisfaction and the usability of the system for each patient visit. Results: From 14 completed physician questionnaires we extracted the following statistics: 85.7% of physicians said that the use of the system helped to better evaluate patients' symptoms. 78.6% of responders indicated that the system helped to faster assess patients' symptoms. 78.6% of physicians said that the use of the system helped them make decisions about therapeutic interventions in patients. More specifically, based on physicians' input, there were 16 medication changes based on system-provided information. 92.9% of replies indicate that the use of the system helps to accurately record patient's symptoms in their environment, without limiting their daily activities. 85.7% of physicians believe that the use of the system helps them to better assess the general situation of patients in their own environment, without being a burden to their clinical work. Conclusions: The results demonstrate that the vast majority of physicians agree a telemonitoring wearable system could help them better and faster assess the symptoms of patients in their own environment, without additional burden for physicians, while providing meaningful information in the decision-making process for therapeutic interventions.

N2  - Background: Patients with cancer undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy face an elevated risk of developing serious infection as a consequence of their treatment, which lowers their white blood cell count and, more specifically, their absolute neutrophil count. This condition is known as neutropenia. Neutropenia accompanied by a fever is referred to as febrile neutropenia, a common side effect of chemotherapy with a high mortality rate. The timely detection of severe neutropenia (<500 absolute neutrophil count/μL) is critical in detecting and managing febrile neutropenia. Current methods rely on blood draws, which limit them to clinical settings and do not allow frequent or portable monitoring. In this study, we demonstrated the usability of PointCheck, a noninvasive device for neutropenia screening, in a simulated home environment without clinical supervision. PointCheck automatically performs microscopy through the skin of the finger to image the blood flowing through superficial microcapillaries and enables the remote monitoring of neutropenia status, without requiring venipuncture. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the usability of PointCheck, a noninvasive optical technology for screening severe neutropenia, with the goal of identifying potential user interface, functionality, and design issues from the perspective of untrained users. Methods: We conducted a multicenter study using quantitative and qualitative approaches to evaluate the usability of PointCheck across 154 untrained participants. We used a mixed method approach to gather usability data through user testing observations, a short-answer qualitative questionnaire, and a standardized quantitative System Usability Scale (SUS) survey to assess perceived usability and satisfaction. Results: Of the 154 participants, we found that 108 (70.1%) scored above 80.8 on the SUS across all sites, with a mean SUS score of 86.1 across all sites. Furthermore, the SUS results indicated that, out of the 151 users who completed the SUS survey, 145 (96%) found that they learned how to use PointCheck very quickly, and 141 (93.4%) felt very confident when using the device. Conclusions: We have shown that PointCheck, a novel technology for noninvasive, home-based neutropenia detection, can be safely and effectively operated by first-time users. In a simulated home environment, these users found it easy to use, with a mean SUS score of 86.1, indicating an excellent perception of usability and placing this device within the top tenth percentile of systems evaluated for usability by the SUS.

T1  - Performance and Usability Evaluation of an Extended Reality Platform to Monitor Patient's Health during Surgical Procedures
LA  - English
KW  - human
KW  - operating room
N2  - An extended-reality (XR) platform for real-time monitoring of patients' health during surgical procedures is proposed. The proposed system provides real-time access to a comprehensive set of patients' information, which are made promptly available to the surgical team in the operating room (OR). In particular, the XR platform supports the medical staff by automatically acquiring the patient's vitals from the operating room instrumentation and displaying them in real-time directly on an XR headset. Furthermore, information regarding the patient clinical record is also shown upon request. Finally, the XR-based monitoring platform also allows displaying in XR the video stream coming directly from the endoscope. The innovative aspect of the proposed XR-based monitoring platform lies in the comprehensiveness of the available information, in its modularity and flexibility (in terms of adaption to different sources of data), ease of use, and most importantly, in a reliable communication, which are critical requirements for the healthcare field. To validate the proposed system, experimental tests were conducted using instrumentation typically available in the operating room (i.e., a respiratory ventilator, a patient monitor for intensive care, and an endoscope). The overall results showed (i) an accuracy of the data communication greater than 99 %, along with (ii) an average time response below ms, and (iii) satisfying feedback from the SUS questionnaires filled out by the physicians after intensive use.

KW  - inflammation
KW  - mobile application
KW  - telemedicine
N2  - The immune system plays a key role in protecting living beings against bacteria, viruses, and fungi, among other pathogens, which may be harmful and represent a threat to our own health. However, for reasons that are not fully understood, in some people this protective mechanism accidentally attacks the organs and tissues, thus causing inflammation and leads to the development of autoimmune diseases. Remote monitoring of human health involves the use of sensor network technology as a means of capturing patient data, and wearable devices, such as smartwatches, have lately been considered good collectors of biofeedback data, owing to their easy connectivity with a mHealth system. Moreover, the use of gamification may encourage the frequent usage of such devices and behavior changes to improve self-care for autoimmune diseases. This study reports on the use of wearable sensors for inflammation surveillance and autoimmune disease management based on a literature search and evaluation of an app prototype with fifteen stakeholders, in which eight participants were diagnosed with autoimmune or inflammatory diseases and four were healthcare professionals. Of these, six were experts in human-computer interaction to assess critical aspects of user experience. The developed prototype allows the monitoring of autoimmune diseases in pre-, during-, and post-inflammatory crises, meeting the personal needs of people with this health condition. The findings suggest that the proposed prototype-iShU-achieves its purpose and the overall experience may serve as a foundation for designing inflammation surveillance and autoimmune disease management monitoring solutions.

N2  - Background: With the spread of COVID-19, telemedicine solutions became crucial to release continuous and remote assistance to chronic patients. The rapid transition to telemedicine solutions did not allow a complete assessment of the user experience by both patients and medical personnel. Despite the well-known benefits in remote care, the lack of usability evaluation of already existing technologies for the vital signs measurement has emerged. A telemedicine platform must match video communication between patients and the medical staff with the possibility to measure vital parameters. Furthermore, technological assistance may overcome the unfamiliarity with telemedicine and drastically reduce the learning time for both patients and medical personnel. Objectives: The research work presents a method to improve the user experience of a telemedicine service based on the combination of televisits and telemonitoring with wearable sensors for heart failure patients. Skilled technological staff is proposed by the presented method to lead the learning process of both medical personnel and patients in order to reach a high level of usability in less than 6 months. Methods: The proposed method is composed of 5 steps: identification of technological staff and end users; selection of the telemedicine platform; design of questionnaires for usability analysis; training of clinicians and patients; final usability evaluation of the telemedicine platform by means of customized satisfaction questionnaires and Post-Study System Usability Questionnaires (PSSUQs). The methodological approach has been tested in collaboration with a heart failure clinic by involving 5 physicians, 5 nurses, 15 heart failure patients, a research engineer and 4 technicians. A platform with 3 wearable sensors has been chosen: a wireless thermometer, a finger pulse-oximeter and an undershirt have been used for the detection of ECG trace. While these devices allowed asynchronous measurements of physiological data, scheduled televisits have been used for direct communication between physicians and patients. Results: Satisfaction questionnaires of patients and clinicians reached respectively 65.18% and 65.83%, while PSSUQ scores were respectively 91.73% and 81.70%. Both groups of end users confirmed a good level of usability and their satisfaction about the ease of use and the perceived quality of the instrumentation. Moreover, 73% of patients did not require help from caregivers to use the kit of sensors. The results have been reached in 5.5 months according to the aim defined initially. Research engineers have played a crucial role in helping clinicians and patients to improve the user experience with the telemedicine platform. Conclusions: The high level of usability and satisfaction confirmed that the proposed methodological approach helps to learn the technological features of the telemedicine platforms, which are based on different types of technology, such as web applications, wearable sensors and virtual calls. The positive results with heart failure patients encouraged to plan further research studies by using the designed method with other categories of chronic patients.

N2  - Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has advanced market awareness of the benefits of remote-controlled ventilators to reduce the exposure of healthcare workers to patients with COVID-19, enable more rapid and frequent ventilator setting adjustment, and preserve limited personal protective equipment. The US FDA permitted manufacturers to add remote monitoring and control capabilities to ventilators and infusion pumps through immediate in effect guidance [1,2]. When integrated with tele-critical care systems, remote control of medical devices allows distant clinical experts to collaborate with local clinicians to “virtually” manage the therapy of patients at hotspots. Core remote control capabilities can also be used by software applications to implement medical device control algorithms for Software as a Medical Device (SaMD). The US Army /TATRC launched the National Tele-Critical Care Network (NETCCN) to rapidly develop and deploy a platform to support COVID-19 disaster response [3]. We are investigating technical solutions, communication protocols, and safety assurance measures for integrating remote control of medical devices to the NETCCN systems. Methods: We developed an architecture and a prototype system (Figure 1) to investigate safety, security, and interoperability requirements for integration of remote control of medical devices with tele-critical care systems. The prototype system is based on OpenICE [4], an open-source interoperability platform developed by our program to transmit data and control medical devices at the patient's bedside. Customized interfaces (hardware and software) translate device proprietary protocols to ISO/IEEE 11073-10101 terminology over DDS middleware. Remote control applications of devices connected to OpenICE are implemented as either stand-alone OpenICE apps, which can be deployed inside or immediately outside the patient's room, or as web-based apps, which can be launched from any location to communicate with the OpenICE system. We refer to the former as “nearpatient remote control”, which may be at the bedside or co-located outside the room, and the latter as “far remote” control where the operator does not have physical access to the patient or medical equipment. Our prototype system uses the RTI Web Integration Service [5] to enable web-based control applications to communicate with the connected devices. Results: The generic architecture in Figure 1 is device agnostic: it can be used with critical care ventilators, IV infusion pumps, and other devices, provided that the device interfaces support remote control. As a proof of concept, we applied this architecture to a Q Core Sapphire IV infusion pump using a non-clinical control interface, and confirmed that the infusion rate could be adjusted by both near-patient and far remote (web) control applications with generally acceptable delays (3∼8 seconds from remote control action until the pump executes the change). This prototype system allows the exploration and validation of risks associated with medical device remote control in the tele-critical care context. An example of a risk identified in our study relates contention between near and far “loci of control”. Unexpected device behavior can occur if there is no mechanism to 1) explicitly prioritize loci of control that may occur simultaneously (e.g., always prioritize local control over far control to enable the local provider to regain control or prevent remote control); and 2) clearly indicate where the locus of control resides. Other risks may arise due to issues related to cybersecurity, network QoS, permission for remote control, and usability (e.g., use errors associated with far remote control due to the lack of a real-time view of the patient). We are collaborating with the AAMI InterOperability Working Group (IOWG) to share the experience and lessons learned in this effort to develop a safety standard for medical device remote control, and with other performers in the NETCCN portfolio.

N2  - Symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD) can be controlled well, but treatment often requires expert judgment. Telemedicine and sensor-based assessments can allow physicians to better observe the evolvement of symptoms over time, in particular with motor fluctuations. In addition, they potentially allow less frequent visits to the expert’s office and facilitate care in rural areas. A variety of systems with different strengths and shortcomings has been investigated in recent years. We designed a multimodal telehealth intervention (TelePark) to mitigate the shortcomings of individual systems and assessed the feasibility of our approach in 12 patients with PD over 12 weeks in preparation for a larger randomized controlled trial. TelePark uses video visits, a smartphone app, a camera system, and wearable sensors. Structured training included setting up the equipment in patients’ homes and group-based online training. Usability was assessed by questionnaires and semi-standardized telephone interviews. Overall, 11 out of 12 patients completed the trial (5 female, 6 male). Mean age was 65 years, mean disease duration 7 years, mean MoCA score 27. Adherence was stable throughout the study and 79% for a short questionnaire administered every second day, 62% for medication confirmation, and 33% for an electronic Hauser diary. Quality of life did not change in the course of the study, and a larger cohort will be required to determine the effect on motor symptoms. Interviews with trial participants identified motivations to use such systems and areas for improvements. These insights can be helpful in designing similar trials.

N2  - Flexible pressure sensors have been studied as wearable voice-recognition devices to be utilized in human-machine interaction. However, the development of highly sensitive, skin-attachable, and comfortable sensing devices to achieve clear voice detection remains a considerable challenge. Herein, we present a wearable and flexible pressure and temperature sensor with a sensitive response to vibration, which can accurately recognize the human voice by combing with the artificial neural network. The device consists of a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) printed with a silver electrode, a filament-microstructured polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) film embedded with single-walled carbon nanotubes and a polyimide (PI) film sputtered with a patterned Ti/Pt thermistor strip. The developed pressure sensor exhibited a pressure sensitivity of 0.398 kPa-1 in the low-pressure regime, and the fabricated temperature sensor shows a desirable temperature coefficient of resistance of 0.13% ∘C in the range of 25 ∘C to 105 ∘C. Through training and testing the neural network model with the waveform data of the sensor obtained from human pronunciation, the vocal fold vibrations of different words can be successfully recognized, and the total recognition accuracy rate can reach 93.4%. Our results suggest that the fabricated sensor has substantial potential for application in the human-computer interface fields, such as voice control, vocal healthcare monitoring, and voice authentication.

N2  - Background: Up to half of pts with cancer receiving systemic therapy have unplanned emergency department or hospital admission during treatment. ML41539 is a prospective observational study of an app to collect electronic patient-reported outcomes (ePROs) and a wearable biosensor (Samsung Galaxy Watch3) to evaluate the use of a remote monitoring system to improve symptom management and reduce unplanned admissions (ISRCTN25569053). Here, we report the initial feasibility and usability results for the ePRO app and biosensor. Methods: The study includes a vanguard phase (n = 32) to obtain early feedback on pt experience of the app and biosensor. After 2 weeks of continuous biosensor monitoring and daily ePRO reporting, 10 pts participated in semi-structured telephone interviews conducted by trained study staff. Open-ended questions addressed usability and technology-driven facilitators and barriers. Pts were also asked about ease of use and biosensor comfort on a 10-point Likert scale (higher scores reflected better usability and comfort). Transcripts were summarized using a FITTE-adapted framework and coded in ATLAS.ti 22.0.11.0. Coded data were summarized and consolidated into matrices to identify areas for improvement in future study phases. Results: Participants were approached until the target of 10 completed interviews was met. Respondents resembled the overall study population with regards to gender, race, ethnicity, age, and adherence to wearing the sensor and completing daily ePROs. For ease of use, the average rating among participants was 9 for the app (range 8.5-10) and 9.5 for the biosensor (range 7-10). Biosensor comfort was rated 7 on average (range 3-9). The most common words used to describe the app were easy, simple, and straightforward. Sixty percent of pts said that the watch needed to be charged too often and that their experience could be improved by offering more sensor functions and allowing pts to view and track their ePRO responses and biometric data. Sixty percent of pts also supported using these technologies to monitor symptoms during cancer therapy, stating that it was a good idea or useful, especially if it prevented hospitalization or increased communication with their care team. Conclusions: Overall, pts reported positive experiences wearing the sensor and using the ePRO app to report their symptoms during the 2-week observation period. Ease of use was high for both the app and biosensor. A majority reported dissatisfaction with the battery life of the biosensor. Most stated that they would prefer more opportunities to interact directly with the devices and to monitor their own symptoms by viewing collected ePRO and biometric data. Building this type of functionality into the app and sensor for future study phases could help pts engage more with the devices and potentially improve adherence.

N2  - Background: For patients with heart failure (HF), an increased risk of hospital admissions exists. While noninvasive methods of telemonitoring have thus far generally failed to predict and reduce the risk of admissions, invasive hemodynamic monitoring of pulmonary artery pressure has shown efficacy in this regard. However, data from the pulmonary artery fail to accurately estimate left-side filling pressures in substantial number of patients with HF. The aim of this study, therefore, was to describe the feasibility, safety, and accuracy of a novel wireless left atrial pressure (LAP) monitoring system in HF patients. Methods: The V-LAP Left Atrium Monitoring System for Patients With Chronic Systolic and Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure (VECTOR-HF) study is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm, open-label, first-in human clinical trial to assess the safety, performance, and usability of the V-LAP system (Vectorious Medical Technologies) in NYHA functional class III HF patients. The device was implanted in the interatrial septum via a percutaneous transseptal approach, guided by fluoroscopy and echocardiography. Primary end points included the successful deployment of the implant, ability to perform initial pressure measurements, and safety outcomes. Results: In this ongoing study, 24 patients have been implanted with the V-LAP system, yielding a 100% procedural success rate. No device-related complications have occurred. LAP was reported accurately, correlating with wedge pressure at 3 months (R = 0.86). After 6 months, NYHA functional class was better than at baseline (2.6 ± 0.6 vs 3.0 ± 0.0; P = 0.007), while 6-minute walk test distance had not changed significantly (313.9 ± 144.9 vs 232.5 ± 129.9 m; P = 0.076). Conclusion: The V-LAP left atrium monitoring system appears to be safe and accurate. Initial results also suggest possible improvement in clinical symptoms of HF.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Miglitol is a potent alpha-glucosidase inhibitor that is used as a hypoglycemic agent. The industrial synthesis route of miglitol involves the biotransformation from N-2-hydroxyethyl glucamine to 6-(N-hydroxyethyl)-amino-6-deoxy-alpha-l-sorbofuranose and the subsequent hydrogenation from 6-(N-hydroxyethyl)-amino-6-deoxy-alpha-l-sorbofuranose to miglitol. This study comprehensively investigated the hydrogenation process and catalyst, and the effect of operating parameters on the product yield. RESULTS: A 55.6% miglitol yield was obtained under the following optimal reaction conditions: 5 g L−1 palladium/carbon (Pd/C) (5% Pd); ethanol addition 1:1 ethanol:water (v/v); 80 g L−16-(N-hydroxyethyl)-amino-6-deoxy-alpha-l-sorbofuranose; reaction temperature 25 °C; solution pH 6; stirring speed 500 rpm; hydrogen pressure 1 MPa. The yield obtained was much higher than the average 36.8% in current industrial production. Catalyst deactivation during reuse was found to be caused by biological impurities, especially the macromolecular impurities introduced in previous biotransformation. The deposition of impurities on the porous support of the Pd/C catalyst may be the direct cause of catalyst deactivation. CONCLUSION: Optimal conditions for the hydrogenation in the synthesis of miglitol were determined. It also was confirmed that biological impurities need to be completely removed to avoid catalyst deactivation and to improve catalyst reusability.

N2  - During the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, different technologies, including telehealth, are maximised to mitigate the risks and consequences of the disease. Telehealth has been widely utilised because of its usability and safety in providing healthcare services during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, a systematic literature review which provides extensive evidence on the impact of COVID-19 through telehealth and which covers multiple directions in a large-scale research remains lacking. This study aims to review telehealth literature comprehensively since the pandemic started. It also aims to map the research landscape into a coherent taxonomy and characterise this emerging field in terms of motivations, open challenges and recommendations. Articles related to telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic were systematically searched in the WOS, IEEE, Science Direct, Springer and Scopus databases. The final set included (n = 86) articles discussing telehealth applications with respect to (i) control (n = 25), (ii) technology (n = 14) and (iii) medical procedure (n = 47). Since the beginning of the pandemic, telehealth has been presented in diverse cases. However, it still warrants further attention. Regardless of category, the articles focused on the challenges which hinder the maximisation of telehealth in such times and how to address them. With the rapid increase in the utilization of telehealth in different specialised hospitals and clinics, a potential framework which reflects the authors’ implications of the future application and opportunities of telehealth has been established. This article improves our understanding and reveals the full potential of telehealth during these difficult times and beyond.

N2  - Introduction. The ability to closely monitor patient vital signs is a key aspect of the management of patients requiring critical care. To theThe detection of changes in vital signs in real time can allow for more rapid review and interventions to be made. The current COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of detecting the deteriorating patient and the possibility of remote monitoring. use of a wearable wireless monitoring device. In this study, the device evaluated was the Caretaker ® 4 (CT4) from Caretaker Medical ®. We performed a staff evaluation of the CT4 device within a Critical Care Outreach Team (CCOT) with a view to augmenting the existing monitoring practices. Objectives. 1. To evaluate and consider the responses of members of the CCOT after trialling the device. 2. Consider how the experience of members of the CCOT in using this device would impact on their willingness to use this device in the future. Methods. This evaluation was conducted by nurses of the CCOT from based at the Royal Sussex County Hospital, Brighton, UK. Team members interacted with the CT4 by attaching, calibrating, recording observations, detaching, cleaning and storing the device. Staff evaluations were recording using a survey via the Qualtrics ® platform. Results. Ordinal survey data collected will were analysed using non-parametric descriptive statistics. Survey comments wierell be reviewed by thematic analysis. Of the 19 CCOT nursing staff 12 (63.2%) responses were recorded. Of the 12 respondents, 10 (83.3%) stated that they would use the CT4 on their patients in future. From the 96 recorded survey data points 81 (84.4%) either strongly or somewhat agreed that the CT4 was easier to use. Conclusion. The device (CT4) was being evaluated to assess whether the CCOT would use CT4 to monitor patients within their service, based on perceived usability. Use of the CT4 was positively received by the team in all areas assessed. Implementation of the device alongside the existing monitoring could be trialled with patient outcomes measured. This further work however would bewas limited in scope due to the current impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on critical care services. Use of this style of monitoring has potential use in other scenarios such as transferring critical care patients and remote monitoring of patients recently discharged from the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).

N2  - The purposes of this pilot study are to utilize digital remote monitoring to (a) evaluate the usability and satisfaction of a wireless blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) monitor and (b) determine whether these data can enable safe mobilization at home after same-day discharge (SDD) joint replacement. A population of 23 SDD patients undergoing unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA), total knee arthroplasty (TKA), or total hip arthroplasty (THA) were given a cellular BP/HR monitor, with real-time data capture. Patients took three readings after surgery, observing for specific blood pressure decreases, HR increases, or hypotensive symptoms. If any criteria applied, patients followed a hydration protocol and delayed ambulation. Home coaching was also provided to each patient. Patient experience was surveyed, and responses were assessed using descriptive statistics. Of 18 patients discharged (78%), 17 returned surveys, of which 100% reported successful device operation. The mean "ease of use" rating was 8.9/10; satisfaction with home coaching was 9.7/10; and belief that the protocol improved patient safety was 8.4/10. A total of 27.8% (n = 5) had hypotensive readings and appropriately delayed ambulation. Our pilot findings support the feasibility of and confirm the satisfaction with remote monitoring after SDD arthroplasty. All patients with symptoms of hypotension were successfully remotely managed using a standardized hydration protocol prior to safe mobilization.

N2  - The elderly is a continuous growth sector thanks to the life expectancy increase in Western society. This sector is especially at risk from the appearance of respiratory diseases and, therefore, is the most affected sector in the COVID-19 epidemic. Many of these elderly require continuous care in residences or by specialized caregivers, but these personal contacts put this sector at risk. In this work, an IoT system for elderly remote monitoring is studied, designed, developed and tested. This system is composed by a smart garment that records information from various physiological sensors in order to detect falls, sudden changes in body temperature, heart problems and heat stroke; This information is sent to a cloud server through a gateway located in the patient's residence, allowing to real-time monitor remotely patient's activity using a customized App, as well as receiving alerts in dangerous situations. This system has been tested with professional caregivers, obtaining usability and functionality surveys; and, in addition, a detailed power-consumption study has been carried out. The results, compared with other similar systems, demonstrate that the proposed one is useful, usable, works in real time and has a decent power consumption that allows the patient to carry it during all day without charging the battery.

N2  - Mobile health (mHealth) has emerged as a potential solution to providing valuable ecological information about the severity and burden of Parkinson's disease (PD) symptoms in real-life conditions. Objective: The objective of our study was to explore the feasibility and usability of an mHealth system for continuous and objective real-life measures of patients' health and functional mobility, in unsupervised settings. Methods: Patients with a clinical diagnosis of PD, who were able to walk unassisted, and had an Android smartphone were included. Patients were asked to answer a daily survey, to perform three weekly active tests, and to perform a monthly in-person clinical assessment. Feasibility and usability were explored as primary and secondary outcomes. An exploratory analysis was performed to investigate the correlation between data from the mKinetikos app and clinical assessments. Results: Seventeen participants (85%) completed the study. Sixteen participants (94.1%) showed a medium-to-high level of compliance with the mKinetikos system. A 6-point drop in the total score of the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire was observed. Conclusions: Our results support the feasibility of the mKinetikos system for continuous and objective real-life measures of a patient's health and functional mobility. The observed correlations of mKinetikos metrics with clinical data seem to suggest that this mHealth solution is a promising tool to support clinical decisions.

N2  - Although conventional skin-attachable electronics exhibit good functionalities, their direct attachment (without any adhesive) to human skin with sufficient conformal contact is challenging. Herein, all-solution-processed on-skin electronics based on self-reconfigurable high-weight-per- volume-gelatin (HWVG) film constructed using an effective, biocompatible water absorption-evaporation technique are demonstrated. Completely conformal contact of self-reconfigurable HWVG films is realized by rapidly inducing anisotropic swelling in the perpendicular direction and covering any curvature on the skin without spatial gap or void after shrinking. A sufficiently thin HWVG film (~2 um) exhibited higher adhesion owing to van der Waals force and the carboxylic acid and amine groups in HWVG film form cross-linkages through intermolecular bonds with human skin. Self-reconfigurable HWVG films with high biocompatibility are optimized to afford a superior efficiency of 87.83 % at a concentration of 20 % (w/v) and a storage modulus of 1822 MPa at 36.5 °C. Furthermore, functional nanoelectrodes consisting of self-reconfigurable silver nanowires/HWVG films for high-performance on-skin sensors allowing the detection of sensitive motion and electrophysiological signals, as well as an armband-type sensor system incorporated with a smartphone for health-care monitoring are demonstrated. Outstanding performances, including stability, reliability, flexibility, re-usability, biocompatibility, and permeability of on-skin electronics based on HWVG films can open-up a prospective route to realizing breathable human-machine interfaces based on biocompatible materials and processes.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Recent World Health Organization reports propose wearable devices to collect information on activity and walking speed as innovative health indicators. However, mainstream consumer-grade tracking devices and smartphone apps are often inaccurate and require long-term acceptability assessment. OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to assess the user acceptability of an instrumented shoe insole in frail older adults. This device monitors participants' walking speed and differentiates active walking from shuffling after step length calibration. METHODS: A multiphase evaluation has been designed: 9 older adults were evaluated in a living lab for a day, 3 older adults were evaluated at home for a month, and a prospective randomized trial included 35 older adults at home for 3 months. A qualitative research design using face-to-face and phone semistructured interviews was performed. Our hypothesis was that this shoe insole was acceptable in monitoring long-term outdoor and indoor walking. The primary outcome was participants' acceptability, measured by a qualitative questionnaire and average time of insole wearing per day. The secondary outcome described physical frailty evolution in both groups. RESULTS: Living lab results confirmed the importance of a multiphase design study with participant involvement. Participants proposed insole modifications. Overall acceptability had mixed results: low scores for reliability (2.1 out of 6) and high scores for usability (4.3 out of 6) outcomes. The calibration phase raised no particular concern. During the field test, a majority of participants (mean age 79 years) were very (10/16) or quite satisfied (3/16) with the insole's comfort at the end of the follow-up. Participant insole acceptability evolved as follows: 63% (12/19) at 1 month, 50% (9/18) at 2 months, and 75% (12/16) at 3 months. A total of 9 participants in the intervention group discontinued the intervention because of technical issues. All participants equipped for more than a week reported wearing the insole every day at 1 month, 83% (15/18) at 2 months, and 94% (15/16) at 3 months for 5.8, 6.3, and 5.1 hours per day, respectively. Insole data confirmed that participants effectively wore the insole without significant decline during follow-up for an average of 13.5 days per 4 months and 5.6 hours per day. For secondary end points, the change in frailty parameters or quality of life did not differ for those randomly assigned to the intervention group compared to usual care. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reports acceptability data on an instrumented insole in indoor and outdoor walking with remote monitoring in frail older adults under real-life conditions. To date, there is limited data in this population set. This thin instrumentation, including a flexible battery, was a technical challenge and seems to provide an acceptable solution over time that is valued by participants. However, users still raised certain acceptability issues. Given the growing interest in wearable health care devices, these results will be useful for future developments.

N2  - Background: Optimising red cell transfusion requires an understanding of both the risks and the benefits. Adverse events of red cell transfusions, like transfusion reactions and iron overload are reasons for considering a restrictive transfusion strategy. However, there are no completed trials in the outpatient setting for chronic transfusion-dependent patients, and little data in general about the value of outpatient transfusions. With no objective parameters to measure the benefits of red cell transfusions, a restrictive transfusion strategy may not be optimal for patients who require RBCT on a regular basis. Transfusions are ordered primarily based on haemoglobin concentrations and a subjective interpretation of symptoms of anaemia. Endpoints that may be more clinically relevant include quality of life measurements, vital signs, functional activity and cognition. To date, there has been little systematic assessment of tools that assess these measures and no published trials that have examined the impact of transfusions on functional outcomes in transfusion-dependent patients. Aims: The aim of this study is to understand how wearable devices and web-based testing can be used to measure physiological changes and functional activity in a cohort of transfusion-dependent patients. Methods: We monitored 5 patients who chronically receive transfusions during one transfusion cycle with the VitalPatch. and Withings Steel HR. Patients completed CANTAB cognitive tasks, QUALMS and PROMIS quality of life questionnaires through web-based testing. Outcomes were first the quality and usability of data. Second, we leveraged mixed models to evaluate transfusion-induced changes in 1) heart rate, 2) activity, 3) sustained attention, and 4) patient-reported quality of life. Results: Captured data was 97,8% high quality and usable for the VitalPatch; 98,9% for the Withings Steel HR. The sent out web-based CANTAB tasks and questionnaires were all completed on the appointed days. Heart rate and sustained attention are significantly and reversibly affected by RBC transfusions, corrected for predefined confounders (Fig. 1): Mean daytime heart rate was 76.5±2.8 bpm before and 72.3±2.8 after transfusion (P=0.002). Sustained attention (RVPA) increased from 8586±140 to 9141±183 after transfusion (P=0.004). Activity and quality of life measures did not yield transfusion-induced changes. The measured activity data may not be representative as the study was conducted during the COVID-19 induced lockdown.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring in daily life is essential for effective management of cardiovascular disease, a leading cause of death. Wearable ECG measurement systems in the form of clothing have been proposed to replace Holter monitors used for clinical ECG monitoring; however, they have limitations in daily use because they compress the upper body and, in doing so, cause discomfort during wear. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to develop a wireless wearable ECG monitoring system that includes a textile ECG electrode that can be applied to the lining of pants and can be used in the same way that existing lower clothing is worn, without compression to the upper body. METHODS: A textile electrode with stretchable characteristics was fabricated by knitting a conductive yarn together with polyester-polyurethane fiber, which was then coated with silver compound; an ECG electrode was developed by placing it on an elastic band in a modified limb lead configuration. In addition, a system with analog-to-digital conversion, wireless communication, and a smartphone app was developed, allowing users to be able to check and store their own ECGs in real time. A signal processing algorithm was also developed to remove noise from the obtained signal and to calculate the heart rate. To evaluate the ECG and heart rate measurement performance of the developed module, a comparative evaluation with a commercial device was performed. ECGs were measured for 5 minutes each in standing, sitting, and lying positions; the mean absolute percentage errors of heart rates measured with both systems were then compared. RESULTS: The system was developed in the form of a belt buckle with a size of 53 × 45 × 12 mm (width × height × depth) and a weight of 23 g. In a qualitative evaluation, it was confirmed that the P-QRS-T waveform was clearly observed in ECGs obtained with the wearable system. From the results of the heart rate estimation, the developed system could track changes in heart rate as calculated by a commercial ECG measuring device; in addition, the mean absolute percentage errors of heart rates were 1.80%, 2.84%, and 2.48% in the standing, sitting, and lying positions, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The developed system was able to effectively measure ECG and calculate heart rate simply through being worn as existing clothing without upper body pressure. It is anticipated that general usability can be secured through further evaluation under more diverse conditions.

N2  - Secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD), the leading cause of morbidity and mortality, is critical to improving health outcomes and quality of life in our aging population. As mobile health (mHealth) technology gains universal leverage and popularity, it is becoming more user-friendly for older adults and an adjunct to manage CVD risk and improve overall cardiovascular health. With the rapid advances in mHealth technology and increasing technological engagement of older adults, a comprehensive understanding of the current literature and knowledge of gaps and barriers surrounding the impact of mHealth on secondary CVD prevention is essential. After a systematic review of the literature, 26 studies that used mHealth for secondary CVD prevention focusing on lifestyle behavior change and medication adherence in cohorts with a mean age of ≥60 years were identified. Improvements in health behaviors and medication adherence were observed, particularly when there was a short message service (ie, texting) component involved. Although mobile technologies are becoming more mainstream and are starting to blend more seamlessly with standard health care, there are still distinct barriers that limit implementation particularly in older adults, including affordability, usability, privacy, and security issues. Furthermore, studies on the type of mHealth that is the most effective for older adults with longer study duration are essential as the field continues to grow. As our population ages, identifying and implementing effective, widely accepted, cost-effective, and time-efficient mHealth interventions to improve CVD health in a vulnerable demographic group should be a top health priority.

N2  - Objectives: Gout flares are painful and disabling. We developed a smartphone application (app) for patients to tele-monitor gout flares surveyed by clinicians. The aim of this study was to assess patient acceptability and technical and clinical feasibility. Methods: Adult patients with either established gout or high suspicion thereof were recruited if they possessed a smartphone and reported a recent arthritis attack. A smartphone application was used to identify gout flares by asking during 90 consecutive days: (1) what is your pain score (0-10); (2) are your joints warm; (3) are your joints swollen; and (4) are you currently experiencing a gout flare? The clinician was alerted via email if a flare occurred. Patient acceptability was assessed using the technology acceptance model. Technical feasibility consisted of reported technical issues and clinical feasibility of actions taken by the clinician regarding gout flare alerts. Results: Twenty-nine included patients completed the study. The mean age of participants was 57 years, and all but one were male. The adherence rate was 96% (110 of 2910 queries were missed). Patients had a positive attitude toward app use, found the app very easy to use (mean usability score 81 out of 100) and were neutral to positive on its usefulness. There were four minor technical issues. A total of 100 gout flare alerts were generated that led to 18 proactive contacts with patients. Conclusion: A smartphone app to monitor gout flares was developed and tested, showing high adherence, good acceptability and clinical feasibility for established gout patients.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Smart home and telemonitoring technologies have often been suggested to assist health care workers in supporting older people to age in place. However, there is limited research examining diverse information needs of different groups of health care workers and their access to appropriate information technologies. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the issues associated with using technologies that connect older people to their health care providers to support aging in place and enhance older people's health and well-being. METHODS: Seven focus group discussions were conducted comprising 44 health care professionals who provided clinic-based or in-home services to community-dwelling older people. Participants were asked about their information needs and how technology could help them support older people to age in place. The recordings of the sessions were transcribed and thematically analyzed. RESULTS: The perspectives varied between the respondents who worked in primary care clinics and those who worked in community-based services. Three overarching themes were identified. The first theme was "access to technology and systems," which examined the different levels of technology in use and the problems that various groups of health care professionals had in accessing information about their patients. Primary care professionals had access to good internal information systems but they experienced poor integration with other health care providers. The community-based teams had poor access to technology. The second theme was "collecting and sharing of information," which focused on how technology might be used to provide them with more information about their patients. Primary care teams were interested in telemonitoring for specific clinical indicators but they wanted the information to be preprocessed. Community-based teams were more concerned about gaining information on the patients' social environment. The third theme was that all respondents identified similar "barriers to uptake": cost and funding issues, usability of systems by older people, and information security and privacy concerns. CONCLUSIONS: The participants perceived the potential benefits of technologies, but they were concerned that the information they received should be preprocessed and integrated with current information systems and tailored to the older people's unique and changing situations. Several management and governance issues were identified, which needed to be resolved to enable the widespread integration of these technologies into the health care system. The disconnected nature of the current information architecture means that there is no clear way for sensor data from telemonitoring and smart home devices to be integrated with other patient information. Furthermore, cost, privacy, security, and usability barriers also need to be resolved. This study highlights the importance and the complexity of management and governance of systems to collect and disseminate such information. Further research into the requirements of all stakeholder groups and how the information can be processed and disseminated is required.

N2  - Pervasive health technologies can increase the effectiveness of personal health monitoring and training, but more user studies are necessary to understand the interest for these technologies, and how they should be designed and implemented. In the present study, we evaluated eWALL, a user-centered pervasive health technology consisting of a platform that monitors users’ physical and cognitive behavior, providing feedback and motivation via an easy-to-use, touch-based user interface. The eWALL was placed for one month in the home of 48 subjects with a chronic condition (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease—COPD or mild cognitive impairment—MCI) or with an age-related impairment. User acceptance, platform use, and potential clinical effects were evaluated using surveys, data logs, and clinical scales. Although some features of the platform need to be improved before reaching technical maturity and making a difference in patients’ lives, the real-life evaluation of eWALL has shown how some features may influence patients’ intention to use this promising technology. Furthermore, this study made it clear how the free use of different health apps is modulated by the real needs of the patient and by their usefulness in the context of the patient’s clinical status.

N2  - Purpose: Wearable devices are progressively becoming an available tool for continuous seizure detection. Motivation to use wearables is not only driven by the accuracy and reliability of the performance but also by the form factor, comfort, and stability on the body. We collected direct feedback and device placement-related issues experienced by a cohort of people with epilepsy (PWE) to investigate to what extent available devices are nonintrusive, comfortable, and stable on the body. Methods: Four models of wearable devices (E4 wrist band, Everion upper arm band, IMEC upper arm band, and Epilog scalp patch electrodes) were worn by PWE who were admitted to two epilepsy monitoring units (EMUs) in London and Freiburg. Participants were periodically reviewed, and accidental displacements of the devices were annotated. Participants' experience was assessed using the Technology Acceptance Model Fast Form (TAM-FF) plus two additional questions on comfort. A thematic analysis was also performed on the free text of the questionnaire. Results: One hundred and fifteen participants were enrolled. The devices had a good stability on the body including during seizures. Overall, all the devices were considered comfortable to be worn, including during sleep. However, devices containing wires and patches demonstrated a lesser degree of stability on the body and were judged less positively. Participants age was correlated with TAM-FF mean scores, and older participants judged the devices less favorably compared with younger participants. Discussion: Removable but securely fitted, wireless, and comfortable designs were considered more appropriate for a continuous monitoring aimed at seizure detection. Some caution may be required when patch electrodes and electrodes glued to the skin or to the scalp are used, as those evaluated in the present study demonstrated a lower level of acceptability and a lower degree of stability to the body, especially at night. These factors could limit a continuous monitoring decreasing the device performance for nocturnal, unsupervised seizures which are at higher risk of lethality.

N2  - Purpose: wearable devices aimed at detecting seizures are rapidly emerging. Continuous collection and optimal data quality are paramount to guarantee the acquisition of clinically meaningful data. It is still unknown how successfully patients can self-manage new technologies and which factors have an impact on this. We assessed the performance of patients managing a wrist-worn device. Method: patients wearing a wrist-worn device received a single training session to perform 5 tasks: (1) fitting the device correctly; (2) switching the device on and off; (3) charging the device on a daily basis; (4) pairing the device with a phone or tablet; (5) seeking assistance. Participants were then reviewed every 24 h and, at the end of the study, a Wearable technology Self-management Score (WSS) was calculated according to their performance in the different tasks (0–12). The association between WSS, seizure capture, demographics and clinical characteristics was analysed. Results: Thirty patients were included. The mean WSS score was 9.4 ± 2.1 points. The task more often performed inaccurately was pairing the device with a phone or tablet, followed by performing charging procedures. A strong association was found between WSS and seizure capture (p = 0.019), with higher scores strongly associated with more seizures captured. A WSS of ≥9 was the minimum value of WSS that allowed the device to record all the seizures. Number of AEDs and illness-perception related factors (perceived disease timeline and personal control) were significantly associated with WSS. Conclusions: Overall, participants demonstrated good performances in self-managing a wrist-worn device. Digital inequalities may extend to variations in how different individuals feel about their own disease and, consequently, manage the technology. These aspects should be addressed when technological solutions are delivered to users.

N2  - The prevalence of Heart Failure is growing exponentially in the last decades, particularly amongst older adults. Heart Failure is a chronic cardiovascular disease that demands self-care management and substantial healthcare resources. For that reason, it is highly associated with hospital readmissions and mortality. Due to increased hospitalization costs, excessive waiting times and lack of specialized healthcare professionals to follow-up this growing population, telemedicine and telemonitoring technologies have become the best solutions to support health providers in the disease management tasks. Telemonitoring technologies offer better and more comfortable care because the elderly do not have to leave the comfort of their home to interact with the doctors, giving and receiving daily feedbacks trough these new applications, wearables, and health care platforms. This paper provides a comprehensive review covering the current progress of research in telemedicine and telemonitoring and their applications to Heart Failure Management services. It presents SmartBEAT, which demonstrated during a pilot phase, a user adherence of 97% for three months. Furthermore, SmartBEAT plus, an improved solution, is described, and the system usability a technology acceptance will be evaluated through a pilot with 40 Heart Failure Patients, involving nurses and cardiologists.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are a primary cause of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes worldwide. For women at risk of hypertensive complications, guidelines recommend frequent surveillance of blood pressure and signs of preeclampsia. Clinic visits range from every 2 weeks to several times a week. Given the wide ubiquity of smartphones and computers in most countries and a growing attention for self-management, digital technologies, including mobile health (mHealth), constitute a promising component of monitoring (self-measured) blood pressure during pregnancy. Currently, little is known about the experiences of women using such platforms and how mHealth can be aligned with their needs and preferences. OBJECTIVE: The objectives were twofold: (1) to explore the experiences of Dutch women who had an increased risk of HDP with a blended care approach (mHealth combined with face-to-face care) for remote self-monitoring of blood pressure and preeclampsia symptoms and (2) to formulate recommendations for the use and integration of mHealth in clinical care. METHODS: Alongside a prospective blended care study (SAFE@home study) that monitors pregnant women at increased risk of HPD with mHealth technology, a mixed methods study was conducted, including questionnaires (n=52) and interviews (n=11). Results were analyzed thematically. RESULTS: Of the 4 themes, 2 themes were related to the technologies themselves (expectations, usability), and 2 themes were related to the interaction and use of mHealth (autonomy and responsibilities of patients, responsibilities of health care professionals). First, the digital platform met the expectations of patients, which contributed to user satisfaction. Second, the platform was considered user-friendly, and patients favored different moments and frequencies for measuring their blood pressure. Third, patient autonomy was mentioned in terms of increased insight about their own condition and being able to influence clinical decision making. Fourth, clinical expertise of health care professionals was considered essential to interpret the data, which translates to subsequent responsibilities for clinical management. Data from the questionnaires and interviews corresponded. CONCLUSIONS: Blended care using an mHealth tool to monitor blood pressure in pregnancy was positively evaluated by its users. Insights from participants led to 7 recommendations for designing and implementing similar interventions and to enhance future, morally sound use of digital technologies in clinical care.

N2  - Telediabetes may improve patient access to clinicians who specialize in the management of pediatric diabetes. Due to the diversity of telehealth modes, many different service models for pediatric telediabetes have been developed. This review describes pediatric telediabetes service models identified in the literature, investigates the reported changes in HbA1c of these interventions, and describes enablers and barriers to implementing a telediabetes service. Evaluation of current literature may inform the development and sustainability of telehealth services for pediatric diabetes management. Twenty-nine studies met inclusion criteria and were reviewed. This review has demonstrated that pediatric telediabetes can be delivered by remote monitoring and real-time videoconference modes. Overall, pediatric telediabetes increased interactions between patients and clinicians, improved access to specialized care, and facilitated increased diabetes monitoring. In some contexts, telediabetes also improved short-term glycemic control. Key enablers reported for telediabetes services were integration with existing workflows, dedicated staff, clinician and patient training, appropriate data security, technology with good usability, and the availability of technical support. Barriers included increases in patient responsibilities and clinician workload, and technical issues with equipment and software.

N2  - Little is known about the experiences and expectations of patients and health care professionals regarding continuous monitoring with these devices. Objective: This study aimed to identify positive and negative effects as well as barriers and facilitators for the use of two wearable devices: ViSi Mobile (VM) and HealthPatch (HP). Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, 90 patients admitted to the internal medicine and surgical wards of a university hospital in the Netherlands were randomly assigned to continuous vital sign monitoring using VM or HP and a control group. Users' experiences and expectations were addressed using semistructured interviews. Nurses, physician assistants, and medical doctors were also interviewed. Interviews were analyzed using thematic content analysis. Psychological distress was assessed using the State Trait Anxiety Inventory and the Pain Catastrophizing Scale. The System Usability Scale was used to assess the usability of both devices. Results: A total of 60 patients, 20 nurses, 3 physician assistants, and 6 medical doctors were interviewed. We identified 47 positive and 30 negative effects and 19 facilitators and 36 barriers for the use of VM and HP. Frequently mentioned topics included earlier identification of clinical deterioration, increased feelings of safety, and VM lines and electrodes. No differences related to psychological distress and usability were found between randomization groups or devices. Conclusions: Both devices were well received by most patients and health care professionals, and the majority of them encouraged the idea of monitoring vital signs continuously in the general ward. This comprehensive overview of barriers and facilitators of using wireless devices may serve as a guide for future researchers, developers, and health care institutions that consider implementing continuous monitoring in the ward.

N2  - Background: Due to demographic change and, more recently, coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the importance of modern intensive care units (ICU) is becoming apparent. One of the key components of an ICU is the continuous monitoring of patients' vital parameters. However, existing advances in informatics, signal processing, or engineering that could alleviate the burden on ICUs have not yet been applied. This could be due to the lack of user involvement in research and development. Objective: This study focused on the satisfaction of ICU staff with current patient monitoring and their suggestions for future improvements. We aimed to identify aspects of monitoring that interrupt patient care, display devices for remote monitoring, use cases for artificial intelligence (AI), and whether ICU staff members are willing to improve their digital literacy or contribute to the improvement of patient monitoring. We further aimed to identify differences in the responses of different professional groups. Methods: This survey study was performed with ICU staff from 4 ICUs of a German university hospital between November 2019 and January 2020. We developed a web-based 36-item survey questionnaire, by analyzing a preceding qualitative interview study with ICU staff, about the clinical requirements of future patient monitoring. Statistical analyses of questionnaire results included median values with their bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals, and chi-square tests to compare the distributions of item responses of the professional groups. Results: In total, 86 of the 270 ICU physicians and nurses completed the survey questionnaire. The majority stated they felt confident using the patient monitoring equipment, but that high rates of false-positive alarms and the many sensor cables interrupted patient care. Regarding future improvements, respondents asked for wireless sensors, a reduction in the number of false-positive alarms, and hospital standard operating procedures for alarm management. Responses to the display devices proposed for remote patient monitoring were divided. Most respondents indicated it would be useful for earlier alerting or when they were responsible for multiple wards. AI for ICUs would be useful for early detection of complications and an increased risk of mortality; in addition, the AI could propose guidelines for therapy and diagnostics. Transparency, interoperability, usability, and staff training were essential to promote the use of AI. The majority wanted to learn more about new technologies for the ICU and required more time for learning. Physicians had fewer reservations than nurses about AI-based intelligent alarm management and using mobile phones for remote monitoring. Conclusions: This survey study of ICU staff revealed key improvements for patient monitoring in intensive care medicine. Hospital providers and medical device manufacturers should focus on reducing false alarms, implementing hospital alarm standard operating procedures, introducing wireless sensors, preparing for the use of AI, and enhancing the digital literacy of ICU staff. Our results may contribute to the user-centered transfer of digital technologies into practice to alleviate challenges in intensive care medicine.

N2  - Background: Mobile health is a promising strategy aiming to anticipate and prevent the deterioration of health status in palliative cancer patients. A prerequisite for successful implementation of this technology into clinical routine is a high level of usability and acceptance of devices. Objectives: We aimed to evaluate feasibility as well as patients' acceptance of remote monitoring using wearables in palliative cancer patients. Methods: In this prospective single-center observational feasibility study, 30 cancer patients treated with palliative intent in an inpatient setting with an estimated life expectancy of >8 weeks and <12 months were provided with a smartphone including a pre-installed "Activity Monitoring" app and a sensor-equipped bracelet and monitored over a period of 12 weeks starting at discharge from hospital. We report detailed feasibility and usability aspects and comment on patients' acceptance of the wearables. Results: Between February 2017 and May 2018 a total of 30 patients were included in the study. From these, 25 participants (83%) completed the whole study period. On average, the bracelet was worn on 53% and smartphone used on 85% of the study days. The completion rate of daily digital questionnaires for subjective ratings (pain and distress scale) was 73%, and 28 patients were able to handle the wearables and to operate the app without major problems. Use of the bracelet was low during the night hours, with a wearing time of 1.7% of all night hours (8 p.m. to 8 a.m.). Conclusions: Remote monitoring of health care status in palliative cancer patients with a limited life expectancy is feasible and patients are able to handle the smartphone and the sensor-equipped bracelet. Feedback towards use of this monitoring system was mostly positive.

N2  - This article serves as the introduction to this special issue on Mobile Health and Mobile Rehabilitation for People with Disabilities. Social, technological and policy trends are reviewed. Needs, opportunities and challenges for the emerging fields of mobile health (mHealth, aka eHealth) and mobile rehabilitation (mRehab) are discussed. Healthcare in the United States (U.S.) is at a critical juncture characterized by: (1) a growing need for healthcare and rehabilitation services; (2) maturing technological capabilities to support more effective and efficient health services; (3) evolving public policies designed, by turns, to contain cost and support new models of care; and (4) a growing need to ensure acceptance and usability of new health technologies by people with disabilities and chronic conditions, clinicians and health delivery systems. Discussion of demographic and population health data, healthcare service delivery and a public policy primarily focuses on the U.S. However, trends identified (aging populations, growing prevalence of chronic conditions and disability, labor shortages in healthcare) apply to most countries with advanced economies and others. Furthermore, technologies that enable mRehab (wearable sensors, in-home environmental monitors, cloud computing, artificial intelligence) transcend national boundaries. Remote and mobile healthcare delivery is needed and inevitable. Proactive engagement is critical to ensure acceptance and effectiveness for all stakeholders.

N2  - Telemonitoring is a branch of telehealth that aims at remotely monitoring vital signs, which is important for chronically ill patients and the elderly living alone. The available standalone devices and applications for the self-monitoring of health parameters largely suffer from interoperability problems; meanwhile, telemonitoring medical devices are expensive, self-contained, and are not integrated into user-friendly technological platforms for the end user. This paper presents the technical aspects and usability assessment of the telemonitoring features of the HEREiAM platform, which supports heterogeneous information technology systems. By exploiting a service-oriented architecture, the measured parameters collected by off-the-shelf Bluetooth medical devices are sent as XML documents to a private cloud that implements an interoperable health service infrastructure, which is compliant with the most recent healthcare standards and security protocols. This Android-based system is designed to be accessible both via TV and portable devices, and includes other utilities designed to support the elderly living alone. Four usability assessment sessions with quality-validated questionnaires were performed to accurately understand the ease of use, usefulness, acceptance, and quality of the proposed system. The results reveal that our system achieved very high usability scores even at its first use, and the scores did not significantly change over time during a field trial that lasted for four months, reinforcing the idea of an intuitive design. At the end of such a trial, the user-experience questionnaire achieved excellent scores in all aspects with respect to the benchmark. Good results were also reported by general practitioners who assessed the quality of their remote interfaces for telemonitoring.
