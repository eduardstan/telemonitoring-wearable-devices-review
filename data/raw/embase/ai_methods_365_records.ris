N2  - Background: Continuous assessment and remote monitoring of cognitive function in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) enables tracking therapeutic effects and modifying treatment to achieve better clinical outcomes. While standardized neuropsychological tests are inconvenient for this purpose, wearable sensor technology collecting physiological and behavioral data looks promising to provide proxy measures of cognitive function. The objective of this study was to evaluate the predictive ability of digital physiological features, based on sensor data from wrist-worn wearables, in determining neuropsychological test scores in individuals with MCI. Methods: We used the dataset collected from a 10-week single-arm clinical trial in older adults (50–70 years old) diagnosed with amnestic MCI (N = 30) who received a digitally delivered multidomain therapeutic intervention. Cognitive performance was assessed before and after the intervention using the Neuropsychological Test Battery (NTB) from which composite scores were calculated (executive function, processing speed, immediate memory, delayed memory and global cognition). The Empatica E4, a wrist-wearable medical-grade device, was used to collect physiological data including blood volume pulse, electrodermal activity, and skin temperature. We processed sensors’ data and extracted a range of physiological features. We used interpolated NTB scores for 10-day intervals to test predictability of scores over short periods and to leverage the maximum of wearable data available. In addition, we used individually centered data which represents deviations from personal baselines. Supervised machine learning was used to train models predicting NTB scores from digital physiological features and demographics. Performance was evaluated using “leave-one-subject-out” and “leave-one-interval-out” cross-validation. Results: The final sample included 96 aggregated data intervals from 17 individuals. In total, 106 digital physiological features were extracted. We found that physiological features, especially measures of heart rate variability, correlated most strongly to the executive function compared to other cognitive composites. The model predicted the actual executive function scores with correlation r = 0.69 and intra-individual changes in executive function scores with r = 0.61. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrated that wearable-based physiological measures, primarily HRV, have potential to be used for the continuous assessments of cognitive function in individuals with MCI.

N2  - Background: Breakthrough cancer pain (BTCP) is primarily managed at home and can stem from physical exertion and emotional distress triggers. Beyond these triggers, the impact of ambient environment on pain occurrence and intensity has not been investigated. This study explores the impact of environmental factors on the frequency and severity of breakthrough cancer pain (BTCP) in the home context from the perspective of patients with advanced cancer and their primary family caregiver. Methods: A health monitoring system was deployed in the homes of patient and family caregiver dyads to collect self-reported pain events and contextual environmental data (light, temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, ambient noise.) Correlation analysis examined the relationship between environmental factors with: 1) individually reported pain episodes and 2) overall pain trends in a 24-hour time window. Machine learning models were developed to explore how environmental factors may predict BTCP episodes. Results: Variability in correlation strength between environmental variables and pain reports among dyads was found. Light and noise show moderate association (r = 0.50–0.70) in 66% of total deployments. The strongest correlation for individual pain events involved barometric pressure (r = 0.90); for pain trends over 24-hours the strongest correlations involved humidity (r = 0.84) and barometric pressure (r = 0.83). Machine learning achieved 70% BTCP prediction accuracy. Conclusion: Our study provides insights into the role of ambient environmental factors in BTCP and offers novel opportunities to inform personalized pain management strategies, remotely support patients and their caregivers in self-symptom management. This research provides preliminary evidence of the impact of ambient environmental factors on BTCP in the home setting. We utilized real-world data and correlation analysis to provide an understanding of the relationship between environmental factors and cancer pain which may be helpful to others engaged in similar work.

We employed our methodologies to handle and examine data from a sample of 100,000 patients afflicted with hypertension and heart disease, employing artificial intelligence algorithms. We utilized five machine-learning algorithms to enhance the accuracy of triage. Results: The RTOF approach has remarkable efficacy in a simulated telemedicine environment, with a triage accuracy rate of 98%. The Random Forest algorithm exhibited superior performance compared to the other approaches under scrutiny. The performance characteristics attained were an accuracy rate of 98%, a precision rate of 99%, a sensitivity rate of 98%, and a specificity rate of 100%. The findings show a significant improvement compared to the present triage methods. Conclusions: The efficiency of RTOF surpasses that of existing triage frameworks, showcasing its significant ability to enhance the quality and efficacy of telemedicine solutions. This work showcases substantial enhancements compared to existing triage approaches, while also providing a scalable approach to tackle hospital congestion and optimize resource allocation in real-time. The results of our study emphasize the capacity of RTOF to mitigate hospital overcrowding, expedite medical intervention, and enable the creation of adaptable telemedicine networks. This study highlights potential avenues for further investigation into the integration of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) with machine learning to develop cutting-edge medical technologies.

N2  - Pursuing high-performance conductive hydrogels is still hot topic in development of advanced flexible wearable devices. Herein, a tough, self-healing, adhesive double network (DN) conductive hydrogel (named as OSA-(Gelatin/PAM)-Ca, O-(G/P)-Ca) was prepared by bridging gelatin and polyacrylamide network with functionalized polysaccharide (oxidized sodium alginate, OSA) through Schiff base reaction. Thanks to the presence of multiple interactions (Schiff base bond, hydrogen bond, and metal coordination) within the network, the prepared hydrogel showed outstanding mechanical properties (tensile strain of 2800 % and stress of 630 kPa), high conductivity (0.72 S/m), repeatable adhesion performance and excellent self-healing ability (83.6 %/79.0 % of the original tensile strain/stress after self-healing). Moreover, the hydrogel-based sensor exhibited high strain sensitivity (GF = 3.66) and fast response time (<0.5 s), which can be used to monitor a wide range of human physiological signals. Based on this, excellent compression sensitivity (GF = 0.41 kPa−1 in the range of 90–120 kPa), a three-dimensional (3D) array of flexible sensor was designed to monitor the intensity of pressure and spatial force distribution. In addition, a gel-based wearable sensor was accurately classified and recognized ten types of gestures, achieving an accuracy rate of >96.33 % both before and after self-healing under three machine learning models (the decision tree, SVM, and KNN). This paper provides a simple method to prepare tough and self-healing conductive hydrogel as flexible multifunctional sensor devices for versatile applications in fields such as healthcare monitoring, human-computer interaction, and artificial intelligence.

N2  - As the burgeoning field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to permeate the fabric of healthcare, particularly in the realms of patient surveillance and telemedicine, a transformative era beckons. This manuscript endeavors to unravel the intricacies of recent AI advancements and their profound implications for reconceptualizing the delivery of medical care. Through the introduction of innovative instruments such as virtual assistant chatbots, wearable monitoring devices, predictive analytic models, personalized treatment regimens, and automated appointment systems, AI is not only amplifying the quality of care but also empowering patients and fostering a more interactive dynamic between the patient and the healthcare provider. Yet, this progressive infiltration of AI into the healthcare sphere grapples with a plethora of challenges hitherto unseen. The exigent issues of data security and privacy, the specter of algorithmic bias, the requisite adaptability of regulatory frameworks, and the matter of patient acceptance and trust in AI solutions demand immediate and thoughtful resolution .The importance of establishing stringent and far-reaching policies, ensuring technological impartiality, and cultivating patient confidence is paramount to ensure that AI-driven enhancements in healthcare service provision remain both ethically sound and efficient. In conclusion, we advocate for an expansion of research efforts aimed at navigating the ethical complexities inherent to a technology-evolving landscape, catalyzing policy innovation, and devising AI applications that are not only clinically effective but also earn the trust of the patient populace. By melding expertise across disciplines, we stand at the threshold of an era wherein AI's role in healthcare is both ethically unimpeachable and conducive to elevating the global health quotient.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: A modern and accessible healthcare system requires digital innovation and connectivity. The term "Digital health" covers vide range technologies, such as mobile health and applications, electronic records, telehealth and telemedicine, wearable devices, robotics, virtual reality and artificial intelligence. METHODS: Scientometrics is the method that we have done in this study by Cite Space and VOSviewer software, and the result of searching the Web of Science database in plain text format to perform analysis and scientometrics and create outputs in the form of graphs and tables in the field of digital health has been used in stroke rehabilitation. RESULT: A total of 2933 documents related to digital health technologies in stroke rehabilitation were identified by searching for the terms "stroke rehabilitation" or "stroke recovery" in the title and "digital health" across all fields. The strongest citations related to cerebrovascular disease spanned from 1994 to 2007, with randomised clinical trials occurring almost simultaneously and ended by 2012. Consequently, stroke rehabilitation by virtual reality technology has obtained the most citations and clinical trials and as an important part of digital health in the future research process. CONCLUSION: This scientometric study offers insights into how digital health technology can assist stroke patients in self-managing their health and well-being, in addition to supporting integrated stroke rehabilitation. The analysis revealed that three themes were present: author contributors and collaboration networks, temporal evolution, the strongest citation explosions for digital health technologies in stroke rehabilitation research, and semantic analysis.

N2  - The use of observed wearable sensor data (e.g., photoplethysmograms [PPG]) to infer health measures (e.g., glucose level or blood pressure) is a very active area of research. Such technology can have a significant impact on health screening, chronic disease management and remote monitoring. A common approach is to collect sensor data and corresponding labels from a clinical grade device (e.g., blood pressure cuff) and train deep learning models to map one to the other. Although well intentioned, this approach often ignores a principled analysis of whether the input sensor data have enough information to predict the desired metric. We analyze the task of predicting blood pressure from PPG pulse wave analysis. Our review of the prior work reveals that many papers fall prey to data leakage and unrealistic constraints on the task and preprocessing steps. We propose a set of tools to help determine if the input signal in question (e.g., PPG) is indeed a good predictor of the desired label (e.g., blood pressure). Using our proposed tools, we found that blood pressure prediction using PPG has a high multi-valued mapping factor of 33.2% and low mutual information of 9.8%. In comparison, heart rate prediction using PPG, a well-established task, has a very low multi-valued mapping factor of 0.75% and high mutual information of 87.7%. We argue that these results provide a more realistic representation of the current progress toward the goal of wearable blood pressure measurement via PPG pulse wave analysis.

N2  - The management of heart failure has undergone significant evolution, advancing from the initial utilization of digitalis and diuretics to the contemporary practice of personalized medicine and sophisticated device therapy. Despite these advancements, the persistent challenge of high hospitalization and readmission rates underscores an urgent need for innovative solutions. This manuscript explores how the integration of digital health technologies into interventional cardiology marks a paradigm shift in the management of heart failure. These technologies are no longer mere adjuncts but have become foundational to a modern approach, providing tools for continuous monitoring, patient education, and improved outcomes post-intervention. Through an examination of current trends, this perspective article highlights the transformative impact of wearable technologies, telehealth platforms, and advanced analytical tools in reshaping patient engagement and enabling proactive care strategies. Case studies illustrate the practical advantages, including enhanced medication adherence, early detection of heart failure signs, and a reduction in healthcare facility burdens. Central to this new digital health landscape is the Information Technology Management (ITM) system, a framework poised to revolutionize patient and caregiver engagement and pave the way for the future of interventional cardiology. This manuscript delineates the ITM system's innovative architecture and its consequential role in refining current and prospective cardiological interventions.

N2  - As Canada's population of older adults rises, the need for aging-in-place solutions is growing due to the declining quality of long-term-care homes and long wait times. While the current standards include questionnaire-based assessments for monitoring activities of daily living (ADLs), there is an urgent need for advanced indoor localization technologies that ensure privacy. This study explores the use of Ultra-Wideband (UWB) technology for activity recognition in a mock condo in the Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital. UWB systems with built-in Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors were tested, using anchors set up across the condo and a tag worn by patients. We tested various UWB setups, changed the number of anchors, and varied the tag placement (on the wrist or chest). Wrist-worn tags consistently outperformed chest-worn tags, and the nine-anchor configuration yielded the highest accuracy. Machine learning models were developed to classify activities based on UWB and IMU data. Models that included positional data significantly outperformed those that did not. The Random Forest model with a 4 s data window achieved an accuracy of 94%, compared to 79.2% when positional data were excluded. These findings demonstrate that incorporating positional data with IMU sensors is a promising method for effective remote patient monitoring.

By assessing important health factors like heart rate, blood pressure, pulse, temperature, activity level, weight management, respiration rate, medication adherence, sleep patterns, and oxygen levels, the suggested Remote Patient Monitor Model (RPMM) attains a noteworthy accuracy of 97.23%. The model's capacity to identify spatial and temporal relationships in health data is improved by novel techniques such as the use of CNN for spatial analysis and feature extraction and LSTM for temporal sequence modeling. Early intervention is made easier by this synergistic approach, which enhances trend identification and anomaly detection in vital signs. A variety of datasets are used to validate the model's robustness, highlighting its efficacy in remote patient care. This study shows how using ensemble models' advantages might improve health monitoring's precision and promptness, which would eventually benefit patients and ease the burden on healthcare systems.

N2  - The advent of digital health and artificial intelligence (AI) has promised to revolutionize clinical care, but real-world patient evaluation has yet to witness transformative changes. As history taking and physical examination continue to rely on long-established practices, a growing pipeline of AI-enhanced digital tools may soon augment the traditional clinical encounter into a data-driven process. This article presents an evidence-backed vision of how promising AI applications may enhance traditional practices, streamlining tedious tasks while elevating diverse data sources, including AI-enabled stethoscopes, cameras, and wearable sensors, to platforms for personalized medicine and efficient care delivery. Through the lens of traditional patient evaluation, we illustrate how digital technologies may soon be interwoven into routine clinical workflows, introducing a novel paradigm of longitudinal monitoring. Finally, we provide a skeptic's view on the practical, ethical, and regulatory challenges that limit the uptake of such technologies.

N2  - The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT)-based Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) systems provide real-time data and insights about patients' conditions without the need for constant physical visits to healthcare facilities. The wearable sensors are responsible for sensing the psychological vitals of humans at different intervals to detect their precise health status. This article introduces an Interfering Input Classification Model (IICM) for addressing the continuous and discrete data extraction issues in RPM. The proposed model hybridizes whale optimization and deep-Q-learning for classification and connectivity identification between different interval data. The sensed information is segregated as discrete and continuous using the search process termination of the whales. Such classified data is validated for the maximum discreteness and its interconnection between the previous sequences. This interconnection is performed using Q-learning based on different state changes through continuous clinical range correlations. The proposed model exemplifies continuous and discrete signals (data) for abnormality detection and diagnosis recommendation. Thus the proposed model is reliable in improving the classification ratio and accuracy with fewer errors. The experimental values of the proposed model are as follows: IICM enhances classification by 6.65%, signal identification by 6.63%, and classification accuracy by 10.08%. This model reduces classification time by 9.51% and error by 10.14% for different ranges of inputs.

N2  - The IoT (Internet of Things) has played a promising role in e-healthcare applications during the last decade. Medical sensors record a variety of data and transmit them over the IoT network to facilitate remote patient monitoring. When a patient visits a hospital he may need to connect or disconnect medical devices from the medical healthcare system frequently. Also, multiple entities (e.g., doctors, medical staff, etc.) need access to patient data and require distinct sets of patient data. As a result of the dynamic nature of medical devices, medical users require frequent access to data, which raises complex security concerns. Granting access to a whole set of data creates privacy issues. Also, each of these medical user need to grant access rights to a specific set of medical data, which is quite a tedious task. In order to provide role-based access to medical users, this study proposes a blockchain-based framework for authenticating multiple entities based on the trust domain to reduce the administrative burden. This study is further validated by simulation on the infura blockchain using solidity and Python. The results demonstrate that role-based authorization and multi-entities authentication have been implemented and the owner of medical data can control access rights at any time and grant medical users easy access to a set of data in a healthcare system. The system has minimal latency compared to existing blockchain systems that lack multi-entity authentication and role-based authorization.

N2  - Background: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death globally, with an estimated 18.6 million deaths in 2021. E-health interventions have the potential to improve CVD management by providing remote monitoring, patient education, and support. This updated systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to synthesize the evidence on the effectiveness of innovative e-health technologies for CVD treatment, including studies published up to November 2023. Objective: This updated systematic review and meta-analysis aims to analyze the evidence that innovative e-health technologies are proven to be effective in improving CVD management. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, and PsycINFO from inception to November 2023. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing an innovative e-health technology to usual care or another intervention in adults with CVD or at risk of CVD were included. Studies not meeting these criteria were excluded. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool. A meta-analysis was conducted for outcomes with sufficient studies and similar interventions and outcomes. For other outcomes, a narrative synthesis was performed. The certainty of evidence for each outcome was assessed using the GRADE approach. Results: Forty-four RCTs met the inclusion criteria, with a total of 11,872 participants. The interventions included artificial intelligence, machine learning, wearable devices, mobile health, telehealth, virtual reality, augmented reality, blockchain technology, Internet of Things (IoT), and big data analytics. The outcomes included blood pressure, cholesterol levels, medication adherence, cardiovascular events, and quality of life. Conclusions: The meta-analysis showed that innovative e-health technologies were effective in improving blood pressure (mean difference: -5.7 mmHg; 95% CI: -7.3 to - 4.1), cholesterol levels (mean difference: -10.8 mg/dL; 95% CI: -13.9 to -7.7), and medication adherence (odds ratio: 1.48; 95% CI: 1.31 to 1.67). The certainty of evidence for these outcomes was moderate. The narrative synthesis showed that innovative e-health technologies were also effective in reducing cardiovascular events and improving quality of life. However, the evidence for these outcomes was limited, and more research is needed.

N2  - Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic has spurred a growing demand for telemedicine. Artificial intelligence and image processing systems with wireless transmission functionalities can facilitate remote care for otitis media (OM). Accordingly, this study developed and validated an algorithm-driven tele-otoscope system equipped with Wi-Fi transmission and a cloud-based automatic OM diagnostic algorithm. Study Design: Prospective, cross-sectional, diagnostic study. Setting: Tertiary Academic Medical Center. Methods: We designed a tele-otoscope (Otiscan, SyncVision Technology Corp) equipped with digital imaging and processing modules, Wi-Fi transmission capabilities, and an automatic OM diagnostic algorithm. A total of 1137 otoscopic images, comprising 987 images of normal cases and 150 images of cases of acute OM and OM with effusion, were used as the dataset for image classification. Two convolutional neural network models, trained using our dataset, were used for raw image segmentation and OM classification. Results: The tele-otoscope delivered images with a resolution of 1280 × 720 pixels. Our tele-otoscope effectively differentiated OM from normal images, achieving a classification accuracy rate of up to 94% (sensitivity, 80%; specificity, 96%). Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that the developed tele-otoscope has acceptable accuracy in diagnosing OM. This system can assist health care professionals in early detection and continuous remote monitoring, thus mitigating the consequences of OM.

N2  - The rapid growth in computational power, sensor technology, and wearable devices has provided a solid foundation for all aspects of cardiac arrhythmia care. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been instrumental in bringing about significant changes in the prevention, risk assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of arrhythmia. This review examines the current state of AI in the diagnosis and treatment of atrial fibrillation, supraventricular arrhythmia, ventricular arrhythmia, hereditary channelopathies, and cardiac pacing. Furthermore, ChatGPT, which has gained attention recently, is addressed in this paper along with its potential applications in the field of arrhythmia. Additionally, the accuracy of arrhythmia diagnosis can be improved by identifying electrode misplacement or erroneous swapping of electrode position using AI. Remote monitoring has expanded greatly due to the emergence of contactless monitoring technology as wearable devices continue to develop and flourish. Parallel advances in AI computing power, ChatGPT, availability of large data sets, and more have greatly expanded applications in arrhythmia diagnosis, risk assessment, and treatment. More precise algorithms based on big data, personalized risk assessment, telemedicine and mobile health, smart hardware and wearables, and the exploration of rare or complex types of arrhythmia are the future direction.

N2  - Background: Fatal coronary heart disease (FCHD) is often described as sudden cardiac death (affects >4 million people/year), where coronary artery disease is the only identified condition. Electrocardiographic artificial intelligence (ECG-AI) models for FCHD risk prediction using ECG data from wearable devices could enable wider screening/monitoring efforts. Objectives: To develop a single-lead ECG–based deep learning model for FCHD risk prediction and assess concordance between clinical and Apple Watch ECGs. Methods: An FCHD single-lead (“lead I” from 12-lead ECGs) ECG-AI model was developed using 167,662 ECGs (50,132 patients) from the University of Tennessee Health Sciences Center. Eighty percent of the data (5-fold cross-validation) was used for training and 20% as a holdout. Cox proportional hazards (CPH) models incorporating ECG-AI predictions with age, sex, and race were also developed. The models were tested on paired clinical single-lead and Apple Watch ECGs from 243 St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study participants. The correlation and concordance of the predictions were assessed using Pearson correlation (R), Spearman correlation (ρ), and Cohen's kappa. Results: The ECG-AI and CPH models resulted in AUC = 0.76 and 0.79, respectively, on the 20% holdout and AUC = 0.85 and 0.87 on the Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist external validation data. There was moderate-strong positive correlation between predictions (R = 0.74, ρ = 0.67, and κ = 0.58) when tested on the 243 paired ECGs. The clinical (lead I) and Apple Watch predictions led to the same low/high-risk FCHD classification for 99% of the participants. CPH prediction correlation resulted in an R = 0.81, ρ = 0.76, and κ = 0.78. Conclusion: Risk of FCHD can be predicted from single-lead ECGs obtained from wearable devices and are statistically concordant with lead I of a 12-lead ECG.

N2  - Background: Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients typically involves the collection of Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) via apps, wearables and sometimes blood self-sampling. An objective measure of joint swelling via the previously reported automated detection of dorsal finger fold patterns from hand photographs, could enhance RPM accuracy in RA. Objectives: To test the quality of automated detection of finger joint swelling based on finger fold recognition in sequentially taken hand photos of RA patients during regular rheumatology consultations. Methods: We utilized various image recognition models (Canny Edge Detection, Ridge Detection) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on photos of 1,783 Proximal Interphalangeal (PIP) joints from RA patients. After keypoint detection in hand photos via MediaPipe, PIP joints were isolated for further analysis. The CNN, trained on an additional 151 PIP images using LinkNet and Python 3.10, helped quantify finger folds and PIP joint diameters at the pixel level. The Finger Fold Index (FFI) was calculated as the ratio of joint diameter to the mean pixel length of detected finger folds. We analyzed 74 smartphone images (iPhone 6 camera without flash) of 17 RA patients taken in ≥2 regular consultations at a Swiss Academic Center. Active disease in at least one visit with congruent hand imaging as well as recorded swollen and tender joint counts and DAS28-CRP scores were required. We describe misclassifications based on algorithm steps (cropping, diameter, folds, image quality) or clinical data. Results: Only PIP2-4 joints were suitable for analysis due to oblique positioning of digits 1 and 5. The algorithm initially captured 222 PIP joints. Of those, 32% were optimally processed in terms of cropping, diameter, and finger fold recognition. The main reason for misclassifications were poor image quality leading to suboptimal cropping (9%), diameter recognition (18%), and incorrect finger fold identification (5%). In 15% of joints, the algorithm failed to provide results. For FFI correlation with joint swelling and DAS28- CRP evolution, seven patients (mean age 53, range 27-70) where monitored across 18 visits, yielding 31 hand images (either one or both hands). The average FFIs were 2.3 (index finger), 2.1 (middle finger), and 2.4 (ring finger). In 71% of patients (5 out of 7), the FFI correlated with disease progression as indicated by DAS28-CRP changes or swollen joint count. One of the most common confounding factors affecting the FFI was the reappearance of small finger folds after the swelling subsided, which inaccurately inflated the FFI measurements. In repeated analyses of healthy hand images, we found that light conditions (flash yes/no, sufficient light), positioning of the camera (maintaining a vertical perspective/deviating from a strictly overhead position). Conclusion: Longitudinal finger fold recognition and FFI measurement in a real-world setting shows consistent results with DAS28-CRP and or swelling and pain on a single joint level. Insufficient image quality was an important cause for misinterpretation in this real-world setting. Improved quality via the use of flash, photo boxes and further training of the algorithm may lead to a higher accuracy for the detection of disease flares or resolution, whereas the DAS28 may not be the ideal gold standard for joint swelling. .

N2  - Background: This study attempted to address limitations in the A-PROACCT model developed by Stein et al. (JOP, 2023) to predict the rate of acute care events within 30 days (ACE30) of initial chemotherapy administration (ICA). The four most important predictors were drug category (immunotherapy), cancer type (gastrointestinal), age group (< 40), and BMI category (underweight). Only linear relationships were considered. For patients for whom an ACE30 was predicted by their first and second models, only 0.18 and 0.23 actually had an ACE30, a low positive predictive value (PPV). We attempted to improve the PPV with advanced modeling techniques. Methods: Using Orlando Health data between February of 2012 and April 2021, random sampling was used to split the dataset into training (10,838) and validation (4645). For the training data, resampling was employed to obtain a balanced quota, equal observations followed by an ACE30 and not followed by an ACE30. We included only variables used in Stein (drug category, age group, ED visits and hospitalizations in the prior year, cancer type, insurance category, number of anti-cancer agents, race, and BMI category). Logistic regression with L1-penalty, XGBoost (a non-linear nonparametric tree-based algorithm to account for nonlinear relationships), and artificial neural networks were used to develop and evaluate predictive models. Different sampling methods (bootstrap and SMOTE) as well as cuff-off thresholds for high-risk groups were tested. Results: Based on evaluation with validation data set, the best performing approach was an XGBoost model with SMOTE resampling in the training data. The four most important predictors were ED visits in the prior year, payor category (self-insured), cancer type (genitourinary) and hospitalization in past year. This model reported a PPV of 0.27. Many other combinations of methodologies described above were performed, and the PPV varied between 0.19 to 0.27. Of the 282 ICAs identified as high-risk by the best model, 76 (27.0%) had an ACE30. Of the 4346 ICAs identified as low-risk, 533 (12.3%) had an ACE30. The differences between high risk and low risk ACE30 rates were statistically significant (p < 0.0001). In comparison, using Stein et al. models with our data reported a PPV of 0.27 and 0.25 which are basically at the same level of our best trained model. Conclusions: Using the variables included in A-PROACCT and a variety of machine learning models, advanced sampling methodologies and threshold cut-off limits, the best results were similar to those obtained using basic logistic regression. This suggests improvement in predicting acute care events following chemotherapy administration need to incorporate more extensive multimodal data, such as vital signs, performance status, patient reported outcomes, socioeconomic factors, laboratory and radiology results, remote patient monitoring and wearable device data.

N2  - Categorizing Artificial Intelligence of Medical Things (AIoMT) devices within the realm of standard Internet of Things (IoT) and Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices, particularly at the server and computational layers, poses a formidable challenge. In this paper, we present a novel methodology for categorizing AIoMT devices through the application of decentralized processing, referred to as "Federated Learning" (FL). Our approach involves deploying a system on standard IoT devices and labeled IoMT devices for training purposes and attribute extraction. Through this process, we extract and map the interconnected attributes from a global federated cum aggression server. The aim of this terminology is to extract interdependent devices via federated learning, ensuring data privacy and adherence to operational policies. Consequently, a global training dataset repository is coordinated to establish a centralized indexing and synchronization knowledge repository. The categorization process employs generic labels for devices transmitting medical data through regular communication channels. We evaluate our proposed methodology across a variety of IoT, IoMT, and AIoMT devices, demonstrating effective classification and labeling. Our technique yields a reliable categorization index for facilitating efficient access and optimization of medical devices within global servers.

N2  - Obstructive sleep apnea is a common type of sleep-disordered breathing associated with multiple comorbidities. Nearly a billion people are estimated to have obstructive sleep apnea, which carries a substantial economic burden, but under-diagnosis is still a problem. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the first-line treatment for OSAS. Telemedicine-based interventions (TM) have been evaluated to improve access to diagnosis, increase CPAP adherence, and contribute to easing the follow-up process, allowing healthcare facilities to provide patient-centered care. This narrative review summarizes the evidence available regarding the potential future of telemedicine in the management pathway of OSA. The potential of home sleep studies to improve OSA diagnosis and the importance of remote monitoring for tracking treatment adherence and failure and to contribute to developing patient engagement tools will be presented. Further studies are needed to explore the impact of shifting from teleconsultations to collaborative care models where patients are placed at the center of their care.

N2  - Background: The aging population is steadily increasing, posing new challenges and opportunities for healthcare systems worldwide. Technological advancements, particularly in commercially available Active Assisted Living devices, offer a promising alternative. These readily accessible products, ranging from smartwatches to home automation systems, are often equipped with Artificial Intelligence capabilities that can monitor health metrics, predict adverse events, and facilitate a safer living environment. However, there is no review exploring how Artificial Intelligence has been integrated into commercially available Active Assisted Living technologies, and how these devices monitor health metrics and provide healthcare solutions in a real-world environment for healthy aging. This review is essential because it fills a knowledge gap in understanding AI's integration in Active Assisted Living technologies in promoting healthy aging in real-world settings, identifying key issues that require to be addressed in future studies. Objective: The aim of this overview is to outline current understanding, identify potential research opportunities, and highlight research gaps from published studies regarding the use of Artificial Intelligence in commercially available Active Assisted Living technologies that assists older individuals aging at home. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted in six databases—PubMed, CINAHL, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, ACM Digital Library, and Web of Science—to identify relevant studies published over the past decade from 2013 to 2024. Our methodology adhered to the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews to ensure rigor and transparency throughout the review process. After applying predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria on 825 retrieved articles, a total of 64 papers were included for analysis and synthesis. Results: Several trends emerged from our analysis of the 64 selected papers. A majority of the work (39/64, 61%) was published after the year 2020. Geographically, most of the studies originated from East Asia and North America (36/64, 56%). The primary application goal of Artificial Intelligence in the reviewed literature was focused on activity recognition (34/64, 53%), followed by daily monitoring (10/64, 16%). Methodologically, tree-based and neural network-based approaches were the most prevalent Artificial Intelligence algorithms used in studies (32/64, 50% and 31/64, 48% respectively). A notable proportion of the studies (32/64, 50%) carried out their research using specially designed smart home testbeds that simulate the conditions in real-world. Moreover, ambient technology was a common thread (49/64, 77%), with occupancy-related data (such as motion and electrical appliance usage logs) and environmental sensors (indicators like temperature and humidity) being the most frequently used. Conclusion: Our results suggest that Artificial Intelligence has been increasingly deployed in the real-world Active Assisted Living context over the past decade, offering a variety of applications aimed at healthy aging and facilitating independent living for the older adults. A wide range of smart home indicators were leveraged for comprehensive data analysis, exploring and enhancing the potentials and effectiveness of solutions. However, our review has identified multiple research gaps that need further investigation. First, most research has been conducted in controlled testbed environments, leaving a lack of real-world applications that could validate the technologies' efficacy and scalability. Second, there is a noticeable absence of research leveraging cloud technology, an essential tool for large-scale deployment and standardized data collection and management. Future work should prioritize these areas to maximize the potential benefits of Artificial Intelligence in Active Assisted Living settings.

N2  - This research addresses the problem of detecting acute respiratory, urinary tract, and other infectious diseases in elderly nursing home residents using machine learning algorithms. The study analyzes data extracted from multiple vital signs and other contextual information for diagnostic purposes. The daily data collection process encounters sampling constraints due to weekends, holidays, shift changes, staff turnover, and equipment breakdowns, resulting in numerous nulls, repeated readings, outliers, and meaningless values. The short time series generated also pose a challenge to analysis, preventing the extraction of seasonal information or consistent trends. Blind data collection results in most of the data coming from periods when residents are healthy, resulting in excessively imbalanced data. This study proposes a data cleaning process and then builds a mechanism that reproduces the basal activity of the residents to improve the classification of the disease. The results show that the proposed basal module-assisted machine learning techniques allow anticipating diagnostics 2, 3 or 4 days before doctors decide to start treatment with antibiotics, achieving a performance measured by the area-under-the-curve metric of 0.857. The contributions of this work are: (1) a new data cleaning process; (2) the analysis of contextual information to improve data quality; (3) the generation of a baseline measure for relative comparison; and (4) the use of either binary (disease/no disease) or multiclass classification, differentiating among types of infections and showing the advantages of multiclass versus binary classification. From a medical point of view, the anticipated detection of infectious diseases in institutionalized individuals is brand new.

N2  - Background: Maternal mortality and morbidity is a major problem worldwide. Preeclampsia (PreEc) and peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) are two major maternal adverse events, both associated with elevated N-terminal (NT) brain natriuretic peptide (proBNP). Recent studies suggest that PreEC, PPCM, and elevated NT-proBNP can be detected from ECG-alone using artificial intelligence (AI). Objective: To develop a mobile application capable of directly receive waveform ECG from point of care (POC) ECG devices and ECG-enabled wearables with automated calculation of risk for PreEc, PPCM, and elevated NT-proBNP. Methods: We previously developed and validated deep learning based ECG-AI models for PreEc (AUC of 0.81), PPCM (AUC 0.94), and elevated NT-proBNP (AUC of 0.93 for NT-proBNP>500pg/ml) risk predictions. In this project, we developed an IOS application, “air-MONICA” (MOthers Need Innovative CAre), which can receive ECG data from clinical ECGs or Apple Watches, and automatically execute ECG-AI models for calculation of PreEC, PPCM, and NT-proBNP risk locally on supported IOS devices. Results: air-Monica was developed for POC use (Figure A) and remote monitoring (Figure B). air-MONICA POC system was able to retrieve 12 leads 10 seconds waveform ECG directly from GE MAC5 machine at 500Hz sampling frequency via a cloud server, send it to air-MONICA app at an IOS device at POC, and run ECG-AI models locally on an IOS device (iPad) for PreEC, PPCM, and elevated NT-proBNP risk, and presents results in <10 seconds. air-MONICA remote monitoring app was able to export single lead 30 seconds waveform ECG data at 512Hz from Apple Watch, move it to air-MONICA app on an iPhone 13 Pro via Bluetooth, run ECG-AI models locally on the phone, and present results in <2 seconds. Conclusion: ECG-AI holds promise for timely detection of adverse maternal events to reduce maternal mortality and morbidity in the US and elsewhere at low cost. [Formula presented]

N2  - Human activity recognition (HAR) technology enables continuous behavior monitoring, which is particularly valuable in healthcare. This study investigates the viability of using an ear-worn motion sensor for classifying daily activities, including lying, sitting/standing, walking, ascending stairs, descending stairs, and running. Fifty healthy participants (between 20 and 47 years old) engaged in these activities while under monitoring. Various machine learning algorithms, ranging from interpretable shallow models to state-of-the-art deep learning approaches designed for HAR (i.e., DeepConvLSTM and ConvTransformer), were employed for classification. The results demonstrate the ear sensor's efficacy, with deep learning models achieving a 98% accuracy rate of classification. The obtained classification models are agnostic regarding which ear the sensor is worn and robust against moderate variations in sensor orientation (e.g., due to differences in auricle anatomy), meaning no initial calibration of the sensor orientation is required. The study underscores the ear's efficacy as a suitable site for monitoring human daily activity and suggests its potential for combining HAR with in-ear vital sign monitoring. This approach offers a practical method for comprehensive health monitoring by integrating sensors in a single anatomical location. This integration facilitates individualized health assessments, with potential applications in tele-monitoring, personalized health insights, and optimizing athletic training regimes.

N2  - Background The diagnosis of heart failure (HF) remains a challenging task, even for experienced HF specialists. Leveraging Artificial Intelligence with Electrocardiogram (ECG-AI) holds great promise to aid in the diagnostic process in HF. The primary objective of this research was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of an AI model when applied to Lead I ECG data alone, thus simulating the capabilities of wearable ECG technology, in the context of HF identification. Methods We employed an extensive University of Tennessee Health Science Center (UTHSC) EHR dataset featuring 202,945 ECGs from 77,769 patients, including 16,643 identified with heart failure based on ICD codes. This dataset was partitioned into three segments (75% for training, 15% for validation, and 10% for internal holdout). Our deep learning model was meticulously constructed on the training set and fine-tuned on the validation set. The validation set facilitated the determination of the optimal threshold (0.37) for converting predicted probabilities into binary outcomes. Additionally, to explore the concordance of the HF model's predictions, we collected simultaneous paired ECGs from 243 volunteers, encompassing both clinical and Apple Watch ECGs, facilitated by our iOS app. Results The model exhibited robust and comparable performance, achieving an AUC of 0.89 [0.89-0.9], sensitivity and specificity of 0.81 [0.81-0.82], when using only Lead I ECG data in the test set. In addition, the analysis of model prediction concordance revealed a strong correlation (Pearson coefficient of 0.6, p<0.001). Utilizing the determined threshold value, we found that 89% of the ECGs were classified into the same category. Conclusion This research underscores the potential of ECG-AI in detecting heart failure using Lead I ECG data, simulating wearable monitoring. Strong performance and optimal thresholds enable cost-effective remote HF identification. Concordance between clinical and Apple Watch ECGs supports remote monitoring. Clinical validation and real-world implementation are essential for realizing these benefits fully.

N2  - Objective: The SmartPatch (Alio, Inc.) was cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March of 2023 as a wearable device to non-invasively assess heart rate, skin temperature, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and as a qualitative indicator of abnormal potassium levels. The device also has a microphone that is directly in contact with an arteriovenous (AV) access, simultaneously collecting a 15-second, reviewable acoustic recording of the AV access. We sought to develop an automated, machine-learning method of analyzing the acoustic sample. Methods: Twenty-eight patients were enrolled in an Institutional Review Boards-approved study of hemodialysis patients undergoing planned endovascular interventions on their access. A device was placed over the access site prior to the procedure. A second control device was placed on the lower leg. Five minutes of data collection was performed pre- and post-procedure. The raw data was processed using signal processing, feature extraction, and predictive algorithms. Results: A total of 692 reads from 28 subjects were analyzed: 316 reads were from the AV access, and 376 were from the leg. The prediction algorithm was evaluated for the ability to distinguish reads with a periodic acoustic signal from those without. Pooled sensitivity of 79.3% was achieved for all participants. Pooled specificity of 95.3% was achieved for all participants. Conclusion: The device successfully demonstrated the ability to identify the presence of a periodic acoustic signal consistent with a bruit in an AV access. This study provides an early demonstration of a scalable, automated method of remotely monitoring hemodialysis patients with an AV access. In conjunction with the device’s FDA-cleared potassium indicator, this novel technology may provide an objective solution for the remote detection of a functioning or dysfunctional AV access. Further studies are required to investigate the clinical implications of this new technology.

N2  - BACKGROUND: This study used electrocardiogram data in conjunction with artificial intelligence methods as a noninvasive tool for detecting peripartum cardiomyopathy. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the efficacy of an artificial intelligence-based heart failure detection model for peripartum cardiomyopathy detection. STUDY DESIGN: We first built a deep-learning model for heart failure detection using retrospective data at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center. Cases were adult and nonpregnant female patients with a heart failure diagnosis; controls were adult nonpregnant female patients without heart failure. The model was then tested on an independent cohort of pregnant women at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center with or without peripartum cardiomyopathy. We also tested the model in an external cohort of pregnant women at Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist. Key outcomes were assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. We also repeated our analysis using only lead I electrocardiogram as an input to assess the feasibility of remote monitoring via wearables that can capture single-lead electrocardiogram data. RESULTS: The University of Tennessee Health Science Center heart failure cohort comprised 346,339 electrocardiograms from 142,601 patients. In this cohort, 60% of participants were Black and 37% were White, with an average age (standard deviation) of 53 (19) years. The heart failure detection model achieved an area under the curve of 0.92 on the holdout set. We then tested the ability of the heart failure model to detect peripartum cardiomyopathy in an independent University of Tennessee Health Science Center cohort of pregnant women and an external Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist cohort of pregnant women. The independent University of Tennessee Health Science Center cohort included 158 electrocardiograms from 115 patients; our deep-learning model achieved an area under the curve of 0.83 (0.77–0.89) for this data set. The external Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist cohort involved 80 electrocardiograms from 43 patients; our deep-learning model achieved an area under the curve of 0.94 (0.91–0.98) for this data set. For identifying peripartum cardiomyopathy diagnosed ≥10 days after delivery, the model achieved an area under the curve of 0.88 (0.81–0.94) for the University of Tennessee Health Science Center cohort and of 0.96 (0.93–0.99) for the Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist cohort. When we repeated our analysis by building a heart failure detection model using only lead-I electrocardiograms, we obtained similarly high detection accuracies, with areas under the curve of 0.73 and 0.93 for the University of Tennessee Health Science Center and Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist cohorts, respectively. CONCLUSION: Artificial intelligence can accurately detect peripartum cardiomyopathy from electrocardiograms alone. A simple electrocardiographic artificial intelligence–based peripartum screening could result in a timelier diagnosis. Given that results with 1-lead electrocardiogram data were similar to those obtained using all 12 leads, future studies will focus on remote screening for peripartum cardiomyopathy using smartwatches that can capture single-lead electrocardiogram data.

N2  - Patients with advanced heart failure, due to the instability of their clinical conditions, need close surveillance to avoid dangerous exacerbations or sudden events. Digital technology can be of great help in this contest, thanks to remote monitoring, made possible with the use of wearable or implantable instruments. The latter are currently generally inserted inside defibrillators or resynchronization systems, or inserted inside the pulmonary circulation for monitoring pulmonary pressure. Parameters such as thoracic impedance, physical activity, heart rate variability, atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, blood pressure, and O2 saturation can be controlled remotely. The data relating to the actual benefit in terms of avoidable events (death and hospitalizations) are not definitive, but certainly from an organizational point of view, the benefit is evident, both on the part of the patient and of the organization of care. The latter, provided in the form of televisits, requires a re-modulation of the system, making use of trained personnel, a well- structured network, and digital technologies (platforms, electronic health records) that are not yet perfectly developed. The evolution of the solutions offered by artificial intelligence guarantees a rapid and progressive refinement of telemedicine in this sector.

N2  - The present article underscored the indispensable significance of end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) monitoring in anesthesia and critical care, offering critical insights into both ventilation and metabolism dynamics. The meticulous management of tidal volume, respiratory rate, and inspired oxygen levels during anesthesia plays a pivotal role in maintaining optimal arterial oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations. Effective ventilation is imperative for proper gas exchange within the alveoli and maintaining a stable acid-base balance. In the context of circulatory physiology during anesthesia, cardiac output, blood pressure, and tissue perfusion hold paramount importance. The present article highlights how anesthesia-induced alterations in vascular tone and cardiac function could influence circulation and tissue oxygenation, impacting parameters like blood pressure, heart rate, and ETCO2. Monitoring these parameters provides essential data for assessing circulatory status, guiding anesthesia management, and averting complications. ETCO2 monitoring has evolved into a standard practice in anesthesia and critical care settings, offering real-time, non-invasive insights. The present article delved into the extensive clinical applications, challenges, and future directions of ETCO2 monitoring. Encompassing fundamental principles, technological nuances, clinical implications, limitations, and avenues for research, this article advanced the understanding of this monitoring technique and its positive impact on patient care. The present article also discussed how ETCO2 levels reflect alveolar ventilation, providing critical data for assessing ventilation adequacy, readiness for extubation, and identification of impending respiratory distress. Furthermore, it delved into how ETCO2 levels serve as an indicator of cardiac output and tissue perfusion, guiding management strategies in various shock states and offering prognostic insights during CPR. Challenges and limitations associated with ETCO2 monitoring were clarified, with emphasis on technical considerations, patient populations with specific challenges, and potential interpretation pitfalls. The article outlines the exciting future directions of ETCO2 monitoring, encompassing wearable technology, remote monitoring capabilities, artificial intelligence integration, and potential applications beyond traditional realms.

N2  - Noncommunicable diseases (NCD), such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, are defining healthcare challenges of the 21st century. Medical infrastructure, which for decades sought to reduce the incidence and severity of communicable diseases, has proven insufficient in meeting the intensive, long-term monitoring needs of many NCD disease patient groups. In addition, existing portable devices with rigid electronics are still limited in clinical use due to unreliable data, limited functionality, and lack of continuous measurement ability. Here, a wearable system for at-home cardiovascular monitoring of postpartum women-a group with urgently unmet NCD needs in the United States-using a cloud-integrated soft sternal device with conformal nanomembrane sensors is introduced. A supporting mobile application provides device data to a custom cloud architecture for real-time waveform analytics, including medical device-grade blood pressure prediction via deep learning, and shares the results with both patient and clinician to complete a robust and highly scalable remote monitoring ecosystem. Validated in a month-long clinical study with 20 postpartum Black women, the system demonstrates its ability to remotely monitor existing disease progression, stratify patient risk, and augment clinical decision-making by informing interventions for groups whose healthcare needs otherwise remain unmet in standard clinical practice.

N2  - The remote monitoring of vital signs and healthcare provision has become an urgent necessity due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the world. Blood oxygen level, heart rate, and body temperature data are crucial for managing the disease and ensuring timely medical care. This study proposes a low-cost wearable device employing non-contact sensors to monitor, process, and visualize critical variables, focusing on body temperature measurement as a key health indicator. The wearable device developed offers a non-invasive and continuous method to gather wrist and forehead temperature data. However, since there is a discrepancy between wrist and actual forehead temperature, this study incorporates statistical methods and machine learning to estimate the core forehead temperature from the wrist. This research collects 2130 samples from 30 volunteers, and both the statistical least squares method and machine learning via linear regression are applied to analyze these data. It is observed that all models achieve a significant fit, but the third-degree polynomial model stands out in both approaches. It achieves an R2 value of 0.9769 in the statistical analysis and 0.9791 in machine learning.

N2  - Today's the blend of information technology and medicine has been improved patient's life. People can monitor their health status without the aid of a healthcare specialized; healthcare is now ubiquitous and don't limit in the waiting room. Unfortunately, there are rarely worked done on women's healthcare, especially pregnancy healthcare monitoring. In this research, a number of articles that have been specially presented about new measurement systems for daily life and health monitoring systems for pregnant women are investigated. Then, a separate overview of these research was presented based on the type of device used and an explanation of their structure. Finally, a model was designed and proposed to test comprehensive systems for monitoring the health of pregnant women. The proposed model is designed based on wearable and environmental sensors that collect daily medical data from pregnant women.

N2  - Rheumatologic diseases are marked by their complexity, involving immune-, metabolic- and mechanically mediated processes which can affect different organ systems. Despite a growing arsenal of targeted medications, many rheumatology patients fail to achieve full remission. Assessing disease activity remains challenging, as patients prioritize different symptoms and disease phenotypes vary. This is also reflected in clinical trials where the efficacy of drugs is not necessarily measured in an optimal way with the traditional outcome assessment. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has catalyzed a digital transformation in healthcare, embracing telemonitoring and patient-reported data via apps and wearables. As a further driver of digital medicine, electronic medical record (EMR) providers are actively engaged in developing algorithms for clinical decision support, heralding a shift towards patient-centered, decentralized care. Machine learning algorithms have emerged as valuable tools for handling the increasing volume of patient data, promising to enhance treatment quality and patient well-being. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are particularly promising for radiological image analysis, aiding in the detection of specific lesions such as erosions, sacroiliitis, or osteoarthritis, with several FDA-approved applications. Clinical predictions, including numerical disease activity forecasts and medication choices, offer the potential to optimize treatment strategies. Numeric predictions can be integrated into clinical workflows, allowing for shared decision making with patients. Clustering patients based on disease characteristics provides a personalized care approach. Digital biomarkers, such as patient-reported outcomes and wearables data, offer insights into disease progression and therapy response more flexibly and outside patient consultations. In association with patient-reported outcomes, disease-specific digital biomarkers via image recognition or single-camera motion capture enables more efficient remote patient monitoring. Digital biomarkers may also play a major role in clinical trials in the future as continuous, disease-specific outcome measurement facilitating decentralized studies. Prediction models can help with patient selection in clinical trials, such as by predicting high disease activity. Efforts are underway to integrate these advancements into clinical workflows using digital pathways and remote patient monitoring platforms. In summary, machine learning, digital biomarkers, and advanced imaging technologies hold immense promise for enhancing clinical decision support and clinical trials in rheumatology. Effective integration will require a multidisciplinary approach and continued validation through prospective studies.

N2  - Wheezing is a critical indicator of various respiratory conditions, including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Current diagnosis relies on subjective lung auscultation by physicians. Enabling this capability via a low-profile, objective wearable device for remote patient monitoring (RPM) could offer pre-emptive, accurate respiratory data to patients. With this goal as our aim, we used a low-profile accelerometer-based wearable system that utilizes deep learning to objectively detect wheezing along with respiration rate using a single sensor. The miniature patch consists of a sensitive wideband MEMS accelerometer and low-noise CMOS interface electronics on a small board, which was then placed on nine conventional lung auscultation sites on the patient’s chest walls to capture the pulmonary-induced vibrations (PIVs). A deep learning model was developed and compared with a deterministic time–frequency method to objectively detect wheezing in the PIV signals using data captured from 52 diverse patients with respiratory diseases. The wearable accelerometer patch, paired with the deep learning model, demonstrated high fidelity in capturing and detecting respiratory wheezes and patterns across diverse and pertinent settings. It achieved accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 95%, 96%, and 93%, respectively, with an AUC of 0.99 on the test set—outperforming the deterministic time–frequency approach. Furthermore, the accelerometer patch outperforms the digital stethoscopes in sound analysis while offering immunity to ambient sounds, which not only enhances data quality and performance for computational wheeze detection by a significant margin but also provides a robust sensor solution that can quantify respiration patterns simultaneously.

N2  - Background: Despite the existence of evidence-based rehabilitation strategies that address biomechanical deficits, the persistence of recurrent ankle problems in 70% of patients with acute ankle sprains highlights the unresolved nature of this issue. Artificial intelligence (AI) emerges as a promising tool to identify definitive predictors for ankle sprains. This paper aims to summarize the use of AI in investigating the ankle biomechanics of healthy and subjects with ankle sprains. Methods: Articles published between 2010 and 2023 were searched from five electronic databases. 59 papers were included for analysis with regards to: i). types of motion tested (functional vs. purposeful ankle movement); ii) types of biomechanical parameters measured (kinetic vs kinematic); iii) types of sensor systems used (lab-based vs field-based); and, iv) AI techniques used. Findings: Most studies (83.1%) examined biomechanics during functional motion. Single kinematic parameter, specifically ankle range of motion, could obtain accuracy up to 100% in identifying injury status. Wearable sensor exhibited high reliability for use in both laboratory and on-field/clinical settings. AI algorithms primarily utilized electromyography and joint angle information as input data. Support vector machine was the most used supervised learning algorithm (18.64%), while artificial neural network demonstrated the highest accuracy in eight studies. Interpretations: The potential for remote patient monitoring is evident with the adoption of field-based devices. Nevertheless, AI-based sensors are underutilized in detecting ankle motions at risk of sprain. We identify three key challenges: sensor designs, the controllability of AI models, and the integration of AI-sensor models, providing valuable insights for future research.

N2  - Introduction & Objectives: Associations between survival rates after undergoing radical cystectomy (RC) for bladder cancer and activity levels have not been reported. Wearable devices enable measurement of activity levels, and may offer additional prognostic information for prediction of survival in addition to traditionally used clinicopathological features. Materials & Methods: The iROC randomized trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03049410) compared recovery following intracorporeal robot-assisted RC (iRARC) vs open RC (ORC) for bladder cancer. Physical activity levels were collected by calculating the maximum number of steps per day and average steps per day over a 7-day period using a wrist-worn wearable device at baseline and 12 weeks postoperatively. Stamina was measured using the 30-second chair to stand assessment at baseline and 12 weeks post-operatively. Clinicopathological data such as age, gender, BMI, pathological T-stage and surgical margin status were collected during the peri-operative period. Cross-sectional imaging during follow-up was used to determine recurrence-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS) was collected up to 18 months. Results: Among 338 patients in the iROC trial, 319 patients received RC. OS and RFS following RC was 87% (n=278) and 82% (n=262) respectively over a median follow-up of 33 months. Wearable device data was available for 165 patients for analysis. There was no significant difference in maximum step-counts at baseline (mean 9388, SD 4552) when compared with 3-months post-operatively (mean 8792, SD 4055). Using clinicopathological features, we demonstrated an AUC of 74% to predict RFS which improved to 76% with the addition of activity and stamina data. For prediction of OS, using clinicopathological features demonstrated an AUC of 71% which improved to 81% with the addition of activity and stamina data. Kaplan Meier analysis with patients divided into low and high risk groups by the final model showed an increased RFS (99% vs 59%) and OS (98% vs 53%) in 33 months after surgery. Conclusions: Wearable device and stamina data may offer additional prognostic information which could supplement traditional clinicopathological features. With modern wearable devices, continuous activity data supplemented with heart rate data may further improve clinical models to predict RFS and OS. [Figure presented]

N2  - With the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, social isolation and quarantine have become commonplace across the world. IoT health monitoring solutions eliminate the need for regular doctor visits and interactions among patients and medical personnel. Many patients in wards or intensive care units require continuous monitoring of their health. Continuous patient monitoring is a hectic practice in hospitals with limited staff; in a pandemic situation like COVID-19, it becomes much more difficult practice when hospitals are working at full capacity and there is still a risk of medical workers being infected. In this study, we propose an Internet of Things (IoT)-based patient health monitoring system that collects real-time data on important health indicators such as pulse rate, blood oxygen saturation, and body temperature but can be expanded to include more parameters. Our system is comprised of a hardware component that collects and transmits data from sensors to a cloud-based storage system, where it can be accessed and analyzed by healthcare specialists. The ESP-32 microcontroller interfaces with the multiple sensors and wirelessly transmits the collected data to the cloud storage system. A pulse oximeter is utilized in our system to measure blood oxygen saturation and body temperature, as well as a heart rate monitor to measure pulse rate. A web-based interface is also implemented, allowing healthcare practitioners to access and visualize the collected data in real-time, making remote patient monitoring easier. Overall, our IoT-based patient health monitoring system represents a significant advancement in remote patient monitoring, allowing healthcare practitioners to access real-time data on important health metrics and detect potential health issues before they escalate.

N2  - Stretchable sensors have been widely investigated and developed for the purpose of human motion detection, touch sensors, and healthcare monitoring, typically converting mechanical/structural deformation into electrical signals. The viscoelastic strain of stretchable materials often results in nonlinear stress-strain characteristics over a broad range of strains, consequently making the stretchable sensors at the body joints less accurate in predicting and recognizing human gestures. Accurate recognition of human gestures can be further deteriorated by environmental changes such as temperature and humidity. Here, we demonstrated an environment-adaptable high stress-strain linearity (up to ε = 150%) and high-durability (>100,000 cycles) stretchable sensor conformally laminated onto the body joints for human gesture recognition. The serpentine configuration of our ionic liquid-based stretchable film enabled us to construct broad data sets of mechanical strain and temperature changes for machine learning-based gesture recognition. Signal recognition and training of distinct strains and environmental stimuli using a machine learning-based algorithm analysis successfully measured and predicted the joint motion in a temperature-changing environment with an accuracy of 92.86% (R-squared). Therefore, we believe that our serpentine-shaped ion gel-based stretchable sensor harmonized with machine-learning analysis will be a significant achievement toward environmentally adaptive and multianalyte sensing applications. Our proposed machine learning-enabled multisensor system may enable the development of future electronic devices such as wearable electronics, soft robotics, electronic skin, and human-machine interaction systems.

N2  - Respiratory allergic diseases affect over 500 million people globally and pose a substantial burden in terms of morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Restrictive factors such as geographical disparities, infectious pandemics, limitations in resources, and shortages of allergy specialists in underserved areas impede effective management. Telemedicine encompasses real-time visits, store-and-forward option triage, and computer-based technologies for establishing efficient doctor-patient communication. Recent advances in digital technology, including designated applications, informative materials, digital examination devices, wearables, digital inhalers, and integrated platforms, facilitate personalized and evidence-based care delivery. The integration of telemonitoring in respiratory allergy care has shown beneficial effects on disease control, adherence, and quality of life. While the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of telemedicine, certain concerns regarding technical requirements, platform quality, safety, reimbursement, and regulatory considerations remain unresolved. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in telemonitoring applications holds promise for data analysis, pattern recognition, and personalized treatment plans. Striking the balance between AI-enabled insights and human expertise is crucial for optimizing the benefits of telemonitoring. While telemonitoring exhibits potential for enhancing patient care and healthcare delivery, critical considerations have to be addressed in order to ensure the successful integration of telemonitoring into the healthcare landscape.

N2  - Stoke is a leading cause of long-term disability, including upper-limb hemiparesis. Frequent, unobtrusive assessment of naturalistic motor performance could enable clinicians to better assess rehabilitation effectiveness and monitor patients' recovery trajectories. We therefore propose and validate a two-phase data analytic pipeline to estimate upper-limb impairment based on the naturalistic performance of activities of daily living (ADLs). Eighteen stroke survivors were equipped with an inertial sensor on the stroke-affected wrist and performed up to four ADLs in a naturalistic manner. Continuous inertial time series were segmented into sliding windows, and a machine-learned model identified windows containing instances of point-to-point (P2P) movements. Using kinematic features extracted from the detected windows, a subsequent model was used to estimate upper-limb motor impairment, as measured by the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA). Both models were evaluated using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. The P2P movement detection model had an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.72. FMA estimates had a normalized root mean square error of 18.8% with R2=0.72. These promising results support the potential to develop seamless, ecologically valid measures of real-world motor performance.

N2  - Cardiometabolic diseases (CMDs) are the major types of non-communicable diseases, contributing to huge disease burdens in the Western Pacific region (WPR). The use of digital health (dHealth) technologies, such as wearable gadgets, mobile apps, and artificial intelligence (AI), facilitates interventions for CMDs prevention and treatment. Currently, most studies on dHealth and CMDs in WPR were conducted in a few high- and middle-income countries like Australia, China, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and New Zealand. Evidence indicated that dHealth services promoted early prevention by behavior interventions, and AI-based innovation brought automated diagnosis and clinical decision-support. dHealth brought facilitators for the doctor-patient interplay in the effectiveness, experience, and communication skills during healthcare services, with rapidly development during the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019. In the future, the improvement of dHealth services in WPR needs to gain more policy support, enhance technology innovation and privacy protection, and perform cost-effectiveness research.

N2  - Remote monitoring and artificial intelligence will become common and intertwined in anesthesiology by 2050. In the intraoperative period, technology will lead to the development of integrated monitoring systems that will integrate multiple data streams and allow anesthesiologists to track patients more effectively. This will free up anesthesiologists to focus on more complex tasks, such as managing risk and making value-based decisions. This will also enable the continued integration of remote monitoring and control towers having profound effects on coverage and practice models. In the PACU and ICU, the technology will lead to the development of early warning systems that can identify patients who are at risk of complications, enabling early interventions and more proactive care. The integration of augmented reality will allow for better integration of diverse types of data and better decision-making. Postoperatively, the proliferation of wearable devices that can monitor patient vital signs and track their progress will allow patients to be discharged from the hospital sooner and receive care at home. This will require increased use of telemedicine, which will allow patients to consult with doctors remotely. All of these advances will require changes to legal and regulatory frameworks that will enable new workflows that are different from those familiar to today's providers.

N2  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative group of technologies in the field of medicine. Specifically in cardiology, numerous applications have materialized, and these are developing exponentially. Al-based risk prediction models leverage machine learning algorithms and large datasets to probe multiple variables, aid in the identification of individuals at high risk for adverse events, facilitate early interventions, and enable personalized risk assessments. Unique algorithms analyze medical images, such as electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, and cardiac computed tomography scans to enable rapid detection of abnormalities and aid in the accurate identification of cardiac pathologies. AI has also shown promise in guiding treatment decisions during coronary catheterization. In addition, AI has revolutionized remote patient monitoring and disease management by means of wearable and implantable sensing technologies. In this review, we discussed the field of cardiovascular genetics and personalized medicine, where AI holds great promise. While the applications of AI in cardiology are promising, challenges such as data privacy, interpretability of the findings, and multiple matters regarding ethics need to be addressed. We presented a succinct overview of the applications of AI in cardiology, highlighting its potential to revolutionize risk prediction, diagnosis, treatment, and personalized patient care.

T1  - PUFchain 3.0: Hardware-Assisted Distributed Ledger for Robust Authentication in Healthcare Cyber-Physical Systems
LA  - English
N2  - This article presents a novel hardware-assisted distributed ledger-based solution for simultaneous device and data security in smart healthcare. This article presents a novel architecture that integrates PUF, blockchain, and Tangle for Security-by-Design (SbD) of healthcare cyber-physical systems (H-CPSs). Healthcare systems around the world have undergone massive technological transformation and have seen growing adoption with the advancement of Internet-of-Medical Things (IoMT). The technological transformation of healthcare systems to telemedicine, e-health, connected health, and remote health is being made possible with the sophisticated integration of IoMT with machine learning, big data, artificial intelligence (AI), and other technologies. As healthcare systems are becoming more accessible and advanced, security and privacy have become pivotal for the smooth integration and functioning of various systems in H-CPSs. In this work, we present a novel approach that integrates PUF with IOTA Tangle and blockchain and works by storing the PUF keys of a patient's Body Area Network (BAN) inside blockchain to access, store, and share globally. Each patient has a network of smart wearables and a gateway to obtain the physiological sensor data securely. To facilitate communication among various stakeholders in healthcare systems, IOTA Tangle's Masked Authentication Messaging (MAM) communication protocol has been used, which securely enables patients to communicate, share, and store data on Tangle. The MAM channel works in the restricted mode in the proposed architecture, which can be accessed using the patient's gateway PUF key. Furthermore, the successful verification of PUF enables patients to securely send and share physiological sensor data from various wearable and implantable medical devices embedded with PUF. Finally, healthcare system entities like physicians, hospital admin networks, and remote monitoring systems can securely establish communication with patients using MAM and retrieve the patient's BAN PUF keys from the blockchain securely. Our experimental analysis shows that the proposed approach successfully integrates three security primitives, PUF, blockchain, and Tangle, providing decentralized access control and security in H-CPS with minimal energy requirements, data storage, and response time.

N2  - MXenes are a class of two-dimensional (2D) materials that have gained significant attention in the field of electronic skins (E-skins). MXene-based composites offer several advantages for E-skins, including high electrical conductivity, mechanical flexibility, transparency, and chemical stability. Their mechanical flexibility allows for conformal integration onto various surfaces, enabling the creation of E-skins that can closely mimic human skin. In addition, their high surface area facilitates enhanced sensitivity and responsiveness to external stimuli, making them ideal for sensing applications. Notably, MXene-based composites can be integrated into E-skins to create sensors that can detect various stimuli, such as temperature, pressure, strain, and humidity. These sensors can be used for a wide range of applications, including health monitoring, robotics, and human-machine interfaces. However, challenges related to scalability, integration, and biocompatibility need to be addressed. One important challenge is achieving long-term stability under harsh conditions such as high humidity. MXenes are susceptible to oxidation, which can degrade their electrical and mechanical properties over time. Another crucial challenge is the scalability of MXene synthesis, as large-scale production methods need to be developed to meet the demand for commercial applications. Notably, the integration of MXenes with other components, such as energy storage devices or flexible electronics, requires further developments to ensure compatibility and optimize overall performance. By addressing issues related to material stability, mechanical flexibility, scalability, sensing performance, and power supply, MXene-based E-skins can develop the fields of healthcare monitoring/diagnostics, prosthetics, motion monitoring, wearable electronics, and human-robot interactions. The integration of MXenes with emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence or internet of things, can unlock new functionalities and applications for E-skins, ranging from healthcare monitoring to virtual reality interfaces. This review aims to examine the challenges, advantages, and limitations of MXenes and their composites in E-skins, while also exploring the future prospects and potential advancements in this field.

N2  - Many stroke survivors experience persistent upper extremity impairment that limits performance in activities of daily living. Upper limb recovery requires high repetitions of task-specific practice. Stroke survivors are often prescribed task practices at home to supplement rehabilitation therapy. A poor quality of task practices, such as the use of compensatory movement patterns, results in maladaptive neuroplasticity and suboptimal motor recovery. There currently lacks a tool for the remote monitoring of movement quality of stroke survivors' task practices at home. The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of classifying movement quality at home using a wearable IMU. Nineteen stroke survivors wore an IMU sensor on the paretic wrist and performed four functional upper limb tasks in the lab and later at home while videorecording themselves. The lab data served as reference data to classify home movement quality using dynamic time warping. Incorrect and correct movement quality was labeled by a therapist. The home task practice movement quality was classified with an accuracy of 92% and F1 score of 0.95 for all tasks combined. Movement types contributing to misclassification were further investigated. The results support the feasibility of a home movement quality monitoring system to assist with upper limb rehabilitation post stroke.

N2  - The proposed work aims to develop an automated machine learning based network model for heart disease prediction with better accuracy. In the pre-processed data, the most significant features are selected using the White Shark Optimization based Linear Discriminant Analysis (WSO-LDA) technique, reducing computational complexity. Finally, the selected features are fed to the Hybrid Artificial Neural Network (HANN) with a Multi-Objective Spotted Hyena optimization (MOSHO) based classification stage. This stage classifies heart disease with minimized processing time.

N2  - Physical rehabilitation and exercise training have emerged as promising solutions for improving health, restoring function, and preserving quality of life in populations that face disparate health challenges related to disability. Despite the immense potential for rehabilitation and exercise to help people with disabilities live longer, healthier, and more independent lives, people with disabilities can experience physical, psychosocial, environmental, and economic barriers that limit their ability to participate in rehabilitation, exercise, and other physical activities. Together, these barriers contribute to health inequities in people with disabilities, by disproportionately limiting their ability to participate in health-promoting physical activities, relative to people without disabilities. Therefore, there is great need for research and innovation focusing on the development of strategies to expand accessibility and promote participation in rehabilitation and exercise programs for people with disabilities. Here, we discuss how cutting-edge technologies related to telecommunications, wearables, virtual and augmented reality, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing are providing new opportunities to improve accessibility in rehabilitation and exercise for people with disabilities. In addition, we highlight new frontiers in digital health technology and emerging lines of scientific research that will shape the future of precision care strategies for people with disabilities.

N2  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is capable of controlling the healthcare monitoring system for remote-based patients. Epilepsy, a chronic brain syndrome characterized by recurrent, unpredictable attacks, affects individuals of all ages. IoT-based seizure monitoring can greatly enhance seizure patients' quality of life. IoT device acquires patient data and transmits it to a computer program so that doctors can examine it. Currently, doctors invest significant manual effort in inspecting Electroencephalograph (EEG) signals to identify seizure activity. However, EEG-based seizure detection algorithms face challenges in real-world scenarios due to non-stationary EEG data and variable seizure patterns among patients and recording sessions. Therefore, a sophisticated computer-based approach is necessary to analyze complex EEG records. In this work, the authors proposed a hybrid approach by combining traditional convolution neural (CN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) along with an attention mechanism for the automatic recognition of epileptic seizures through EEG signal analysis. This attention mechanism focuses on significant subsets of EEG data for class recognition, resulting in improved model performance. The proposed methods are evaluated using a publicly available UCI epileptic seizure recognition dataset, which consists of five classes: four normal conditions and one abnormal seizure condition. Experimental results demonstrate that the suggested approach achieves an overall accuracy of 97.05% for the five-class EEG recognition data, with an accuracy of 99.52% for binary classification distinguishing seizure cases from normal instances. Furthermore, the proposed intelligent seizure recognition model is compatible with an IoMT (Internet of Medical Things) cloud-based smart healthcare framework.

N2  - Introduction: Apomorphine, a potent dopamine agonist, is a therapeutic option for patients with Parkinson’s disease and motor fluctuations. However, the adoption of and adherence to this therapy have been limited by the need for complex delivery devices and specialized care as well as resource consumption, posing challenges for new physicians. Thailand is a unique example of a developing nation that has successfully implemented and continued the use of this therapy by employing cooperative technology that has dramatically enhanced apomorphine delivery services. Methods: Establishing apomorphine delivery services requires significant resources and step-by-step solutions. We began our services by implementing various strategies in three chronological stages: the initial stage (2013–2015), intermediate stage (2016–2019), and current stage (2020–present), each presenting unique challenges. Together, we also implemented a proposed set of five mottos to strengthen our apomorphine delivery service. Using additive technology, we developed a patient registry platform that combined electronic data acquisition, video and remote monitoring using wearable sensors, and in-house mobile applications to support our service. Results: At the initial stage, we assembled a team to enhance the efficacy and confirm the safety of apomorphine treatment in our hospital. At the intermediate stage, we expanded our apomorphine delivery services beyond just the patients at our hospital. We supported other hospitals in Thailand in setting up their own apomorphine services by educating both physicians and nurses regarding apomorphine therapy. With this educational undertaking, increased apomorphine-related knowledge among medical professionals, and a greater number of hospitals providing apomorphine services, an increasing number of patients were administered apomorphine in subsequent years. Currently, we are providing effective apomorphine delivery to improve patient outcomes and are seamlessly integrating technology into clinical practice. Incorporating integrative technologies in our apomorphine delivery program yielded positive results in data collection and support throughout patient care, in tracking patients’ statuses, in the long-term use of this treatment, and in increasing medication adherence rates. Conclusion: This perspective paper describes how technology can help provide supportive healthcare services in resource-constrained environments, such as in Thailand, offering a step-by-step approach to overcoming several limitations. The valuable insights from our 10-year journey in successfully integrating technology into apomorphine delivery services can benefit new physicians seeking to replicate our success.

N2  - The morbidity and death rates linked to diabetes mellitus are substantially increased by foot ulcers, a prevalent consequence of the disease. Proper wound management is essential for controlling foot ulcers. This includes monitoring the ulcers' healing progress through clinical reviews, changing dressings as needed, treating infections with the right medications, and ensuring that the ulcer is offloaded correctly. Taking pictures of the ulcer was a dependable way to track how diabetic foot ulcers were healing in the past. Images of foot ulcers have recently experienced a tremendous change due to the emergence of digital cameras in cell phones. Artificial intelligence (AI) and other recent developments in digital health technology present a great chance to improve the efficiency of diabetes care, which might reduce the growth in healthcare costs associated with diabetes. Patients with diabetes can alleviate the burden on clinics and patients' transportation demands by electronically sharing photos of their ulcers, which diabetes care providers can remotely monitor. Improved remote monitoring of diabetic foot ulcers using smartphone apps is now possible with the help of a new generation of AI-powered solutions. This clinical update review aims to gather information on this trending topic so that medical professionals can be current on all the latest advancements in the field.

N2  - Introduction: Asthma is a common chronic respiratory disease affecting 262 million people globally, causing half a million deaths each year. Poor asthma outcomes are frequently due to non-adherence to medication, poor engagement with asthma services, and a lack of objective diagnostic tests. In recent years, technologies have been developed to improve diagnosis, monitoring, and care. Areas Covered: Technology has impacted asthma care with the potential to improve patient outcomes, reduce healthcare costs, and provide personalized management. We focus on current evidence on home diagnostics and monitoring, remote asthma reviews, and digital smart inhalers. PubMed, Ovid/Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus and Google Scholar were searched in November 2023 with no limit by year of publication. Expert Opinion: Advanced diagnostic technologies have enabled early asthma detection and personalized treatment plans. Mobile applications and digital therapeutics empower patients to manage their condition and improve adherence to treatments. Telemedicine platforms and remote monitoring devices have the potential to streamline asthma care. AI algorithms can analyze patient data and predict exacerbations in proof-of-concept studies. Technology can potentially provide precision medicine to a wider patient group in the future, but further development is essential for implementation into routine care which in itself will be a major challenge.

N2  - Postural instability is associated with disease status and fall risk in Persons with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS). However, assessments of postural instability, known as postural sway, leverage force platforms or wearable accelerometers, and are most often conducted in laboratory environments and are thus not broadly accessible. Remote measures of postural sway captured during daily life may provide a more accessible alterative, but their ability to capture disease status and fall risk has not yet been established. We explored the utility of remote measures of postural sway in a sample of 33 PwMS. Remote measures of sway differed significantly from lab-based measures, but still demonstrated moderately strong associations with patient-reported measures of balance and mobility impairment. Machine learning models for predicting fall risk trained on lab data provided an Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.79, while remote data only achieved an AUC of 0.51. Remote model performance improved to an AUC of 0.74 after a new, subject-specific k-means clustering approach was applied for identifying the remote data most appropriate for modelling. This cluster-based approach for analyzing remote data also strengthened associations with patient-reported measures, increasing their strength above those observed in the lab. This work introduces a new framework for analyzing data from remote patient monitoring technologies and demonstrates the promise of remote postural sway assessment for assessing fall risk and characterizing balance impairment in PwMS.

N2  - Wearable electroencephalography devices emerge as a cost-effective and ergonomic alternative to gold-standard polysomnography, paving the way for better health monitoring and sleep disorder screening. Machine learning allows to automate sleep stage classification, but trust and reliability issues have hampered its adoption in clinical applications. Estimating uncertainty is a crucial factor in enhancing reliability by identifying regions of heightened and diminished confidence. In this study, we used an uncertainty-centred machine learning pipeline, U-PASS, to automate sleep staging in a challenging real-world dataset of single-channel electroencephalography and accelerometry collected with a wearable device from an elderly population. We were able to effectively limit the uncertainty of our machine learning model and to reliably inform clinical experts of which predictions were uncertain to improve the machine learning model's reliability. This increased the five-stage sleep-scoring accuracy of a state-of-the-art machine learning model from 63.9% to 71.2% on our dataset. Remarkably, the machine learning approach outperformed the human expert in interpreting these wearable data. Manual review by sleep specialists, without specific training for sleep staging on wearable electroencephalography, proved ineffective. The clinical utility of this automated remote monitoring system was also demonstrated, establishing a strong correlation between the predicted sleep parameters and the reference polysomnography parameters, and reproducing known correlations with the apnea–hypopnea index. In essence, this work presents a promising avenue to revolutionize remote patient care through the power of machine learning by the use of an automated data-processing pipeline enhanced with uncertainty estimation.

N2  - Objective: Sleep monitoring has extensively utilized electroencephalogram (EEG) data collected from the scalp, yielding very large data repositories and well-trained analysis models. Yet, this wealth of data is lacking for emerging, less intrusive modalities, such as ear-EEG.Methods and procedures: The current study seeks to harness the abundance of open-source scalp EEG datasets by applying models pre-trained on data, either directly or with minimal fine-tuning; this is achieved in the context of effective sleep analysis from ear-EEG data that was recorded using a single in-ear electrode, referenced to the ipsilateral mastoid, and developed in-house as described in our previous work. Unlike previous studies, our research uniquely focuses on an older cohort (17 subjects aged 65-83, mean age 71.8 years, some with health conditions), and employs LightGBM for transfer learning, diverging from previous deep learning approaches. Results: Results show that the initial accuracy of the pre-trained model on ear-EEG was 70.1%, but fine-tuning the model with ear-EEG data improved its classification accuracy to 73.7%. The fine-tuned model exhibited a statistically significant improvement (p < 0.05, dependent t-test) for 10 out of the 13 participants, as reflected by an enhanced average Cohen's kappa score (a statistical measure of inter-rater agreement for categorical items) of 0.639, indicating a stronger agreement between automated and expert classifications of sleep stages. Comparative SHAP value analysis revealed a shift in feature importance for the N3 sleep stage, underscoring the effectiveness of the fine-tuning process.Conclusion: Our findings underscore the potential of fine-tuning pre-trained scalp EEG models on ear-EEG data to enhance classification accuracy, particularly within an older population and using feature-based methods for transfer learning. This approach presents a promising avenue for ear-EEG analysis in sleep studies, offering new insights into the applicability of transfer learning across different populations and computational techniques.Clinical impact: An enhanced ear-EEG method could be pivotal in remote monitoring settings, allowing for continuous, non-invasive sleep quality assessment in elderly patients with conditions like dementia or sleep apnea.

N2  - Background: Heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback is often performed with structured education, laboratory-based assessments, and practice sessions. It has been shown to improve psychological and physiological function across populations. However, a means to remotely use and monitor this approach would allow for wider use of this technique. Advancements in wearable and digital technology present an opportunity for the widespread application of this approach. Objective: The primary aim of the study was to determine the feasibility of fully remote, self-administered short sessions of HRV-directed biofeedback in a diverse population of health care workers (HCWs). The secondary aim was to determine whether a fully remote, HRV-directed biofeedback intervention significantly alters longitudinal HRV over the intervention period, as monitored by wearable devices. The tertiary aim was to estimate the impact of this intervention on metrics of psychological well-being. Methods: To determine whether remotely implemented short sessions of HRV biofeedback can improve autonomic metrics and psychological well-being, we enrolled HCWs across 7 hospitals in New York City in the United States. They downloaded our study app, watched brief educational videos about HRV biofeedback, and used a well-studied HRV biofeedback program remotely through their smartphone. HRV biofeedback sessions were used for 5 minutes per day for 5 weeks. HCWs were then followed for 12 weeks after the intervention period. Psychological measures were obtained over the study period, and they wore an Apple Watch for at least 7 weeks to monitor the circadian features of HRV. Results: In total, 127 HCWs were enrolled in the study. Overall, only 21 (16.5%) were at least 50% compliant with the HRV biofeedback intervention, representing a small portion of the total sample. This demonstrates that this study design does not feasibly result in adequate rates of compliance with the intervention. Numerical improvement in psychological metrics was observed over the 17-week study period, although it did not reach statistical significance (all P>.05). Using a mixed effect cosinor model, the mean midline-estimating statistic of rhythm (MESOR) of the circadian pattern of the SD of the interbeat interval of normal sinus beats (SDNN), an HRV metric, was observed to increase over the first 4 weeks of the biofeedback intervention in HCWs who were at least 50% compliant. Conclusions: In conclusion, we found that using brief remote HRV biofeedback sessions and monitoring its physiological effect using wearable devices, in the manner that the study was conducted, was not feasible. This is considering the low compliance rates with the study intervention. We found that remote short sessions of HRV biofeedback demonstrate potential promise in improving autonomic nervous function and warrant further study. Wearable devices can monitor the physiological effects of psychological interventions.

N2  - In recent times, there has been a notable rise in the utilization of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) frameworks particularly those based on edge computing, to enhance remote monitoring in healthcare applications. Most existing models in this field have been developed temperature screening methods using RCNN, face temperature encoder (FTE), and a combination of data from wearable sensors for predicting respiratory rate (RR) and monitoring blood pressure. These methods aim to facilitate remote screening and monitoring of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and COVID-19. However, these models require inadequate computing resources and are not suitable for lightweight environments. We propose a multimodal screening framework that leverages deep learning-inspired data fusion models to enhance screening results. A Variation Encoder (VEN) design proposes to measure skin temperature using Regions of Interest (RoI) identified by YoLo. Subsequently, the multi-data fusion model integrates electronic records features with data from wearable human sensors. To optimize computational efficiency, a data reduction mechanism is added to eliminate unnecessary features. Furthermore, we employ a contingent probability method to estimate distinct feature weights for each cluster, deepening our understanding of variations in thermal and sensory data to assess the prediction of abnormal COVID-19 instances. Simulation results using our lab dataset demonstrate a precision of 95.2&#x0025;, surpassing state-of-the-art models due to the thoughtful design of the multimodal data-based feature fusion model, weight prediction factor, and feature selection model.

N2  - Shoulder rehabilitation is a process that requires physical therapy sessions to recover the mobility of the affected limbs. However, these sessions are often limited by the availability and cost of specialized technicians, as well as the patient's travel to the session locations. This paper presents a novel smartphone-based approach using a pose estimation algorithm to evaluate the quality of the movements and provide feedback, allowing patients to perform autonomous recovery sessions. This paper reviews the state of the art in wearable devices and camera-based systems for human body detection and rehabilitation support and describes the system developed, which uses MediaPipe to extract the coordinates of 33 key points on the patient's body and compares them with reference videos made by professional physiotherapists using cosine similarity and dynamic time warping. This paper also presents a clinical study that uses QTM, an optoelectronic system for motion capture, to validate the methods used by the smartphone application. The results show that there are statistically significant differences between the three methods for different exercises, highlighting the importance of selecting an appropriate method for specific exercises. This paper discusses the implications and limitations of the findings and suggests directions for future research.

N2  - Objective.Physiological sensor data (e.g. photoplethysmograph) is important for remotely monitoring patients' vital signals, but is often affected by measurement noise. Existing feature-based models for signal cleaning can be limited as they might not capture the full signal characteristics.Approach.In this work we present a deep learning framework for sensor signal cleaning based on dilated convolutions which capture the coarse- and fine-grained structure in order to classify whether a signal is noisy or clean. However, since obtaining annotated physiological data is costly and time-consuming we propose an autoencoder-based semi-supervised model which is able to learn a representation of the sensor signal characteristics, also adding an element of interpretability.Main results.Our proposed models are over 8% more accurate than existing feature-based approaches with half the false positive/negative rates. Finally, we show that with careful tuning (that can be improved further), the semi-supervised model outperforms supervised approaches suggesting that incorporating the large amounts of available unlabeled data can be advantageous for achieving high accuracy (over 90%) and minimizing the false positive/negative rates.Significance.Our approach enables us to reliably separate clean from noisy physiological sensor signal that can pave the development of reliable features and eventually support decisions regarding drug efficacy in clinical trials.

N2  - The remarkable increase in the number of patients poses challenges to healthcare providers in telemedicine systems, and certain challenges are associated with the difficulties of identifying the most urgent emergencies to save lives. Remote monitoring of patients with multiple chronic diseases (MCDs) is a major issue that must be addressed. This work aims to improve the triage system for remote patients who are far from hospital and use telemedicine system by considering the variation in their chronic diseases (chronic heart, hypertension, hypotension, and diabetes diseases). The proposed framework named machine learning-based remote triage framework in telemedicine (ML-ART) collects the patient’s data using medical sensors and sources within Internet of medical things (IoMT) environment, transfers the data through gateway to telemedicine servers in the hospital, where machine learning is performed to classify (triages) each patient into one of five categories (normal, cold, sick, urgent, and risk) depending on the medical emergency level of the patients. The simulation results showed that the decision tree (DT) algorithm has the most accurate result, 100%, compared to the relevant algorithm (neural network (NN) 97%, support vector machine (SVM) 91%, and random forest (RF) 97%). The performance of (DT) logically matched the medical triage procedure. Moreover, the (ML-ART) outcomes improve the performance of e-triage system for remote patients and pave the way for future works in telemedicine systems through moving from remote monitoring to remote diagnostics.

N2  - Core body temperature (CBT) is a key vital sign and fever is an important indicator of disease. In the past decade, there has been growing interest for vital sign monitoring technology that may be embedded in wearable devices, and the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for remote patient monitoring systems. While wrist-worn sensors allow continuous assessment of heart rate and oxygen saturation, reliable measurement of CBT at the wrist remains challenging. In this study, CBT was measured continuously in a free-living setting using a novel technology worn at the wrist and compared to reference core body temperature measurements, i.e., CBT values acquired with an ingestible temperature-sensing pill. Fifty individuals who received the COVID-19 booster vaccination were included. The datasets of 33 individuals were used to develop the CBT prediction algorithm, and the algorithm was then validated on the datasets of 17 participants. Mean observation time was 26.4 h and CBT > 38.0 °C occurred in 66% of the participants. CBT predicted by the wrist-worn sensor showed good correlation to the reference CBT (r = 0.72). Bland–Altman statistics showed an average bias of 0.11 °C of CBT predicted by the wrist-worn device compared to reference CBT, and limits of agreement were − 0.67 to + 0.93 °C, which is comparable to the bias and limits of agreement of commonly used tympanic membrane thermometers. The small size of the components needed for this technology would allow its integration into a variety of wearable monitoring systems assessing other vital signs and at the same time allowing maximal freedom of movement to the user.

N2  - Serious clinical complications (SCC; CTCAE grade ≥ 3) occur frequently in patients treated for hematological malignancies. Early diagnosis and treatment of SCC are essential to improve outcomes. Here we report a deep learning model-derived SCC-Score to detect and predict SCC from time-series data recorded continuously by a medical wearable. In this single-arm, single-center, observational cohort study, vital signs and physical activity were recorded with a wearable for 31,234 h in 79 patients (54 Inpatient Cohort (IC)/25 Outpatient Cohort (OC)). Hours with normal physical functioning without evidence of SCC (regular hours) were presented to a deep neural network that was trained by a self-supervised contrastive learning objective to extract features from the time series that are typical in regular periods. The model was used to calculate a SCC-Score that measures the dissimilarity to regular features. Detection and prediction performance of the SCC-Score was compared to clinical documentation of SCC (AUROC ± SD). In total 124 clinically documented SCC occurred in the IC, 16 in the OC. Detection of SCC was achieved in the IC with a sensitivity of 79.7% and specificity of 87.9%, with AUROC of 0.91 ± 0.01 (OC sensitivity 77.4%, specificity 81.8%, AUROC 0.87 ± 0.02). Prediction of infectious SCC was possible up to 2 days before clinical diagnosis (AUROC 0.90 at −24 h and 0.88 at −48 h). We provide proof of principle for the detection and prediction of SCC in patients treated for hematological malignancies using wearable data and a deep learning model. As a consequence, remote patient monitoring may enable pre-emptive complication management.

N2  - Developing drugs for rare diseases is challenging, and the precision and objectivity of outcome measures is critical to this process. In recent years, a number of technologies have increasingly been used for remote monitoring of patient health. We report a systematic literature review that aims to summarize the current state of progress with regard to the use of digital outcome measures for real-life motor function assessment of patients with rare neurological diseases. Our search of published literature identified 3826 records, of which 139 were included across 27 different diseases. This review shows that use of digital outcome measures for motor function outside a clinical setting is feasible and employed in a broad range of diseases, although we found few outcome measures that have been robustly validated and adopted as endpoints in clinical trials. Future research should focus on validation of devices, variables, and algorithms to allow for regulatory qualification and widespread adoption.

N2  - Post-surgical treatments of the human throat often require continuous monitoring of diverse vital and muscle activities. However, wireless, continuous monitoring and analysis of these activities directly from the throat skin have not been developed. Here, we report the design and validation of a fully integrated standalone stretchable device platform that provides wireless measurements and machine learning-based analysis of diverse vibrations and muscle electrical activities from the throat. We demonstrate that the modified composite hydrogel with low contact impedance and reduced adhesion provides high-quality long-term monitoring of local muscle electrical signals. We show that the integrated triaxial broad-band accelerometer also measures large body movements and subtle physiological activities/vibrations. We find that the combined data processed by a 2D-like sequential feature extractor with fully connected neurons facilitates the classification of various motion/speech features at a high accuracy of over 90%, which adapts to the data with noise from motion artifacts or the data from new human subjects. The resulting standalone stretchable device with wireless monitoring and machine learning-based processing capabilities paves the way to design and apply wearable skin-interfaced systems for the remote monitoring and treatment evaluation of various diseases.

N2  - Background: Physical disabilities become more common with advancing age. Rehabilitation restores function, maintaining independence for longer. However, the poor availability and accessibility of rehabilitation limits its clinical impact. Artificial Intelligence (AI) guided interventions have improved many domains of healthcare, but whether rehabilitation can benefit from AI remains unclear. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of AI-supported physical rehabilitation technology tested in the clinical setting to understand: 1) availability of AI-supported physical rehabilitation technology; 2) its clinical effect; 3) and the barriers and facilitators to implementation. We searched in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Science Citation Index (Web of Science), CIRRIE (now NARIC), and OpenGrey. Results: We identified 9054 articles and included 28 projects. AI solutions spanned five categories: App-based systems, robotic devices that replace function, robotic devices that restore function, gaming systems and wearables. We identified five randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which evaluated outcomes relating to physical function, activity, pain, and health-related quality of life. The clinical effects were inconsistent. Implementation barriers included technology literacy, reliability, and user fatigue. Enablers included greater access to rehabilitation programmes, remote monitoring of progress, reduction in manpower requirements and lower cost. Conclusion: Application of AI in physical rehabilitation is a growing field, but clinical effects have yet to be studied rigorously. Developers must strive to conduct robust clinical evaluations in the real-world setting and appraise post implementation experiences.

N2  - The administration of Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy for relapsed refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) predominantly takes place in the inpatient setting to monitor for adverse effects like cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity leading to increased healthcare utilization, infection risk and patient discomfort. Shifting the administration model to the outpatient setting may improve patient experience, optimize hospital bed utilization and decrease costs, but requires an objective and reliable method for CRS detection to monitor patients remotely and safely. The feasibility of using a wearable device for detecting CRS following CAR-T therapy in RRMM was compared to standard of care (SoC) nursing-recorded vital signs in this investigator initiated clinical trial (IIT). Patients wore a wearable device that collected continuous measures of temperature, pulse, respiratory rate, and O2 saturation in addition to SoC while receiving CAR-T therapy from the day infusion to discharge. Changes in vital signs captured by the device were analyzed based on 2 thresholds: (i) CRS timestamps were tagged in wearable data when pt's temperature breached a fixed threshold of 38 0C ( Tf) defined as fever by the American Society of Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT), and (ii) when pt's temperature breached an individualized threshold of 2 standard deviations above their baseline temperature ( Ti) [see Figure 1]. Outcomes were time to first detection of CRS in wearable data vs. SoC. Wearable adherence was the duration pts wore the device over the total monitoring period. To date, 34 pts were screened, 28 enrolled (82.3% uptake), 1 was excluded from the dataset because of concurrent COVID-19, and 2 pts with CRS were excluded from time to detection comparison because of wearable adherence <50% during high-risk windows (defined as the time period where CRS is expected per known data for the CAR-T product). Max CRS grades were 1 (17 pts), 2 (1 pt), 3 (2 pts), and 4 (1 pt); 5 pts did not have clinical CRS. Patients wore the device for a median of 13 (12-15) days out of a median of 15.5 (14-17) days of inpatient admission for CAR-T infusion. Median individualized temperature threshold was 37.4 (37-37.6) C. Wearable adherence was 64 (51 - 77) % and 72 (57 - 87) % for the overall monitoring and high-risk periods, respectively. The wearable detected the initial CRS events at a median of 22 (-43 - 113.5) min earlier than SoC with Tf and a median of 184 (53 - 312) mins earlier than SoC with Ti method. In the no CRS subgroup, false CRS detection occurred in 1 pt with the Tf and 2 pts with the Ti method. Preliminary results suggest that time to CRS detection by the wearable device preceded SoC detection by a median of 103 minutes corroborated by both threshold methods. Temperature thresholds calibrated to the baseline temperature of individual patients facilitate earlier detection of CRS than fixed thresholds per clinical/ASTCT criteria. While the low false detection rate in is encouraging, these may also potentially be attributed to subclinical events. Both pts who had “false positive” triggers breached their individualized temperature thresholds via device readings while only recording low-grade temperatures that did not meet clinical CRS criteria per ASTCT, indicating possible capture of subclinical events. The study showcases the utility of continuous remote patient vital signs monitoring by wearable devices in efficiently capturing CRS, including subclinical events, earlier than SoC. Objective and reliable CRS monitoring may help safely transition workflows to outpatient CAR-T administration models. Analysis of trends in cytokine biomarkers for early CRS detection signal(s) is currently underway. Cytokine signals, alone and in combination with device data, are planned to be incorporated into machine learning models to build a CRS prediction index in future analyses. Figure 1: Snapshot in time of the continuous temperature data generated by the wearable device after CAR-T infusion showing capture of cytokine release syndrome. – Ti (solid line) represents the median baseline temperature of the patient over the entire duration of the data capture by the wearable device – Tf (dotted line) represents the temperature threshold of 38 0C, the clinical definition of fever as per ASTCT – Black diamond: clinical CRS event, when temperature >38 0C as recorded by nursing

N2  - Microalgal biotechnology holds the potential for renewable biofuels, bioproducts, and carbon capture applications due to unparalleled photosynthetic efficiency and diversity. Outdoor open raceway pond (ORP) cultivation enables utilization of sunlight and atmospheric carbon dioxide to drive microalgal biomass synthesis for production of bioproducts including biofuels; however, environmental conditions are highly dynamic and fluctuate both diurnally and seasonally, making ORP productivity prediction challenging without time-intensive physical measurements and location-specific calibrations. Here, for the first time, we present an image-based deep learning method for the prediction of ORP productivity. Our method is based on parameter profile plot images of sensor parameters, including pH, dissolved oxygen, temperature, photosynthetically active radiation, and total dissolved solids. These parameters can be remotely monitored without physical interaction with ORPs. We apply the model to data we generated during the Unified Field Studies of the Algae Testbed Public-Private-Partnership (ATP3 UFS), the largest publicly available ORP data set to date, which includes millions of sensor records and 598 productivities from 32 ORPs operated in 5 states in the United States. We demonstrate that this approach significantly outperforms an average value based traditional machine learning method (R2 = 0.77 ≫ R2 = 0.39) without considering bioprocess parameters (e.g., biomass density, hydraulic retention time, and nutrient concentrations). We then evaluate the sensitivity of image and monitoring data resolutions and input parameter variations. Our results demonstrate ORP productivity can be effectively predicted from remote monitoring data, providing an inexpensive tool for microalgal production and operational forecasting.

N2  - Healthcare highly depends on accessing, processing, analyzing, sharing, and storing electronic data. Cloud computing has evolved in various healthcare fields, such as bioinformatics, health management systems, and telemedicine. The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), a subset of IoT, is an essential element of a healthcare management system. The expeditious development in IoMT, intelligent medical devices, healthcare applications, and high-speed networks has enabled medical systems to efficiently diagnose, treat, manage diseases, and remotely monitor and improve the Quality of Service (QoS). To achieve this high data, high speed network, longer battery life and reliable connectivity are basic requirements. 5G conformed these needs with its numerous and distinct potential. However, the shortcomings of these medical devices in the IoMT are privacy concerns and direct physical threats. We propose a new algorithm to enhance the QoS of the IoMT devices/systems. Initially, the dataset is collected and the 5G network is operationalized. We propose a Dynamic Step-wise Tiny Encryption Algorithm with Fruit Fly Optimization Algorithm to encrypt data. Encrypted data is transmitted using the Energy Efficient Routing Protocol. When the user requests to access the data, the data is decrypted. We show that the proposed system has higher QoS attributes and is more effective. Our experimental results show that our proposed solution considerably improves QoS and network performance in terms of lifetime, communication overhead, storage footprint, and power consumption compared to the competing methods.

N2  - “Digital Hypertension” is a new research field proposed by the Japanese Society of Hypertension that integrates digital technology into hypertension management and proactively promotes research activities. This novel approach includes the development of new technologies for better BP management, such as sensors for detecting environmental factors that affect BP, information processing, and machine learning. To facilitate “Digital Hypertension,” a more sophisticated BP monitoring system capable of measuring an individual’s BP more frequently in various situations would be required. With the use of these technologies, hypertension management could shift from the current “dots” management based on office BP readings during clinic visits to a “line” management system based on seamless home BP or individual BP data taken by a wearable BP monitoring device.

N2  - Introduction: Digital health technologies including smart sensors, Big Data and Artificial Intelligence are the future of cancer care. LifeChamps (https://lifechamps.eu/) combines a multimodal, real-world data collection and processing platform to enhance older survivors‘ cancer care and clinical teams in the remote monitoring of their patients. Objectives: To determine feasibility parameters of the use of the LifeChamps platform by older cancer survivors and clinical teams in real-life settings. Methods: The platform prototype is being tested in Greece, Spain, Sweden and the UK, involving survivors aged 65+ with breast/prostate cancer, or melanoma. A 3-month prospective study is ongoing with patients using wearables and sensors (smart watch, smart weight scale, home sensors), as well as a mobile app to answer Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) on a monthly basis. Results: To date, 78 participants (37 male) (mean age 72; SD 5.8) have been enrolled, 28.2% of them are frail, based on Tilburg Frailty Indicator. To this point, the recruitment rate is 39%, the dropout rate is 5.1%, with a mean enrolment duration of 46.7 days. Participants access the mobile app on average 8.85 (median 6.33) sessions/month for 20.8 minutes/session. Adherence to data collection via PROMs is currently 70%. Conclusion: LifeChamps provides a digital platform to facilitate QoL remote monitoring. Despite a somewhat low recruitment rate, study participants do adopt the technology and remain in the study. Our findings from the analysis of patient generated data via machine learning algorithms will inform future work on how digital health technologies can provide clinical teams with key information to lead to enhanced outcomes for older cancer survivors.

N2  - PURPOSE: The advent of new medical devices allows patients with asthma to self-monitor at home, providing a more complete picture of their disease than occasional in-person clinic visits. This raises a pertinent question: which devices and parameters perform best in exacerbation detection? METHODS: A total of 149 patients with asthma (90 children, 59 adults) participated in a 6-month observational study. Participants (or parents) regularly (daily for the first 2 weeks and weekly for the next 5.5 months, with increased frequency during exacerbations) performed self-examinations using 3 devices: an artificial intelligence (AI)-aided home stethoscope (providing wheezes, rhonchi, and coarse and fine crackles intensity; respiratory and heart rate; and inspiration-to-expiration ratio), a peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) meter, and a peak expiratory flow (PEF) meter and filled out a health state survey. The resulting 6,029 examinations were evaluated by physicians for the presence of exacerbations. For each registered parameter, a machine learning model was trained, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated to assess its utility in exacerbation detection. RESULTS: The best single-parameter discriminators of exacerbations were wheezes intensity for young children (AUC 84% [95% CI, 82%-85%]), rhonchi intensity for older children (AUC 81% [95% CI, 79%-84%]), and survey answers for adults (AUC 92% [95% CI, 89%-95%]). The greatest efficacy (in terms of AUC) was observed for a combination of several parameters. CONCLUSIONS: The AI-aided home stethoscope provides reliable information on asthma exacerbations. The parameters provided are effective for children, especially those younger than 5 years of age. The introduction of this tool to the health care system might enhance asthma exacerbation detection substantially and make remote monitoring of patients easier.

N2  - The prevalence of hypertension increasing along with the population aging, although the management level of hypertension has been improved obviously, the control rate is still very low. Telemonitoring and artificial intelligence offers new strategies for hypertension management. Based on remote transmission and big data technology, a web-based standardized blood pressure (BP) analysis and reporting system covers automatic office BP, ambulatory and home BP measurements, provides accurate BP readings, offers standardized interpretation, fully reflects the characteristics of individual' BP, and eventually contributes to the prediction and early warning of cardiovascular diseases. With the support of big data and artificial intelligence machine learning technology, it can not only improve the detection efficiency of secondary hypertension but also make it possible to describe the main pathophysiological causes of most traditional primary hypertension, and effective treatment for the etiological factors will helps to improve the hypertension control status. KEY WORDS hypertension, telemonitoring, big data, etiological classification.

N2  - Introduction: Distinguishing Parkinson's disease (PD) from Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) at early disease stages is important for clinical trial enrollment and clinical care/prognostication. Methods: We recruited 21 participants with PSP(n = 11) or PD(n = 10) with reliable caregivers. Standardized passage reading, counting, and sustained phonation were recorded on the BioDigit Home tablet (BioSensics LLC, Newton, MA USA), and speech features from the assessments were analyzed using the BioDigit Speech platform (BioSensics LLC, Newton, MA USA). An independent t-test was performed to compare each speech feature between PSP and PD participants. We also performed Spearman's correlations to evaluate associations between speech measures and clinical scores (e.g., PSP rating scales and MoCA). In addition, the model's performance in classifying PSP and PD was evaluated using Rainbow passage reading analysis. Results: During Rainbow passage reading, PSP participants had a significantly slower articulation rate (2.45(0.49) vs 3.60(0.47) words/minute), lower speech-to-pause ratio (2.33(1.08) vs 3.67(1.18)), intelligibility dynamic time warping (DTW, 0.26(0.19) vs 0.53(0.26)), and similarity DTW (0.43(0.27) vs 0.67(0.13)) compared to PD participants. PSP participants also had longer pause times (17.24(5.47) vs 8.45(3.13) sec) and longer total signal times (52.44(6.67) vs (36.67(6.73) sec) when reading the passage. In terms of the phonation ‘a’, PSP participants showed a significant higher spectral entropy, spectral centroid, and spectral spread compared to PD participants and no differences were found for phonation ‘e’. PD participants had more accurate reverse number counts than PSP participants (14.89(3.86) vs 7.36(4.67)). PSP Rating Scale (PSPRS) dysarthria (r = 0.79, p = 0.004) and bulbar item scores (r = 0.803, p = 0.005) were positively correlated with articulation rate in reverse number counts. Correct reverse number counts were positively correlated with total Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores (r = 0.703, p = 0.016). Machine learning models using passage reading-derived measures obtained an AUC of 0.93, and the sensitivity/specificity in correctly classifying PSP and PD participants were 0.95 and 0.90, respectively. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates the feasibility of differentiating PSP from PD using a digital health technology platform. Further multi-center studies are needed to expand and validate our initial findings.

N2  - Background: Fatal Coronary Heart Disease (FCHD) is a proxy for sudden cardiac death (SCD), affecting >17 million people/year globally, with high prevalence even in younger adults. Electrocardiographic Artificial Intelligence (ECG-AI) models assessing cardiovascular disease risk have been developed but few exist for FCHD. ECG-AI based FCHD risk prediction tools, which are currently lacking, based on single lead ECG data from wearable devices would enable scalable screening and/or monitoring of younger populations. Objectives: To develop a single lead ECG-based deep learning model for FCHD risk prediction and assess prediction concordance between paired clinical and Apple Watch ECGs. Methods: A FCHD lead I ECG-based 1D convolutional neural network model was developed using 420,834 ECGs (68,094 patients), obtained from UTHSC, TN. The final model was tested on paired lead I clinical and Apple Watch ECGs collected at the same visit from 55 volunteers (unknown FCHD status). The concordance of FCHD risk between the two ECG modalities was assessed using paired correlation analysis. Results: The UTHSC lead I ECG-AI model was developed on 80% data (5-fold cross-validation) and resulted in AUC=0.74 on the 20% holdout data. When implemented on 55 paired ECGs, there was strong positive correlation (Fig. 1) between predictions obtained from the two ECG modalities (correlation coefficient=0.82, p<0.001). Conclusion: FCHD risk may be predicted from 1 lead ECGs using Apple Watches with moderate accuracy and be concordant with clinical ECGs. ECG-AI models implemented on Apple Watch ECGs can help screen large populations for FCHD with ease and at low cost. Adding clinical variables in deep survival models might improve accuracy (further work). Some limitations of this pilot work include: lead I ECG-AI FCHD model is preliminary and not optimized, and the resolution (signal depth) of Apple Watch ECGs needs to be adjusted to match clinical ECGs (A/D conversion), yet such documentation is lacking.

N2  - Introduction: Continuous and non-invasive monitoring of health through digital devices is promising in multiple sclerosis (MS) to early detect relevant changes (e.g., relapses) and consequently anticipate tailored interventions. Objectives/Aims: Aim of this pilot study within the H2020 project ALAMEDA-Bridging the Early Diagnosis and Treatment Gaps of Brain Diseases was to develop an integrated platform collecting patient-centred data from wearables and mobile devices through digital patient-reported outcomes (ePRO) and to test the toolkit's feasibility and usability in people with MS (PwMS). Methods: Data collection has been defined according to MULTIACT shared decisions model involving all relevant stakeholders in the selection of outcomes. These included physical parameters continuously recorded by a smartwatch; ePRO on mobility, cognitive functions, emotional status, daily life and sleep quality periodically administered to users through a smartphone App. Pseudonymised data were stored on the cloud and made accessible to healthcare professionals and researchers using a dashboard. The percentage of completed over scheduled ePRO was calculated as a feasibility outcome. Usability of the toolkit was measured with the System Usability Scale (SUS). Results: 20 PwMS (14 females; age=37.8±6.0 years; all relapsingremitting MS; disease duration=9.1±6.8 years; EDSS=2.2±1.3) were included and asked to use the ALAMEDA toolkit for one year. Half of them reached the 6-month milestone. Users correctly completed 53% of the scheduled ePRO and regularly wore the smartwatch without discomfort. Values of generated data are in line with those reported by the literature (Daily steps=8415±3028; daily minutes of vigorous / moderate / light activity=9.8±9.4 / 14.5±11.7 / 268.7±68.9; daily sedentary minutes=705.1±117.6; Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale-12=37.2±15.7; Arm function in Multiple Sclerosis Questionnaire=47.4±20.4; Perceived Deficit Questionnaire= 25.2±16.4; Beck Anxiety Inventory=17.3±16.0; Modified Fatigue Impact Scale=18.5±14.5; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index=25.2±16.4). SUS revealed high levels of confidence using the system and very high intention to use it in the future. Conclusion: The ALAMEDA toolkit seems feasible and usable to remotely monitor multiple domains of health status in PwMS. Further analysis on the dataset, including Artificial Intelligence and machine learning algorithms, may allow predicting relevant changes throughout the course of MS and anticipating the therapeutic intervention.

N2  - BACKGROUND: e-Health has played a crucial role during the COVID-19 pandemic in primary health care. e-Health is the cost-effective and secure use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) to support health and health-related fields. Various stakeholders worldwide use ICTs, including individuals, non-profit organizations, health practitioners, and governments. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, ICT has improved the quality of healthcare, the exchange of information, training of healthcare professionals and patients, and facilitated the relationship between patients and healthcare providers. This study systematically reviews the literature on ICT-based automatic and remote monitoring methods, as well as different ICT techniques used in the care of COVID-19-infected patients. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this systematic literature review is to identify the e-Health methods, associated ICTs, method implementation strategies, information collection techniques, advantages, and disadvantages of remote and automatic patient monitoring and care in COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The search included primary studies that were published between January 2020 and June 2022 in scientific and electronic databases, such as EBSCOhost, Scopus, ACM, Nature, SpringerLink, IEEE Xplore, MEDLINE, Google Scholar, JMIR, Web of Science, Science Direct, and PubMed. In this review, the findings from the included publications are presented and elaborated according to the identified research questions. Evidence-based systematic reviews and meta-analyses were conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework. Additionally, we improved the review process using the Rayyan tool and the Scale for the Assessment of Narrative Review Articles (SANRA). Among the eligibility criteria were methodological rigor, conceptual clarity, and useful implementation of ICTs in e-Health for remote and automatic monitoring of COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Our initial search identified 664 potential studies; 102 were assessed for eligibility in the pre-final stage and 65 articles were used in the final review with the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The review identified the following eHealth methods-Telemedicine, Mobile Health (mHealth), and Telehealth. The associated ICTs are Wearable Body Sensors, Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms, Internet-of-Things, or Internet-of-Medical-Things (IoT or IoMT), Biometric Monitoring Technologies (BioMeTs), and Bluetooth-enabled (BLE) home health monitoring devices. Spatial or positional data, personal and individual health, and wellness data, including vital signs, symptoms, biomedical images and signals, and lifestyle data are examples of information that is managed by ICTs. Different AI and IoT methods have opened new possibilities for automatic and remote patient monitoring with associated advantages and weaknesses. Our findings were represented in a structured manner using a semantic knowledge graph (e.g., ontology model). CONCLUSIONS: Various e-Health methods, related remote monitoring technologies, different approaches, information categories, the adoption of ICT tools for an automatic remote patient monitoring (RPM), advantages and limitations of RMTs in the COVID-19 case are discussed in this review. The use of e-Health during the COVID-19 pandemic illustrates the constraints and possibilities of using ICTs. ICTs are not merely an external tool to achieve definite remote and automatic health monitoring goals; instead, they are embedded in contexts. Therefore, the importance of the mutual design process between ICT and society during the global health crisis has been observed from a social informatics perspective. A global health crisis can be observed as an information crisis (e.g., insufficient information, unreliable information, and inaccessible information); however, this review shows the influence of ICTs on COVID-19 patients' health monitoring and related information collection techniques.

N2  - Smart home monitoring systems via internet of things (IoT) are required for taking care of elders at home. They provide the flexibility of monitoring elders remotely for their families and caregivers. Activities of daily living are an efficient way to effectively monitor elderly people at home and patients at caregiving facilities. The monitoring of such actions depends largely on IoT-based devices, either wireless or installed at different places. This paper proposes an effective and robust layered architecture using multisensory devices to recognize the activities of daily living from anywhere. Multimodality refers to the sensory devices of multiple types working together to achieve the objective of remote monitoring. Therefore, the proposed multimodal-based approach includes IoT devices, such as wearable inertial sensors and videos recorded during daily routines, fused together. The data from these multi-sensors have to be processed through a pre-processing layer through different stages, such as data filtration, segmentation, landmark detection, and 2D stick model. In next layer called the features processing, we have extracted, fused, and optimized different features from multimodal sensors. The final layer, called classification, has been utilized to recognize the activities of daily living via a deep learning technique known as convolutional neural network. It is observed from the proposed IoT-based multimodal layered system's results that an acceptable mean accuracy rate of 84.14% has been achieved.

N2  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the loss of neuronal cells, which leads to synaptic dysfunction and cognitive defects. Despite the advancements in treatment strategies, the management of PD is still a challenging event. Early prediction and diagnosis of PD are of utmost importance for effective management of PD. In addition, the classification of patients with PD as compared to normal healthy individuals also imposes drawbacks in the early diagnosis of PD. To address these challenges, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models have been implicated in the diagnosis, prediction, and treatment of PD. Recent times have also demonstrated the implication of AI and ML models in the classification of PD based on neuroimaging methods, speech recording, gait abnormalities, and others. Herein, we have briefly discussed the role of AI and ML in the diagnosis, treatment, and identification of novel biomarkers in the progression of PD. We have also highlighted the role of AI and ML in PD management through altered lipidomics and gut-brain axis. We briefly explain the role of early PD detection through AI and ML algorithms based on speech recordings, handwriting patterns, gait abnormalities, and neuroimaging techniques. Further, the review discuss the potential role of the metaverse, the Internet of Things, and electronic health records in the effective management of PD to improve the quality of life. Lastly, we also focused on the implementation of AI and ML-algorithms in neurosurgical process and drug discovery.

N2  - Progressive pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a complex interstitial lung disease that impacts substantially on patients’ daily lives, requiring personalised and integrated care. We summarise the main needs of patients with PF and their caregivers, and suggest a supportive care approach. Individualised care, education, emotional and psychological support, specialised treatments, and better access to information and resources are necessary. Management should start at diagnosis, be tailored to the patient’s needs, and consider end-of-life care. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions should be individualised, including oxygen therapy and pulmonary rehabilitation, with digital healthcare utilised as appropriate. Further research is needed to address technical issues related to oxygen delivery and digital healthcare.

N2  - Background: Innovative models of health care that involve advanced technology in the form of a digital hospital are emerging globally. Models include technology such as machine learning and smart wearables, that can be used to integrate patient data and improve continuity of care. This model may have benefits in situations where patient deterioration must be detected quickly so that a rapid response can occur such as cardiopulmonary settings. Aim: The purpose of this scoping review was to examine the evidence for a digital hospital model of care, in the context of cardiac and pulmonary settings. Design: Scoping review. Data sources: Databases searched were using PsycInfo, Ovid MEDLINE, and CINAHL. Studies written in English and containing key terms related to digital hospital and cardiopulmonary care were included. The Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for systematic reviews was used to assess the risk of bias. Results: Thirteen (13) studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. For cardiac conditions, a deep-learning-based rapid response system warning system for predicting patient deterioration leading to cardiac arrest had up to 257% higher sensitivity than conventional methods. There was also a reduction in the number of patients who needed to be examined by a physician. Using continuous telemonitoring with a wireless real-time electrocardiogram compared with non-monitoring, there was improved initial resuscitation and 24-hour post-event survival for high-risk patients. However, there were no benefits for survival to discharge. For pulmonary conditions, a natural language processing algorithm reduced the time to asthma diagnosis, demonstrating high predictive values. Virtual inhaler education was found to be as effective as in-person education, and prescription error was reduced following the implementation of computer-based physician order entry electronic medical records and a clinical decision support tool. Conclusions: While we currently have only a brief glimpse at the impact of technology care delivery for cardiac and respiratory conditions, technology presents an opportunity to improve quality and safety in care, but only with the support of adequate infrastructure and processes.

N2  - Wearable devices and mobile sensors enable the real-time collection of an abundant source of physiological and behavioural data unobtrusively. Unlike traditional in-person evaluation or ecological momentary assessment (EMA) questionnaire-based approaches, these data sources open many possibilities in remote patient monitoring. However, defining robust models is challenging due to the data's noisy and frequently missing observations. This work proposes an attention-based Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network-based pipeline for predicting mobility impairment based on WHODAS 2.0 evaluation from such digital biomarkers. Furthermore, we addressed the missing observation problem by utilising hidden Markov models and the possibility of including information from unlabelled samples via transfer learning. We validated our approach using two wearable/mobile sensor data sets collected in the wild and socio-demographic information about the patients. Our results showed that in the WHODAS 2.0 mobility impairment prediction task, the proposed pipeline outperformed a prior baseline while additionally providing interpretability with attention heatmaps. Moreover, using a much smaller cohort via task transfer learning, the same model could learn to predict generalised anxiety severity accurately based on GAD-7 scores.

N2  - Traditional trial designs have well-recognized inefficiencies and logistical barriers to participation. Decentralized trials and digital health solutions have been suggested as potential solutions and have certainly risen to the challenge during the pandemic. Clinical trial designs are now increasingly data driven. The use of distributed clinical data networks and digitization has helped to fundamentally upgrade existing research systems. A trial design may vary anywhere from fully decentralized to hybrid to traditional on-site. Various decentralization components are available for stakeholders to increase the reach and pace of their trials, such as electronic informed consent, remote interviews, administration, outcome assessment, monitoring, and laboratory and imaging modalities. Furthermore, digital health technologies can be included to enrich study conduct. However, careful consideration is warranted, including assessing verification and validity through usability studies and having various contingencies in place through dedicated risk assessment. Selecting the right combination depends not just on the ability to handle patient care and the medical know-how but also on the availability of appropriate technologic infrastructure, skills, and human resources. Throughout this process, quality of evidence generation and physician-patient relation must not be undermined. Here we also address some knowledge gaps, cost considerations, and potential impact of decentralization and digitization on inclusivity, recruitment, engagement, and retention. Last, we mention some future directions that may help drive the necessary change in the right direction.

N2  - Background and aims: Nocturnal hypoglycaemia is a common problem in insulin-treated individuals with type 2 diabetes and may lead to hypoglycaemia unawareness, anxiety, and poor adherence to treatment. To address this issue, we aimed to develop a predictive model to identify individuals at risk of nocturnal hypoglycaemia before going to bed at night. Materials and methods: The development of the prediction model was considered a classification problem and followed FDA's Good Machine Learning Practice for Medical Device Development. We collected continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data from 60 individuals with type 2 diabetes from the intervention arm in the ongoing telemonitoring trial DiaMonT. Data were segmented into 24-hour periods separated at midnight and labelled as nocturnal hypoglycaemia when at least fifteen consecutive minutes were spent below 3.9 mmol/L during the following night (00:01-05:59). The periods were further divided into four intervals for feature selection: last night (00:01-05:59), morning (06:00-09:00), day (06:00-00:00), and evening (21:00-00:00). Potential CGM-based features included the minimum and maximum values, range, slope, glycemic variability, standard deviation, variance, and mean from each time interval as well as the last value for the period. Additionally, a relative variant of each feature was calculated by subtracting the mean of the feature from previous periods within the same individual. The data were partitioned into 67% for training a model based on logistic regression while the remaining 33% were reserved for testing the model. During training, the data were balanced using synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) and features were included in the model by forward selection in a five-fold cross-validation. The model was then tested on the remaining 33% for the ability to predict 24-hour periods resulting in nocturnal hypoglycaemia. Results: From the CGM data, 5100 periods were extracted out of which 92 periods resulted in nocturnal hypoglycaemia. The final model was based on the minimum value during the day, the minimum value during last night, the last value (relative), and the variance during evening (relative). The model obtained an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.85 on the independent test data (Figure 1) (p < 0.001). The model had a sensitivity of 0.75 at a specificity of 0.80. Conclusion: A prediction model based on CGM data can potentially be a valuable addition to telemonitoring to prevent nocturnal hypoglycaemia for insulin-treated individuals with type 2 diabetes.

N2  - This article reviews the recent advances in the field of batteryless near-field communication (NFC) sensors for chemical sensing and biosensing. The commercial availability of low-cost commercial NFC integrated circuits (ICs) and their massive integration in smartphones, used as readers and cloud interfaces, have aroused great interest in new batteryless NFC sensors. The fact that coil antennas are not importantly affected by the body compared with other wireless sensors based on far-field communications makes this technology suitable for future wearable point-of-care testing (PoCT) devices. This review first compares energy harvesting based on NFC to other energy-harvesting technologies. Next, some practical recommendations for designing and tuning NFC-based tags are described. Power transfer is key because in most cases, the energy harvested has to be stable for several seconds and not contaminated by undesired signals. For this reason, the effect of the dimensions of the coils and the conductivity on the wireless power transfer is thoroughly discussed. In the last part of the review, the state of the art in NFC-based chemical and biosensors is presented. NFC-based tags (or sensor tags) are mainly based on commercial or custom NFC ICs, which are used to harvest the energy from the RF field generated by the smartphone to power the electronics. Low-consumption colorimeters and potentiostats can be integrated into these NFC tags, opening the door to the integration of chemical sensors and biosensors, which can be harvested and read from a smartphone. The smartphone is also used to upload the acquired information to the cloud to facilitate the internet of medical things (IoMT) paradigm. Finally, several chipless sensors recently proposed in the literature as a low-cost alternative for chemical applications are discussed.

N2  - Aims: Over the past 25 years there has been a substantial development in the field of digital electrophysiology (EP) and in parallel a substantial increase in publications on digital cardiology. In this celebratory paper, we provide an overview of the digital field by highlighting publications from the field focusing on the EP Europace journal. Results: In this journey across the past quarter of a century we follow the development of digital tools commonly used in the clinic spanning from the initiation of digital clinics through the early days of telemonitoring, to wearables, mobile applications, and the use of fully virtual clinics. We then provide a chronicle of the field of artificial intelligence, a regulatory perspective, and at the end of our journey provide a future outlook for digital EP. Conclusion: Over the past 25 years Europace has published a substantial number of papers on digital EP, with a marked expansion in digital publications in recent years.

N2  - Purpose of reviewWe highlight the recent advances in home monitoring of patients with asthma, and show that these advances converge towards the implementation of digital twin systems.Recent findingsConnected devices for asthma are increasingly numerous, reliable and effective: new electronic monitoring devices extend to nebulizers and spacers, are able to assess the quality of the inhalation technique, and to identify asthma attack triggers when they include a geolocation function; environmental data can be acquired from databases and refined by wearable air quality sensors; smartwatches are better validated. Connected devices are increasingly integrated into global monitoring systems. At the same time, machine learning techniques open up the possibility of using the large amount of data collected to obtain a holistic assessment of asthma patients, and social robots and virtual assistants can help patients in the daily management of their asthma.SummaryAdvances in the internet of things, machine learning techniques and digital patient support tools for asthma are paving the way for a new era of research on digital twins in asthma.

N2  - Purpose of reviewOnline technologies play an increasing role in facilitating care for patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD). In this review, we will give an overview of different applications of the internet of medical things (IoMT) for patients with ILD.Recent findingsVarious applications of the IoMT, including teleconsultations, virtual MDTs, digital information, and online peer support, are now used in daily care of patients with ILD. Several studies showed that other IoMT applications, such as online home monitoring and telerehabilitation, seem feasible and reliable, but widespread implementation in clinical practice is lacking. The use of artificial intelligence algorithms and online data clouds in ILD is still in its infancy, but has the potential to improve remote, outpatient clinic, and in-hospital care processes. Further studies in large real-world cohorts to confirm and clinically validate results from previous studies are needed.SummaryWe believe that in the near future innovative technologies, facilitated by the IoMT, will further enhance individually targeted treatment for patients with ILD by interlinking and combining data from various sources.

N2  - Continuous monitoring of stress in individuals during their daily activities has become an inevitable need in present times. Unattended stress is a silent killer and may lead to fatal physical and mental disorders if left unidentified. Stress identification based on individual judgement often leads to under-diagnosis and delayed treatment possibilities. EEG-based stress monitoring is quite popular in this context, but impractical to use for continuous remote monitoring.Continuous remote monitoring of stress using signals acquired from everyday wearables like smart watches is the best alternative here. Non-EEG data such as heart rate and ectodermal activity can also act as indicators of physiological stress. In this work, we have explored the possibility of using nonlinear features from non-EEG data such as (a) heart rate, (b) ectodermal activity, (c) body temperature (d) SpO2 and (e) acceleration in detecting four different types of neurological states; namely (1) Relaxed state, (2) State of Physical stress, (3) State of Cognitive stress and (4) State of Emotional stress. Physiological data of 20 healthy adults have been used from the noneeg database of PhysioNet.Results: We used two machine learning models; a linear logistic regression and a nonlinear random forest to detect (a) stress from relaxed state and (4) the four different neurological states. We trained the models using linear and nonlinear features separately. For the 2-class and 4-class problems, using nonlinear features increased the accuracy of the models. Moreover, it is also proved in this study that by using nonlinear features, we can avoid the use of complex machine learning models.

N2  - Coronary artery disease (CAD), an acute and life-threatening cardiovascular disease, is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Coronary angiography, the principal diagnostic tool for CAD, is invasive, expensive, and requires a lot of skilled effort. The current study aims to develop an automated and non-invasive CAD detection model and improve its performance as closely as possible to clinically acceptable diagnostic sensitivity. Electrocardiogram (ECG) characteristics are observed to be altered due to CAD and can be studied to develop a screening tool for its detection. The subject's clinical information can help broadly identify the high-cardiac-risk population and serve as a primary step in diagnosing CAD. This paper presents an approach to automatically detect CAD based on clinical data, morphological ECG features, and heart rate variability (HRV) features extracted from short-duration Lead-II ECG recordings. A few popular machine-learning classifiers, including support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), K-nearest neighbours (KNN), Gaussian Naïve Bayes (GNB), and multi-layer perceptron (MLP), are trained on the extracted feature space, and their performance is evaluated. Classifiers built by integrating clinical data and features extracted from ECG recordings demonstrated better performance than those built on each feature set separately, and the RF classifier outperforms other considered machine learners and reports an average testing accuracy of 94% and a G-mean score of 92% with a 5-fold cross-validation training accuracy of 95(± 0.04)%.Clinical relevance- The proposed method uses a brief, single-lead ECG recording and performs similarly to current clinical practices in an explainable manner. This makes it suitable for deployment via wearable technology (like smart watch gadgets) and telemonitoring, which may facilitate an earlier and more widespread CAD diagnosis.

N2  - Ischemic heart disease (IHD), a critical and dreadful cardiovascular disease, is a leading cause of death globally. The steady progress of IHD leads to an irreversible condition called myocardial infarction (MI). The detection of MI can be done by observing the altered electrocardiogram (ECG) characteristics. Often, automated ECG analysis is preferred in place of visual inspection to reduce time and ensure reliable detection even when the recording quality is not very good. This paper presents an automated approach to classify recent MI, past MI, and normal sinus rhythm (NSR) classes based on the morphological features of the ECG. In clinical practice, a standard 12-lead ECG setup is typically employed to identify MI. However, acquiring a 12-lead ECG is not always convenient. Hence, in this study, we have explored the possibility of using a minimal number of ECG leads by deriving the augmented limb leads using leads I and II. A well-known and widely used ensemble machine learning tool, the random forest (RF) classifier is trained using features extracted from the derived augmented limb leads and their combinations. An RF classifier built using features extracted from all limb leads has outperformed classifiers built on combinations of them with five-fold cross-validation training accuracy of 97.9 (±0.008) % and testing accuracy of 98 %.Clinical relevance- As high sensitivity is reported in identifying recent MI and past MI classes, the proposed approach is suitable for preventative healthcare applications since it is less likely that subjects with recent or past MI will be misclassified. Due to its low computational complexity, better interpretability, and comparable performance to the state-of-the-art results, the proposed approach can be employed in clinical and cardiac health screening applications. It also has the potential to be employed in remote monitoring with mobile and wearable devices because it is built on features extracted from only lead I and II ECG recordings.

N2  - The real-time revolutions per minute (RPM) data, ECG signal, pulse rate, and oxygen saturation levels were collected during 16-minute cycling exercises. In parallel, ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) were collected each minute from the study participants. A 2-minute moving window, with one minute shift, was applied to each 16-minute exercise session to divide it into a total of fifteen 2-minute windows. Based on the self-reported RPE, each exercise window was labeled as "high exertion" or "low exertion" classes. The heart rate variability (HRV) characteristics in time and frequency domains were extracted from the collected ECG signals for each window. In addition, collected oxygen saturation levels, pulse rate, and RPMs were averaged for each window. The best predictive features were then selected using the minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) algorithm. Top selected features were then used to assess the accuracy of five ML classifiers to predict the level of exertion. The Naïve Bayes model demonstrated the best performance with an accuracy of 80% and an F1 score of 79%.

N2  - Introduction: Pain patients are increasingly asked to engage daily with smartphone applications and wearable devices for remote monitoring. However, some chronic pain patients are inconsistent with their patterns of wearable device use, charging, and responding to digital surveys. This clinical study examines whether patients will engage more regularly with these digital tools when provided with personalized feedback and targeted messaging regarding pain and common comorbidities via an entertaining user experience. Methods: This is a prospective, longitudinal, dual-arm clinical trial designed to enroll 28 patients into two study arms (14 patients per arm). In the traditional study arm, patients are provided with a remote monitoring smartphone application and wearable physiologic sensors. In the personalized experience study arm, patients are provided with these same tools, but are given a version of the remote monitoring app that provides a simple personalized user experience including engaging dialog, stories, targeted education related to chronic pain, and feedback on their health and holistic well-being. Patient engagement is measured by the consistency with which patients engage with the application, respond to therapy-related surveys, and use their wearable device properly. The interim analysis included in this report consists of the available survey data from five initial subjects in the traditional study arm before and during the SCS trial period. Enrollment of the first patient in the personalized experience arm occurred in July 2022 and follow-up and analysis are ongoing. Results: Three of five interviewed subjects wanted to be able to view their wearable data daily, while the other two subjects preferred to view them weekly. Subjects preferred using the Oura™ Ring and Apple Watch® due to their comfort and ease of use. Subjects also preferred the weekly recharging of the Oura ring (vs. daily watch charging). Conclusions: This research seeks to demonstrate feasibility for using patient-centric app design and artificial intelligence to improve user engagement with digital therapies in the field of chronic pain. We hypothesize that patients will be more engaged with use of digital tools if they are provided with an engaging and simple user experience that interests them and educates them regarding their chronic pain and related well-being topics. Chronic pain is a multi-dimensional disorder that can impact patient physical, social, and mental well-being [1]. Ongoing research should investigate whether digital education can also be used concurrently with neuromodulation to motivate patients to make positive lifestyle changes that are synergistic with their SCS therapy.

N2  - Background: Clinical trials for novel therapeutics are expensive, time-consuming, and have an end-to-end success rate of under 8%. Several applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) to trial design and conduct have the potential to increase trial efficiency, and the use of real world data (RWD) is often critical to the development of these novel applications. Objectives: The objective of this study was to comprehensively review applications of AI/ML that used RWD to improve clinical trial design and conduct. Methods: We conducted a review of published work on AI/ML-based technologies for clinical trials, focusing on AI/ML applications trained using RWD. The review provides a survey of the field, with concrete examples of applications and explanations of the machine learning task. Additionally, we describe open challenges and opportunities for the use of AI/ML based on real world data to improve clinical trials. Results: RWD is essential to training AI/ML algorithms used for clinical trial optimization; over 50 published examples were found by the review. We identified four overarching categories of applications: (1) improved participant recruitment; (2) enhanced trial management; (3) enabled remote patient monitoring (e.g., signal processing from wearables); and (4) in silico trials. Lack of freely available RWD, limited model generalizability, privacy considerations, potential fairness issues, lack of familiarity with AI/ML methods, and limited prospective evaluations of novel approaches pose challenges for the expanded use of AI/ML in clinical trial optimization. Opportunities for advancing applications include transfer learning to accommodate limited domain-specific data, increased use of multi-modal data to train models, and applications of federated learning to develop AI/ML models when data is distributed. Conclusions: AI/ML technologies based on RWE have the potential to reduce costs and optimize clinical trials, and hold promise to continue to improve study efficiency in a way that directly impacts the patient experience.

N2  - Objectives: COVID 19 and increasing unmet needs of health technology had accelerated an adoption of digital health globally and the major categories are mobile-health, health information technology, telemedicine. Digital health interventions have various benefit on clinical efficacy, quality of care and reducing healthcare costs. The objective of the study is to identify new reimbursement policy trend of digital health medical devices in South Korea. Methods: Official announcements published in national bodies and supplementary secondary research were used to capture policies, frameworks and currently approved products since 2019. Results: With policy development, several digital health devices and AI software have been introduced as non-reimbursement by utilizing new Health Technology Assessment (nHTA) pathway including grace period of nHTA and innovative medical devices integrated assessment pathway. AI based cardiac arrest risk management software (DeepCARS®) and electroceutical device for major depressive disorders (MINDD STIM®) have been approved as non-reimbursement use for about 3 years. Two digital therapeutics for insomnia and AI software for diagnosis of cerebral infarction were approved as the first innovative medical devices under new integrated assessment system, and they could be treated in the market. In addition, there is remote patient monitoring (RPM) reimbursement service fee. Continuous glucose monitoring devices have been reimbursed for type 1 diabetes patients by the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) since January 2019. Homecare RPM service for peritoneal dialysis patients with cloud platform (Sharesource®) has been reimbursed since December 2019, and long-term continuous ECG monitoring service fee for wearable ECG monitoring devices (ATpatch®, MEMO®) became reimbursement since January 2022. Conclusions: Although Korean government has been developed guidelines for digital health actively, only few products had been reimbursed. To introduce new technologies for improved patient centric treatment, novel value-based assessment and new pricing guideline of digital health medical devices are quite required.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Central nervous system (CNS) disorders benefit from ongoing monitoring to assess disease progression and treatment efficacy. Mobile health (mHealth) technologies offer a means for the remote and continuous symptom monitoring of patients. Machine Learning (ML) techniques can process and engineer mHealth data into a precise and multidimensional biomarker of disease activity. OBJECTIVE: This narrative literature review aims to provide an overview of the current landscape of biomarker development using mHealth technologies and ML. Additionally, it proposes recommendations to ensure the accuracy, reliability, and interpretability of these biomarkers. METHODS: This review extracted relevant publications from databases such as PubMed, IEEE, and CTTI. The ML methods employed across the selected publications were then extracted, aggregated, and reviewed. RESULTS: This review synthesized and presented the diverse approaches of 66 publications that address creating mHealth-based biomarkers using ML. The reviewed publications provide a foundation for effective biomarker development and offer recommendations for creating representative, reproducible, and interpretable biomarkers for future clinical trials. CONCLUSION: mHealth-based and ML-derived biomarkers have great potential for the remote monitoring of CNS disorders. However, further research and standardization of study designs are needed to advance this field. With continued innovation, mHealth-based biomarkers hold promise for improving the monitoring of CNS disorders.

N2  - Hospital readmission prediction models often perform poorly, but most only use information collected until the time of hospital discharge. In this clinical trial, we randomly assigned 500 patients discharged from hospital to home to use either a smartphone or wearable device to collect and transmit remote patient monitoring (RPM) data on activity patterns after hospital discharge. Analyses were conducted at the patient-day level using discrete-time survival analysis. Each arm was split into training and testing folds. The training set used fivefold cross-validation and then final model results are from predictions on the test set. A standard model comprised data collected up to the time of discharge including demographics, comorbidities, hospital length of stay, and vitals prior to discharge. An enhanced model consisted of the standard model plus RPM data. Traditional parametric regression models (logit and lasso) were compared to nonparametric machine learning approaches (random forest, gradient boosting, and ensemble). The main outcome was hospital readmission or death within 30 days of discharge. Prediction of 30-day hospital readmission significantly improved when including remotely-monitored patient data on activity patterns after hospital discharge and using nonparametric machine learning approaches. Wearables slightly outperformed smartphones but both had good prediction of 30-day hospital-readmission.

N2  - Aggression in children is highly prevalent and can have devastating consequences, yet there is currently no objective method to track its frequency in daily life. This study aims to investigate the use of wearable-sensor-derived physical activity data and machine learning to objectively identify physical-aggressive incidents in children. Participants (n = 39) aged 7 to 16 years, with and without ADHD, wore a waist-worn activity monitor (ActiGraph, GT3X+) for up to one week, three times over 12 months, while demographic, anthropometric, and clinical data were collected. Machine learning techniques, specifically random forest, were used to analyze patterns that identify physical-aggressive incident with 1-min time resolution. A total of 119 aggression episodes, lasting 7.3 ± 13.1 min for a total of 872 1-min epochs including 132 physical aggression epochs, were collected. The model achieved high precision (80.2%), accuracy (82.0%), recall (85.0%), F1 score (82.4%), and area under the curve (89.3%) to distinguish physical aggression epochs. The sensor-derived feature of vector magnitude (faster triaxial acceleration) was the second contributing feature in the model, and significantly distinguished aggression and non-aggression epochs. If validated in larger samples, this model could provide a practical and efficient solution for remotely detecting and managing aggressive incidents in children.

N2  - In this work, we propose SemBox - Semantic interoperability in a Box, to enable wireless on-the-go communication between heterogeneous wearable health monitoring devices. It can connect wirelessly to the health monitoring devices and receive their data packets. It uses a Mamdani-based fuzzy inference system with data pre-processing to classify the received data packet into one of the classes of the vital parameters. It enables semantic interoperability by labelling and annotating the data packets based on the extracted packet information. We implement SemBox using three different health monitoring wearables, with different keywords used for each vital parameter representation in the data packet. SemBox shows a maximum classification accuracy of 85.71%, with a maximum PDR of 1 at the SemBox with varying device parameters. Overall, SemBox is a potential plug-and-play solution to achieve semantic interoperability and collaboration between heterogeneous health monitoring wearable devices, irrespective of their commercial and proprietary specifications. It is customizable for applications that use multiple heterogeneous devices for collaborative monitoring and decision support. SemBox enables interoperability among health monitoring devices, introduces flexibility and ease the inter-device dynamics in the domain of biomedical research.

N2  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is recently seeing significant advances in teledermatology (TD), also thanks to the developments that have taken place during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the last two years, there was an important development of studies that focused on opportunities, perspectives, and problems in this field. The topic is very important because the telemedicine and AI applied to dermatology have the opportunity to improve both the quality of healthcare for citizens and the workflow of healthcare professionals. This study conducted an overview on the opportunities, the perspectives, and the problems related to the integration of TD with AI. The methodology of this review, following a standardized checklist, was based on: (I) a search of PubMed and Scopus and (II) an eligibility assessment, using parameters with five levels of score. The outcome highlighted that applications of this integration have been identified in various skin pathologies and in quality control, both in eHealth and mHealth. Many of these applications are based on Apps used by citizens in mHealth for self-care with new opportunities but also open questions. A generalized enthusiasm has been registered regarding the opportunities and general perspectives on improving the quality of care, optimizing the healthcare processes, minimizing costs, reducing the stress in the healthcare facilities, and in making citizens, now at the center, more satisfied. However, critical issues have emerged related to: (a) the need to improve the process of diffusion of the Apps in the hands of citizens, with better design, validation, standardization, and cybersecurity; (b) the need for better attention paid to medico-legal and ethical issues; and (c) the need for the stabilization of international and national regulations. Targeted agreement initiatives, such as position statements, guidelines, and/or consensus initiatives, are needed to ensure a better result for all, along with the design of both specific plans and shared workflows.

N2  - Introduction: Drug therapy for obesity is rapidly gaining popularity, largely due to the advent of GLP-1 RA based medications. Millions of people are potentially eligible to receive and benefit from this mode of therapy. Monitoring of medical therapy is essential to guide patients and ensure adherence and optimal results. The high prevalence of obesity combined with limited numbers of physicians adequately trained in its management poses a challenge to provision of care at scale. An online platform with an AI-powered clinical dashboard allows for granular, temporal patient reporting on outcomes and side effects. Method: The “clinics” application by StuffThatWorks is a unique tool that allows chronological flow and automated data processing for remote patient monitoring. Patients accept a digital invitation and complete online surveys about medical history, eating and lifestyle habits. The system integrates objective data from digital scales, wearables, and EMR, as well as subjective data, with patients tracking their overall well-being, symptoms, and side effects. These data are transformed into a concise graphical format expediting clinical assessment and facilitating timely messaging, including encouragement and responses to any form of decline. Artificial intelligence provides automated clinical insights to providers to guide decision support and deliver patient feedback. Lastly, the system facilitates contextual education, with automated delivery of educational patient materials correlating to treatment stage Results: The “clinics” application to support pharmacotherapy for weight loss has been adopted by large weight management clinics in Israel. Patients self-weigh at least once weekly using a Bluetooth connected scale and are prompted to report on their general wellbeing and gastrointestinal side effects. Other pertinent symptoms, target behaviors, life events and data from wearables are also tracked. Data are processed and presented online in summary format on the dashboard with clinical alerts, and in full on individual patient pages. The application allows rapid, effective evaluation of health status and remote personalized management. Clinics choose different methods to utilize the platform according to their resources. Case managers may review the entire dashboard daily and triage care accordingly, or rely on preset thresholds for clinical alerts and approval of dose escalation schedules. The platform has been adopted by both patients and caregivers alike with enthusiasm, and satisfaction levels are being actively assessed. Patient reported information is analyzed to build personalized trajectories and allow further individualized decision support. Conclusion: The StuffThatWorks “clinics” application, when adapted to drug therapy for obesity, functions as a granular, sequential reporting platform that creates a basis for remote management. The system generates value by saving physician time, improving patient-caregiver interactions, and building a database that allows for effective long-term management at the large scale necessary to tackle the epidemic proportions of obesity worldwide.

N2  - Background and Aim Statement: Smartwatches are increasingly accurate at detecting vital signs, are inexpensive and easy to operate, and hold promise as tools for remote patient monitoring (RPM). The COVID pandemic has highlighted the potential safety benefits of post-discharge RPM in the ED, especially in remote/rural settings. This study aimed to determine the feasibility characteristics of smartwatches in health status tracking for post-COVID patients. Measures and Design: This prospective feasibility trial enrolled patients rehabilitating at home from acute COVID in remote/rural Alberta. Patients were asked to wear a Fitbit Charge 2 device continuously and device metrics were extracted for analysis (e.g. heart rate, sleep, and activity). Electronic patient reported outcome measures (e-PROMS) for mental (bi-weekly) and physical (daily) health were collected via SMS text and email. Exit surveys and semistructured interviews evaluated the patient experience. The primary outcome was proportion of time (study-hours) with usable heart rate data. Secondary measures included completion rate for e-PROMs, patient satisfaction, patient-perceived clinical utility and mental health impacts. Evaluation/results: Of 17 eligible patients, 11 agreed to participate. The mean age was 52 yrs and 73% were female. Five patients (45%) were hospitalized (avg. stay 41 days) and 4 required mechanical ventilation; 6 already owned a smartwatch. The most prominent physical symptoms were fatigue, muscle weakness, headache, and dyspnea. On average, patients had moderate to severe anxiety (GAD 7 = 15.8), depression (PHQ-9 = 19.9), and stress (PSS = 26.6). A total of 21,040 patient-hours were monitored, averaging 1913 hrs per patient (SD = 1396). Heart rate data was usable for 83% of studyhours. Surveys were completed 83% and 72% of the time for mental and physical health, respectively. Survey scores were favorable for usability/acceptability (3.9/7), perceived clinical utility (3.5/7) and mental health impacts (3.8/7). Interviews revealed overall positive patient experience with varying concerns about data privacy/security. Discussion/impact: Smartwatches are feasible tools for RPM, especially given their usability, affordability, and patient acceptance. We will present preliminary estimates for longitudinal associations between smartwatch parameters and e-PROMS. Future work will aim to develop tools for predicting and preventing ED visits/revisits with continuously collected smartwatch data and machine learning.

N2  - Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a non-invasive technique for recording human vital signs. PPG is normally recorded by wearable devices that are prone to artifacts. This results in signal corruption that decreases measurement accuracy. Thus, a signal quality assessment (SQA) system is essential in obtaining reliable measurements. Conventionally, SQA is mainly driven by human-knowledge and supervised through experts' annotations. However, they are not tailored for the particularities of the domain applications. Hence, we propose a machine-aided SQA framework that generates respective quality criteria for applications. By using the proposed approach, quality criteria can be easily trained for different applications. Then, quality assessment can be applied to several PPG-based physiological signals telemonitoring. Compared with conventional approaches, the proposed system has a higher rejection rate for high-error signals and a lower mean absolute error is achieved when estimating heart rate (-3.06 BPM), determining respiration rate (-1.36 BPM), and predicting hypertension (+24%). The proposed method enhances accuracy in monitoring physiological signals and thus is suitable for healthcare applications.

N2  - To develop intelligent wearable protection systems is of great significance to human health engineering. An ideal intelligent air filtration system should possess reliable filtration efficiency, low pressure drop, healthcare monitoring function, and man-machine interactive capability. However, no existing intelligent protection system covers all these essential aspects. Herein, we developed an intelligent wearable filtration system (IWFS) via advanced nanotechnology and machine learning. Based on the triboelectric mechanism, the fabricated IWFS exhibits a long-lasting high particle filtration efficiency and bacteria protection efficiency of 99% and 100%, respectively, with a low-pressure drop of 5.8 mmH2O. Correspondingly, the charge accumulation of the optimized IWFS (87 nC) increased to 3.5 times that of the pristine nanomesh, providing a significant enhancement of the particle filtration efficiency. Theoretical principles, including the enhancement of the β-phase and the lower surface potential of the modified nanomesh, were quantitatively investigated by molecular dynamics simulation, band theory, and Kelvin probe force microscopy. Furthermore, we endowed the IWFS with a healthcare monitoring function and man-machine interactive capability through machine learning and wireless transmission technology. Crucial physiological signals of people, including breath, cough, and speaking signals, were detected and classified, with a high recognition rate of 92%; the fabricated IWFS can collect healthcare data and transmit voice commands in real time without hindrance by portable electronic devices. The achieved IWFS not only has practical significance for human health management but also has great theoretical value for advanced wearable systems.

N2  - Background: Many research studies seek to improve vital sign monitoring to enhance the conditions under which doctors and caregivers track patients’ health. Non-invasive and contactless monitoring has emerged as an optimal solution for this problem, with telemedicine, self-monitoring, and well- being tools being the next generation of technology in the biomedical field. However, there is worldwide concern about the general purpose and bias towards a certain demographic group of these techniques. In particular, skin tone and the accuracy of monitoring dark skin tone groups have been key questions among researchers, with the lack of results and studies contributing to this uncertainty. Methods: This paper proposes a benchmark for remote monitoring solution against a medical device across different skin tone people. Around 330 videos from 90 different patients were analyzed, and Heart Rate and Heart Rate Variability were compared across different subgroups. The Fitzpatrick scale (1-6) was used to classify participants into three skin tone groups: 1 and 2; 3 and 4; 5 and 6. Results: The results showed that our proposed methodology was able to estimate heart rate with a mean absolute error of 3 bpm across all samples and subgroups. Moreover, for Heart Rate Variability (HRV) metrics, we achieved the following results, in terms of Mobility Assistive Equipment (MAE): HRV-IBI (Inter-Beat-Interval) of 10 ms; HRV-SDNN (Standard Deviation of Normal to Normal heartbeats) of 14 ms and HRV-RMSSD (Root Mean Square of Successive Differences between normal heartbeats) of 22 ms. No significant performance decrease was found for any skin tone group, and there was no error trend towards a certain group. Conclusions: The study showed that our methodology meets acceptable agreement levels for the proposed metrics and is well-suited for users who want to understand their general health and wellness. Furthermore, the experiments showed that skin tone had no impact on the results, which remained within the same range across all groups.

N2  - In this study, Box-Behnken design combining seven factors at three levels were used to optimize the elimination of CI Reactive Red 66 in artificial seawater, by the combination of eco-friendly bio-sorbents and acclimated halotolerant microbial strain. Results showed that macro-algae and cuttlebone (2 %) were the best natural bio-sorbent. Additionally, the selected halotolerant strain able to rapidly remove dye was identified as Shewanella algae B29. The optimization process revealed that decolourization of CI Reactive Red 66 yields reached 91.04 % under the following variable values: dyes concentration (100 mg/l), salinity (30 g/l), peptone (2 %), pH (5), algae C (3 %), cuttlebone (1.5 %) and agitation (150 rpm). The whole genome analysis of S. algae B29 demonstrated the presence of several genes coding for valuable enzymes involved in textile dyes biotransformation, adaptation to stress as well as biofilm formation implying its potential use in biological textile wastewater treatment.

N2  - Background: LINK-HF study has shown that multivariate physiological telemetry from a wearable sensor combined with machine learning can provide accurate early detection of impending heart failure (HF) hospitalization. Whether early intervention based on predictive data generated through artificial intelligence (AI) analytical methods could improve outcomes in HF is not known. Methods: The LINK-HF2 study consists of two phases. The completed, non-randomized vanguard phase enrolled 27 patients with HF at 2 VA sites, and the ongoing main randomized phase will enroll 240 patients at 5 VA sites. The predictive AI system used in this study is a cloud-based analytic platform that generates a multivariate change index (MCI) to identify changes in observed physiological patterns that deviate from the expected normal behavior. Results: In the vanguard phase, comprehensive implementation program was developed and examined integration of non-invasive remote monitoring and subsequent algorithmic response to the clinical workflow. Clinicians responded to notifications within 24 hours in 95% of instances and clinical action was taken in 25% of instances. Challenges included over-alerting, time needed for data review, staffing, and deference to other providers. The results of the vanguard phase were used to make the following protocol adjustments: 1. Refinement of the algorithmic response to predictive alerts (Figure 1); 2. Expansion of clinician education; 3. Improved education of study subjects on the meaning of predictive notifications; and 4. Aggregating repeated MCI alerts within 72 hours into a single event.In the randomized phase of LINK-HF2, 240 subjects with HF will be fitted with the non-invasive monitor and randomized to either an active arm, in which notifications will be communicated to clinical providers and followed by an algorithmic response, or to a control arm where notifications will not be communicated to the clinical team. Study outcomes will be: 1. HF hospitalization, 2. All-cause hospitalization, 3. Hospitalization length, 4. Health-related quality of life (KCCQ-12, VAS), 5. Cost of medical care. Conclusions: The LINK-HF2 study will provide clinical utility data for and approach where algorithmic response will be taken to AI predictive analytics derived from multivariate physiological telemetry from a wearable sensor

N2  - Intelligent sensors have attracted substantial attention for various applications, including wearable electronics, artificial intelligence, healthcare monitoring, and human-machine interactions. However, there still remains a critical challenge in developing a multifunctional sensing system for complex signal detection and analysis in practical applications. Here, we develop a machine learning-combined flexible sensor for real-time tactile sensing and voice recognition through laser-induced graphitization. The intelligent sensor with a triboelectric layer can convert local pressure to an electrical signal through a contact electrification effect without external bias, which has a characteristic response behavior when exposed to various mechanical stimuli. With the special patterning design, a smart human-machine interaction controlling system composed of a digital arrayed touch panel is constructed to control electronic devices. Based on machine learning, the real-time monitoring and recognition of the changes of voice are achieved with high accuracy. The machine learning-empowered flexible sensor provides a promising platform for the development of flexible tactile sensing, real-time health detection, human-machine interaction, and intelligent wearable devices.

N2  - Wearable electrochemical sensors have attracted tremendous attention and have been experiencing rapid growth in recent years. Sweat, one of the most suitable biological fluids for non-invasive monitoring, contains various chemical elements relating abundant information about human health conditions. In this work, a new type of non-invasive and highly stretchable potentiometric sweat sensor was developed based on all-solid-state ion-selective electrode (ISE) coupled with poly(dimethylsiloxane; PDMS) and polyurethane (PU). This highly stretchable composite of PDMS-PU allows the sensor to be robust, with the PDMS providing a flexible backbone and the PU enhancing the adhesion between the electrodes and the substrate. In addition, graphene–carbon nanotube (CNT) network 3D nanomaterials were introduced to modify the ion selective membrane (ISM) in order to increase the charge transfer activity of the ISEs, which also could minimize the formation of water layers on the electrode surface, as such nanomaterials are highly hydrophobic. As a result, the sensor demonstrated a wide detection range of NH4+ from 10−6 M to 10−1 M with high stability and sensitivity—showing a high sensitivity of 59.6 ± 1.5 mV/log [NH4+] and an LOD lower than 10−6 M. Under a strain of 40%, the sensor still showed a sensitivity of 42.7 ± 3.1 mV/log [NH4+]. The proposed highly stretchable and robust electrochemical sweat sensor provides a new choice for wearable-device-based personal daily healthcare management beyond hospital-centric healthcare monitoring.

N2  - Current remote monitoring of COVID-19 patients relies on manual symptom reporting, which is highly dependent on patient compliance. In this research, we present a machine learning (ML)-based remote monitoring method to estimate patient recovery from COVID-19 symptoms using automatically collected wearable device data, instead of relying on manually collected symptom data. We deploy our remote monitoring system, namely eCOVID, in two COVID-19 telemedicine clinics. Our system utilizes a Garmin wearable and symptom tracker mobile app for data collection. The data consists of vitals, lifestyle, and symptom information which is fused into an online report for clinicians to review. Symptom data collected via our mobile app is used to label the recovery status of each patient daily. We propose a ML-based binary patient recovery classifier which uses wearable data to estimate whether a patient has recovered from COVID-19 symptoms. We evaluate our method using leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation, and find that Random Forest (RF) is the top performing model. Our method achieves an F1-score of 0.88 when applying our RF-based model personalization technique using weighted bootstrap aggregation. Our results demonstrate that ML-assisted remote monitoring using automatically collected wearable data can supplement or be used in place of manual daily symptom tracking which relies on patient compliance.

N2  - Background: Consumer satisfaction is largely dependent on convenience, efficiency, and quality, and healthcare is no outlier. Technological advancements, such as the use of artificial intelligence or virtual visit appointments, is emerging as a new form of healthcare provided. While these technologies have existed far before the COVID-19 pandemic, it has expedited the mass population's acclimation to digital therapeutics within healthcare. One such technology is remote patient monitoring (RPM) which allow healthcare providers to track and follow a patient's health status without their physical presence in a healthcare setting. RPM can be achieved through different mediums such as wearable devices, sensors, and mobile applications. RPM appears to “keep up with the times” as it allows patients to be in the comfort of their own home, provides real time feedback to providers, and improves patient health. Purpose: Previous studies of RPM programs explore their efficacy. Studies show that RPM programs can potentially have large benefits within the healthcare ecosystem as they can lead to lower number of hospitalizations, decrease risk for readmissions, and reduce costs. However, limited research delves into the factors that affect patients' engagement with an RPM program. Therefore, the purpose of this investigation is to assess factors that affect user engagement with the implementation of an innovative RPM program. Description: GetWell Loop (GWL) is a mobile health application serving as an RPM program within the Froedtert Health system where post-discharge hospitalized patients had the option of being enrolled in the GWL service. Through this mobile app, patients were able to update their providers regarding their day-to-day health status through virtual questionnaires, submit questions, and receive feedback in real time. All inpatient hospital discharges within the Froedtert Health system between March 2020 - November 2020 were stratified on readmission risk (low, medium, high). Low-risk patients were offered access to GWL, while moderate-risk and highrisk patients were offered access to GWL and the conventional care coordination. Demographic data was obtained from EPIC, while GWL specific usage was obtained from the GWL application. Various demographic variables were being analyzed such as patient age, patient sex, marital status, and risk level for hospital readmission. Engagement was defined as an engagement score of greater than 50%. This number is a calculation of the number of touchpoints the user engaged with the application compared to the total number of touchpoints offered by the GWL application. Univariate and chisquared analysis was used to examine demographic and user differences between users who engaged in the application and those who did not. Multivariate analysis was then run to control for all factors to determine true significance. Conclusions: Preliminary data suggests that patients with a low risk level for readmission are approximately two times more likely to be engaged with GWL than high risk level patients. There were no significant differences in engagement between age, sex, race, language, insurance provider type, or area of deprivation index Information from this study can help inform health systems on how to better implement such technologies more appropriately and efficiently. Maximizing the understanding of when and where RPM programs are the most useful can help towards achieving better patient care, higher patient satisfaction, and improved outcomes. (Figure Presented).

U1  - The rapid development of flexible electronic technology has led to the in-depth study of flexible wearable sensors to achieve accurate sensing under different external stimuli. However, it is still a huge challenge to develop hydrogel-based wearable skin-like sensors with super ductility, high sensitivity, and self-healing properties. Herein, the Ti3C2 type of MXene was synthesized, and the Ag/MXene nanocomplexes were incorporated into polyvinyl alcohol-borax matrix to construct a novel composite hydrogel as the multifunctional nanofillers, which could bring both improved properties and novel functionalities. The Ag/MXene-Poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogel displayed integrated merits of highly strain sensitive (GF = 3.26), self-healing (within 10 min, 91% healing efficiency), and excellent antibacterial activity. The hydrogel could be assembled into a wearable skin-like sensor to monitor human movement, including large deformations (finger, elbow, wrist, and knee bending) and tiny deformations (mouth’s movement and throat vocalization) in real time. Therefore, this work shed a new light on the development of flexible wearable skin-like sensors for the personalized healthcare monitoring, human–machine interfaces, and artificial intelligence.

N2  - Cardiovascular diseases represent the leading cause of death worldwide. Thus, cardiovascular rehabilitation programs are crucial to mitigate the deaths caused by this condition each year, mainly in patients with coronary artery disease. COVID-19 was not only a challenge in this area but also an opportunity to open remote or hybrid versions of these programs, potentially reducing the number of patients who leave rehabilitation programs due to geographical/time barriers. This paper presents a method for building a cardiovascular rehabilitation prediction model using retrospective and prospective data with different features using stacked machine learning, transfer feature learning, and the joint distribution adaptation tool to address this problem. We illustrate the method over a Chilean rehabilitation center, where the prediction performance results obtained for 10-fold cross-validation achieved error levels with an NMSE of (Formula presented.) and an (Formula presented.) of (Formula presented.), where the best-achieved performance was an error level with a normalized mean squared error of 0.008 and an (Formula presented.) up to (Formula presented.). The results are encouraging for remote cardiovascular rehabilitation programs because these models could support the prioritization of remote patients needing more help to succeed in the current rehabilitation phase.

N2  - (1) Background: We present the protocol of a randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the benefit of a novel clinical decision support system for the management of patients with COVID-19. (2) Methods: The study will recruit up to 500 participants (250 cases and 250 controls). Both groups will receive the conventional telephone follow-up protocol by primary care and will also be provided with access to a mobile application, in which they will be able to report their symptoms three times a day. In addition, patients in the active group will receive a wearable smartwatch and a pulse oximeter at home for real-time monitoring. The measured data will be visualized by primary care and emergency health service professionals, allowing them to detect in real time the progression and complications of the disease in order to promote early therapeutic interventions based on their clinical judgement. (3) Results: Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the Drug Research Ethics Committee of the Valladolid East Health Area (CASVE-NM-21-516). The results obtained from this study will form part of the thesis of two PhD students and will be disseminated through publication in a peer-reviewed journal. (4) Conclusions: The implementation of this telemonitoring system can be extrapolated to patients with other similar diseases, such as chronic diseases, with a high prevalence and need for close monitoring.

N2  - Background: Remote health monitoring technologies gained interest in the context of COVID-19 pandemic with potential for contactless monitoring of clinical patient status. Here, we examined whether vital parameters can be determined in a contactless manner using a novel smartphone-based technology called remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) and compared with comparable certified medical devices. Methods: We enrolled a total of 150 normotensive adults in this comparative cross-sectional validation study. We used an advanced machine learning algorithm in the WellFie application to create computational models that predict reference systolic, diastolic blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and respiratory rate (RR) from facial blood flow data. This study compared the predictive accuracy of smartphone-based, rPPG-enabled WellFie application with comparable certified medical devices. Results: When compared with reference standards, on average our models predicted systolic blood pressure (BP) with an accuracy of 93.94%, diastolic BP with an accuracy of 92.95%, HR with an accuracy of 97.34%, RR with accuracy of 84.44%. For the WellFie application, the relative mean absolute percentage error (RMAPE) for HR was 2.66%, for RR was 15.66%, for systolic BP was 6.06%, and for diastolic BP was 7.05%. Conclusion: Our results on normotensive adults demonstrates that rPPG technology-enabled Wellfie application can determine BP, HR, RR in normotensive participants with an accuracy that is comparable to clinical standards. WellFie smartphone application based on rPPG technology offers a convenient contactless video-based remote solution that could be used in any modern smartphone.

KW  - telerehabilitation
N2  - Neurological diseases including stroke and neurodegenerative disorders cause a hefty burden on the healthcare system. Survivors experience significant impairment in mobility and daily activities, which requires extensive rehabilitative interventions to assist them to regain lost skills and restore independence. The advent of remote rehabilitation architecture and enabling technology mandates the elaboration of sensing mechanisms tailored to individual clinical needs. This study aims to review current trends in the application of sensing mechanisms in remote monitoring and rehabilitation in neurological diseases, and to provide clinical insights to develop bespoke sensing mechanisms. A systematic search was performed using the PubMED database to identify 16 papers published for the period between 2018 to 2022. Teleceptive sensors (56%) were utilized more often than wearable proximate sensors (50%). The most commonly used modality was infrared (38%) and acceleration force (38%), followed by RGB color, EMG, light and temperature, and radio signal. The strategy adopted to improve the sensing mechanism included a multimodal sensor, the application of multiple sensors, sensor fusion, and machine learning. Most of the stroke studies utilized biofeedback control systems (78%) while the majority of studies for neurodegenerative disorders used sensors for remote monitoring (57%). Functional assessment tools that the sensing mechanism may emulate to produce clinically valid information were proposed and factors affecting user adoption were described. Lastly, the limitations and directions for further development were discussed.

N2  - Hypertension, or elevated blood pressure (BP), is a marker for many cardiovascular diseases and can lead to life threatening conditions such as heart failure, coronary artery disease and stroke. Several techniques have recently been proposed and investigated for non-invasive BP monitoring. The increasing desire for telemonitoring solutions that allow patients to manage their own conditions from home has accelerated the development of new BP monitoring techniques. In this review, we present the recent progress in non-invasive blood pressure monitoring solutions emphasizing clinical validation and trade-offs between available techniques. We introduce the current BP measurement techniques with their underlying operating principles. New promising proof-of-concept studies are presented and recent modeling and machine learning approaches for improved BP estimation are summarized. This aids discussions on how new BP monitors should evaluated in order to bring forth new home monitoring solutions in wearable form factor. Finally, we discuss on unresolved challenges in making convenient, reliable and validated BP monitoring solutions.

N2  - There are no clear guidelines for diuretic administration in heart failure (HF), and reliable markers are needed to tailor treatment. Continuous monitoring of multiple advanced physiological parameters during diuresis may allow better differentiation of patients into subgroups according to their responses. In this study, 29 HF patients were monitored during outpatient intravenous diuresis, using a noninvasive wearable multi-parameter monitor. Analysis of changes in these parameters during the course of diuresis aimed to recognize subgroups with different response patterns. Parameters did not change significantly, however, subgroup analysis of the last quartile of treatment showed significant differences in cardiac output, cardiac index, stroke volume, pulse rate, and systemic vascular resistance according to gender, and in systolic blood pressure according to habitus. Changes in the last quartile could be differentiated using k-means, a technique of unsupervised machine learning. Moreover, patients’ responses could be best clustered into four groups. Analysis of baseline parameters showed that two of the clusters differed by baseline parameters, body mass index, and diabetes status. To conclude, we show that physiological changes during diuresis in HF patients can be categorized into subgroups sharing similar response trends, making noninvasive monitoring a potential key to personalized treatment in HF.

N2  - The use of telemonitoring solutions via wearable sensors is believed to play a major role in the prevention and therapy of physical weakening in older adults. Despite the various studies found in the literature, some elements are still not well addressed, such as the study cohort, the experimental protocol, the type of research design, as well as the relevant features in this context. To this end, the objective of this pilot study was to investigate the efficacy of data-driven systems to characterize older individuals over 80 years of age with impaired physical function, during their daily routine and under unsupervised conditions. We propose a fully automated process which extracts a set of heterogeneous time-domain features from 24-hour files of acceleration and barometric data. After being statistically tested, the most discriminant features fed a group of machine learning classifiers to distinguish frail from non-frail subjects, achieving an accuracy up to 93.51%. Our analysis, conducted over 570 days of recordings, shows that a longitudinal study is important while using the proposed features, in order to ensure a highly specific diagnosis. This work may serve as a basis for the paradigm of future monitoring systems.

N2  - Digital health and telemonitoring have resulted in a wealth of information to be collected to monitor, manage, and improve human health. The multi-source mixed-frequency health data overwhelm the modeling capacity of existing statistical and machine learning models, due to many challenging properties. Although predictive analytics for big health data plays an important role in telemonitoring, there is a lack of rigorous prediction model that can automatically predicts patients’ health conditions, e.g., Disease Severity Indicators (DSIs), from multi-source mixed-frequency data. Sleep disorder is a prevalent cardiac syndrome that is characterized by abnormal respiratory patterns during sleep. Although wearable devices are available to administrate sleep studies at home, the manual scoring process to generate the DSI remains a bottleneck in automated monitoring and diagnosis of sleep disorder. To address the multi-fold challenges for precise prediction of the DSI from high-dimensional multi-source mixed-frequency data in sleep disorder, we propose a sparse linear mixed model that combines the modified Cholesky decomposition with group lasso penalties to enable joint group selection of fixed effects and random effects. A novel Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm integrated with an efficient Majorization Maximization (MM) algorithm is developed for model estimation of the proposed sparse linear mixed model with group variable selection. The proposed method was applied to the SHHS data for telemonitoring and diagnosis of sleep disorder and found that a few significant feature groups that are consistent with prior medical studies on sleep disorder. The proposed method also outperformed a few benchmark methods with the highest prediction accuracy.

N2  - Wearable devices that measure individual physiological parameters have become common companions of everyday life. The development of wearable medical device technologies that collect human data, combined with the analytical capabilities of artificial intelligence and machine learning, can improve human health. This paper discusses wearable gadgets currently used to diag-nose and treat chronic conditions. Artificial intelligence algorithms that analyze human health data collected from wearable devices are evaluated. Factors contributing to and impeding the use of wearable data for practical healthcare are summarized. Medical and economic needs, technical progress due to market competition and scientific interest, and the need to monitor employees’ health stimulate the further introduction of wearable devices in diagnosing and treating diseases. Technical flaws and legal issues limit the use of data from wearable devices for practical healthcare.

N2  - Background: Health-monitoring smart homes are becoming popular, with experts arguing that 9-to-5 health care services might soon become a thing of the past. However, no review has explored the landscape of smart home technologies that aim to promote physical activity and independent living among a wide range of age groups. Objective: This review aims to map published studies on smart home technologies aimed at promoting physical activity among the general and aging populations to unveil the state of the art, its potential, and the research gaps and opportunities. Methods: Articles were retrieved from 6 databases (PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, ACM Library, and Web of Science). The criteria for inclusion were that the articles must be user studies that dealt with smart home or Active Assisted Living technologies and physical activity, were written in English, and were published in peer-reviewed journals. In total, 3 researchers independently and collaboratively assessed the eligibility of the retrieved articles and elicited the relevant data and findings using tables and charts. Results: This review synthesized 20 articles that met the inclusion criteria, 70% (14/20) of which were conducted between 2018 and 2020. Three-quarters of the studies (15/20, 75%) were conducted in Western countries, with the United States accounting for 25% (5/20). Activities of daily living were the most studied (9/20, 45%), followed by physical activity (6/20, 30%), therapeutic exercise (4/20, 20%), and bodyweight exercise (1/20, 5%). K-nearest neighbor and naïve Bayes classifier were the most used machine learning algorithms for activity recognition, with at least 10% (2/20) of the studies using either algorithm. Ambient and wearable technologies were equally studied (8/20, 40% each), followed by robots (3/20, 15%). Activity recognition was the most common goal of the evaluated smart home technologies, with 55% (11/20) of the studies reporting it, followed by activity monitoring (7/20, 35%). Most studies (8/20, 40%) were conducted in a laboratory setting. Moreover, 25% (5/20) and 10% (2/20) were conducted in a home and hospital setting, respectively. Finally, 75% (15/20) had a positive outcome, 15% (3/20) had a mixed outcome, and 10% (2/20) had an indeterminate outcome. Conclusions: Our results suggest that smart home technologies, especially digital personal assistants, coaches, and robots, are effective in promoting physical activity among the young population. Although only few studies were identified among the older population, smart home technologies hold bright prospects in assisting and aiding older people to age in place and function independently, especially in Western countries, where there are shortages of long-term care workers. Hence, there is a need to do more work (eg, cross-cultural studies and randomized controlled trials) among the growing aging population on the effectiveness and acceptance of smart home technologies that aim to promote physical activity.

N2  - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is highly prevalent and is associated with a heavy burden on patients and health systems alike. Exacerbations of COPD (ECOPDs) are a leading cause of acute hospitalization among all adult chronic diseases. There is currently a paradigm shift in the way that ECOPDs are conceptualized. For the first time, objective physiological parameters are being used to define/classify what an ECOPD is (including heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation criteria) and therefore a mechanism to monitor and measure their changes, particularly in an outpatient ambulatory setting, are now of great value. In addition to pre-existing challenges on traditional ‘in-person’ health models such as geography and seasonal (ex. winter) impacts on the ability to deliver in-person visit-based care, the COVID-19 pandemic imposed additional stressors including lockdowns, social distancing, and the closure of pulmonary function labs. These health system stressors, combined with the new conceptualization of ECOPDs, rapid advances in sophistication of hardware and software, and a general openness by stakeholders to embrace this technology, have all influenced the propulsion of remote patient monitoring (RPM) and wearable technology in the modern care of COPD. The present article reviews the use of RPM and wearable technology in COPD. Context on the influences, factors and forces which have helped shape this health system innovation is provided. A focused summary of the literature of RPM in COPD is presented. Finally, the practical and ethical principles which must guide the transition of RPM in COPD into real-world clinical use are reviewed.

N2  - The present-day healthcare system operates on a 4G network, where the data rate needed for many IoT devices is impossible. Also, the latency involved in the network does not support the use of many devices in the network. The 5G-based cellular technology promises an effective healthcare management system with high speed and low latency. The 5G communication technology will replace the 4G technology to satisfy the increasing demand for high data rates. It incorporates higher frequency bands of around 100 MHz using millimetre waves and broadband modulation schemes. It is aimed at providing low latency while supporting real-time machine-to-machine communication. It requires a more significant number of antennas, with an average base station density three times higher than 4G. However, the rise in circuit and processing power for multiple antennas and transceivers deteriorates energy efficiency. Also, the data transmission power for 5G is three times higher than for 4G technology. One of the advanced processors used in today's mobile equipment is NVIDIA Tegra, which has a multicore system on chip (SoC) architecture with two ARM Cortex CPU cores to handle audio, images, and video. The state-of-the-art software coding using JAVA or Python has achieved smooth data transmission from mobile equipment, desktop or laptop through the internet with the support of 5G communication technology. This paper discusses some key areas related to 5G-based healthcare systems such as the architecture, antenna designs, power consumption, file protocols, security, and health implications of 5G networks.

N2  - The proliferation of Internet-connected health devices and the widespread availability of mobile connectivity have resulted in a wealth of reliable digital health data and the potential for delivering just-in-time interventions. However, leveraging these opportunities for health research requires the development and deployment of mobile health (mHealth) applications, which present significant technical challenges for researchers. While existing mHealth solutions have made progress in addressing some of these challenges, they often fall short in terms of time-to-use, affordability, and flexibility for personalization and adaptation. ZotCare aims to address these limitations by offering ready-to-use and flexible services, providing researchers with an accessible, cost-effective, and adaptable solution for their mHealth studies. This article focuses on ZotCare’s service orchestration and highlights its capabilities in creating a programmable environment for mHealth research. Additionally, we showcase several successful research use cases that have utilized ZotCare, both in the past and in ongoing projects. Furthermore, we provide resources and information for researchers who are considering ZotCare as their mHealth research solution.

N2  - Introduction: Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) has emerged as a powerful tool for rapid pathogen identification in clinical practice. However, the parameters used to interpret mNGS data, such as read count, genus rank, and coverage, lack explicit performance evaluation. In this study, the developed indicators as well as novel parameters were assessed for their performance in bacterium detection. Methods: We developed several relevant parameters, including 10M normalized reads, double-discard reads, Genus Rank Ratio, King Genus Rank Ratio, Genus Rank Ratio*Genus Rank, and King Genus Rank Ratio*Genus Rank. These parameters, together with frequently used read indicators including raw reads, reads per million mapped reads (RPM), transcript per kilobase per million mapped reads (TPM), Genus Rank, and coverage were analyzed for their diagnostic efficiency in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), a common source for detecting eight bacterium pathogens: Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Hemophilus influenzae, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Aspergillus fumigatus. Results: The results demonstrated that these indicators exhibited good diagnostic efficacy for the eight pathogens. The AUC values of all indicators were almost greater than 0.9, and the corresponding sensitivity and specificity values were almost greater than 0.8, excepted coverage. The negative predictive value of all indicators was greater than 0.9. The results showed that the use of double-discarded reads, Genus Rank Ratio*Genus Rank, and King Genus Rank Ratio*Genus Rank exhibited better diagnostic efficiency than that of raw reads, RPM, TPM, and in Genus Rank. These parameters can serve as a reference for interpreting mNGS data of BALF. Moreover, precision filters integrating our novel parameters were built to detect the eight bacterium pathogens in BALF samples through machine learning. Summary: In this study, we developed a set of novel parameters for pathogen identification in clinical mNGS based on reads and ranking. These parameters were found to be more effective in diagnosing pathogens than traditional approaches. The findings provide valuable insights for improving the interpretation of mNGS reports in clinical settings, specifically in BALF analysis.

N2  - Telemedicine and remote patient monitoring (RPM) systems have been gaining interest and received adaptation in healthcare sectors since the COVID-19 pandemic due to their efficiency and capability to deliver timely healthcare services while containing COVID-19 transmission. These systems were developed using the latest technology in wireless sensors, medical devices, cloud computing, mobile computing, telecommunications, and machine learning technologies. In this article, a real-time remote patient monitoring system is proposed with an accessible, compact, accurate, and low-cost design. The implemented system is designed to an end-to-end communication interface between medical practitioners and patients. The objective of this study is to provide remote healthcare services to patients who need ongoing care or those who have been discharged from the hospital without affecting their daily routines. The developed monitoring system was then evaluated on 1177 records from MIMIC-III clinical dataset (aged between 19 and 99 years). The performance analysis of the proposed system achieved 88.7% accuracy in generating alerts with logistic regression classification algorithm. This result reflects positively on the quality and robustness of the proposed study. Since the processing time of the proposed system is less than 2 minutes, it can be stated that the system has a high computational speed and is convenient to use in real-time monitoring. Furthermore, the proposed system will fulfil to cover the lower doctor-to-patient ratio by monitoring patients from remote locations and aged people who reside in their residences.

N2  - This study aims to develop machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict exercise exertion levels using physiological parameters collected from wearable devices. Real-time ECG, oxygen saturation, pulse rate, and revolutions per minute (RPM) data were collected at three intensity levels during a 16-minute cycling exercise. Parallel to this, throughout each exercise session, the study subjects' ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) were gathered once per minute. Each 16-minute exercise session was divided into a total of eight 2-minute windows. Each exercise window was labeled as "high exertion," or "low exertion" classes based on the self-reported RPEs. For each window, the gathered ECG data were used to derive the heart rate variability (HRV) features in the temporal and frequency domains. Additionally, each window's averaged RPMs, heart rate, and oxygen saturation levels were calculated to form all the predictive features. The minimum redundancy maximum relevance algorithm was used to choose the best predictive features. Top selected features were then used to assess the accuracy of ten ML classifiers to predict the next window's exertion level. The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) model showed the highest accuracy of 85.7% and the highest F1 score of 83%. An ensemble model showed the highest area under the curve (AUC) of 0.92. The suggested method can be used to automatically track perceived exercise exertion in real-time.

N2  - Introduction: Early detection of clinical deterioration in oncology patients is crucial and challenging. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status is frequently used but is often a subjective assessment open to varied interpretations. This project implemented a telemedicine system to monitor alterations in vital signs, with the aim of evaluating whether such data could predict real-time ECOG performance status and 1-year survival using machine learning models. Methods: VitalPatch, a Class IIa medical device, was utilized as the monitoring system, continuously tracking seven key parameters (respiratory frequency, oxygen saturation, heart rate, temperature, single-lead ECG data, posture, step count, and fall detection) in oncological high-risk patients over seven days. Laboratory and clinical assessments were also incorporated for comprehensive patient evaluation. We first performed Mann- Whitney U test to identify differences in terms of vital signs between different groups of patients. Then, we trained different machine learning models-logistic regression, random forest classifier, and XGBoost- to predict ECOG PS, C-reactive protein level (CRP) and survival status. To this end ECOG PS was categorized as 'high' (2-3) or 'low' (0-1), C-reactive protein level (CRP) was categorized as 'high' (values >50 mg/L) or 'low' (0- 10 mg/L), and survival status was determined one year postmonitoring. Finally, performance of the models was assessed using the F1 weighted score metric and the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC AUC). Results: Analysis of data from 28 patients indicated significant differences in mean heart rates between high and low ECOG PS scores (p = 0.0094) and high and low CRP levels (p = 0.027). The Random Forest model yielded promising predictions for ECOG (F1 score = 0.9124, ROC AUC = 0.900) and 1-year survival (F1 score = 0.771, ROC AUC = 0.800). Conclusions: This preliminary analysis indicates substantial potential to develop AI algorithms that utilize vital signs to determine ECOG PS and predict 1-year survival status, with heart rate being notably indicative. These results signify progress in leveraging telemedicine and remote monitoring to enhance patient care, particularly in oncology. Expanded research with larger populations is essential to corroborate these promising findings.

N2  - Parkinson’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by several motor symptoms that develop gradually: tremor, bradykinesia, limb rigidity, and gait and balance problems. While there is no cure, levodopa therapy has been shown to mitigate symptoms. A patient on levodopa experiences cycles in the severity of their symptoms, characterized by an ON state—when the drug is active—and an OFF state—when symptoms worsen as the drug wears off. The longitudinal progression of the disease is monitored using episodic assessments performed by trained physicians in the clinic, such as the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Lately, there has been an effort in the field to develop continuous, objective measures of motor symptoms based on wearable sensors and other remote monitoring devices. In this work, we present an effort towards such a solution that uses a single wearable inertial sensor to automatically assess the postural instability and gait disorder (PIGD) of a Parkinson’s disease patient. Sensor data was collected from two independent studies of subjects performing the UPDRS test and then used to train and validate a convolutional neural network model. Given the typical limited size of such studies we also employed the use of generative adversarial networks to improve the performance of deep-learning models that usually require larger amounts of data for training. We show that for a 2-min walk test, our method’s predicted PIGD scores can be used to identify a patient’s ON/OFF states better than a physician evaluated on the same criteria. This result paves the way for more reliable, continuous tracking of Parkinson’s disease symptoms.

N2  - Background: Depression is a common condition among cancer patients, across several points in the disease trajectory. Although presenting higher prevalence rates than the general population, it is often not reported or remains unnoticed. Moreover, somatic symptoms of depression are common in the oncological context and should not be dismissed as a general symptom of cancer. It becomes even more challenging to track psychological distress in the period after the treatment, where connection with the healthcare system typically becomes sporadic. The main goal of the FAITH project is to remotely identify and predict depressive symptoms in cancer survivors, based on a federated machine learning (ML) approach, towards optimization of privacy. Methods: FAITH will remotely analyse depression markers, predicting their negative trends. These markers will be treated in distinct categories, namely nutrition, sleep, activity and voice, assessed in part through wearable technologies. The study will include 300 patients who have had a previous diagnosis of breast or lung cancer and will be recruited 1 to 5 years after the end of primary cancer. The study will be organized as a 12-month longitudinal prospective observational cohort study, with monthly assessments to evaluate depression symptoms and quality of life among cancer survivors. The primary endpoint is the severity of depressive symptoms as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (Ham-D) at months 3, 6, 9 and 12. Secondary outcomes include self-reported anxiety and depression symptoms (HADS scale), and perceived quality of life (EORTC questionnaires), at baseline and monthly. Based on the predictive models gathered during the study, FAITH will also aim at further developing a conceptual federated learning framework, enabling to build machine learning models for the prediction and monitoring of depression without direct access to user’s personal data. Discussion: Improvements in the objectivity of psychiatric assessment are necessary. Wearable technologies can provide potential indicators of depression and anxiety and be used for biofeedback. If the FAITH application is effective, it will provide healthcare systems with a novel and innovative method to screen depressive symptoms in oncological settings. Trial registration: Trial ID: ISRCTN10423782. Date registered: 21/03/2022.

N2  - Substantial milestones have been attained in the field of heart failure (HF) diagnostics and therapeutics in the past several years that have translated into decreased mortality but a paradoxical increase in HF-related hospitalizations. With increasing data digitalization and access, remote monitoring via wearables and implantables have the potential to transform ambulatory care workflow, with a particular focus on reducing HF hospitalizations. Additionally, artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) have been increasingly employed at multiple stages of healthcare due to their power in assimilating and integrating multidimensional multimodal data and the creation of accurate prediction models. With the ever-increasing troves of data, the implementation of AI/ML algorithms could help improve workflow and outcomes of HF patients, especially time series data collected via remote monitoring. In this review, we sought to describe the basics of AI/ML algorithms with a focus on time series forecasting and the current state of AI/ML within the context of wearable technology in HF, followed by a discussion of the present limitations, including data integration, privacy, and challenges specific to AI/ML application within healthcare.

N2  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, the patient care delivery paradigm rapidly shifted to remote technological solutions. Rising rates of life expectancy of older people, and deaths due to chronic diseases (CDs) such as cancer, diabetes and respiratory disease pose many challenges to healthcare. While the feasibility of Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) with a Smart Healthcare Monitoring (SHM) framework was somewhat questionable before the COVID-19 pandemic, it is now a proven commodity and is on its way to becoming ubiquitous. More health organizations are adopting RPM to enable CD management in the absence of individual monitoring. The current studies on SHM have reviewed the applications of IoT and/or Machine Learning (ML) in the domain, their architecture, security, privacy and other network related issues. However, no study has analyzed the AI and ubiquitous computing advances in SHM frameworks. The objective of this research is to identify and map key technical concepts in the SHM framework. In this context an interesting and meaningful classification of the research articles surveyed for this work is presented. The comprehensive and systematic review is based on the “Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis” (PRISMA) approach. A total of 2540 papers were screened from leading research archives from 2016 to March 2021, and finally, 50 articles were selected for review. The major advantages, developments, distinctive architectural structure, components, technical challenges and possibilities in SHM are briefly discussed. A review of various recent cloud and fog computing based architectures, major ML implementation challenges, prospects and future trends is also presented. The survey primarily encourages the data driven predictive analytics aspects of healthcare and the development of ML models for health empowerment.

N2  - India as a country of contrast and diversity has witnessed digital evolution in different waves and stages. The technology is already an integral part of lives of millions in India; however, its application in the health management remains limited unlike developed economies. COVID-19 pandemic has plunged the country into universal, regional, or local lockdowns repeatedly since the last year. An unexpected and unforeseen impact of this has been the usage of technology for doctor-patient interactions through telemedicine. Hitherto limited to certain pockets, virtual interactions with doctors, ordering laboratory investigations through an application or procuring medicines through internet, are now part of mainstream patient behavior. This is a crucial change in the mindset but requires a lot more to be done at various levels to tap its full potential with rheumatologists being at the forefront and leading the change in their specialty. The pool of rheumatologists is very small and mostly concentrated in few urban areas, leading to diagnostic delay, suboptimal treatment, and poor outcomes. Technology could, therefore, become a catalyst for change and harbinger for greater clinician access. There are plenty of discussions about the impact and potential of deep learning, artificial intelligence, remote monitoring with wearables, etc., but plenty of them may not be relevant to Indian patients in the current scenario. Hence, the context, relevance, and applicability are the key for rheumatologists when making a judgment.

N2  - This research work delves into the dynamics of investor decision-making and the efficacy of forecasting models used to comprehend market movements. The study aims to determine suitable models that can elucidate agent behavior, enabling easier decision-making through accurate anticipation of future asset prices. Artificial intelligence models, specifically Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms, are employed to gain deeper insights into asset price variations and their future evolution. A comparative analysis between classical models and advanced artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms reveals the limitations of classical statistical models, as they rely on assumptions that often do not hold in the context of financial series. Consequently, their predictive capacity for new data is compromised. In contrast, the integration of AI, particularly RNN, allows us to overcome the assumption of market efficiency and successfully model the behavior of irrational agents who engage in trading based on rumors and false news. By harnessing the power of AI, this study lays the groundwork for a more accurate and robust understanding of investor behavior and market movements. The findings present significant implications for the financial sector, offering an enhanced approach to decision-making and risk management. The intelligent monitoring system developed through this research holds great potential for fostering smarter, data-driven decisions and anticipating market trends, ultimately leading to improved performance and profitability.

N2  - On-skin patches that record biopotential and biomechanical signals are essential for wearable healthcare monitoring, clinical treatment, and human-machine interaction. To acquire wearing comfort and high-quality signals, patches with tissue-like softness, elastic recovery, damage tolerance, and robust bioelectronic interface are highly desired yet challenging to achieve. Here, we report a dry epidermal patch made from a supramolecular polymer (SESA) and an in situ transferred carbon nanotubes' percolation network. The polymer possesses a hybrid structure of copolymerized permanent scaffold permeated by multiple dynamic interactions, which imparts a desired mechanical response transition from elastic recoil to energy dissipation with increased elongation. Such SESA-based patches are soft (Young's modulus ∼0.1 MPa) and elastic within physiologically relevant strain levels (97% elastic recovery at 50% tensile strain), intrinsically mechanical-electrical damage-resilient (∼90% restoration from damage after 5 min), and interference-immune in dynamic signal acquisition (stretch, underwater, sweat). We demonstrate its versatile physiological sensing applications, including electrocardiogram recording under various disturbances, machine-learning-enabled hand-gesture recognition through electromyogram measurement, subtle radial artery pulse, and drastic knee kinematics sensing. This epidermal patch offers a promising noninvasive, long-duration, and ambulant bioelectronic interfacing with anti-interference robustness.

N2  - Heart rate at rest and exercise may predict cardiovascular risk. Heart rate variability is a measure of variation in time between each heartbeat, representing the balance between the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system and may predict adverse cardiovascular events. With advances in technology and increasing commercial interest, the scope of remote monitoring health systems has expanded. In this review, we discuss the concepts behind cardiac signal generation and recording, wearable devices, pros and cons focusing on accuracy, ease of application of commercial and medical grade diagnostic devices, which showed promising results in terms of reliability and value. Incorporation of artificial intelligence and cloud based remote monitoring have been evolving to facilitate timely data processing, improve patient convenience and ensure data security.

N2  - To avoid dire situations, the medical sector must develop various methods for quickly and accurately identifying infections in remote regions. The primary goal of the proposed work is to create a wearable device that uses the Internet of Things (IoT) to carry out several monitoring tasks. To decrease the amount of communication loss as well as the amount of time required to wait before detection and improve detection quality, the designed wearable device is also operated with a multi-objective framework. Additionally, a design method for wearable IoT devices is established, utilizing distinct mathematical approaches to solve these objectives. As a result, the monitored parametric values are saved in a different IoT application platform. Since the proposed study focuses on a multi-objective framework, state design and deep learning (DL) optimization techniques are combined, reducing the complexity of detection in wearable technology. Wearable devices with IoT processes have even been included in current methods. However, a solution cannot be duplicated using mathematical approaches and optimization strategies. Therefore, developed wearable gadgets can be applied to real-time medical applications for fast remote monitoring of an individual. Additionally, the proposed technique is tested in real-time, and an IoT simulation tool is utilized to track the compared experimental results under five different situations. In all of the case studies that were examined, the planned method performs better than the current state-of-the-art methods.

N2  - In recent years, the global Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) industry has evolved at a tremendous speed. Security and privacy are key concerns on the IoMT, owing to the huge scale and deployment of IoMT networks. Machine learning (ML) and blockchain (BC) technologies have significantly enhanced the capabilities and facilities of healthcare 5.0, spawning a new area known as “Smart Healthcare.” By identifying concerns early, a smart healthcare system can help avoid long-term damage. This will enhance the quality of life for patients while reducing their stress and healthcare costs. The IoMT enables a range of functionalities in the field of information technology, one of which is smart and interactive health care. However, combining medical data into a single storage location to train a powerful machine learning model raises concerns about privacy, ownership, and compliance with greater concentration. Federated learning (FL) overcomes the preceding difficulties by utilizing a centralized aggregate server to disseminate a global learning model. Simultaneously, the local participant keeps control of patient information, assuring data confidentiality and security. This article conducts a comprehensive analysis of the findings on blockchain technology entangled with federated learning in healthcare. 5.0. The purpose of this study is to construct a secure health monitoring system in healthcare 5.0 by utilizing a blockchain technology and Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to detect any malicious activity in a healthcare network and enables physicians to monitor patients through medical sensors and take necessary measures periodically by predicting diseases. The proposed system demonstrates that the approach is optimized effectively for healthcare monitoring. In contrast, the proposed healthcare 5.0 system entangled with FL Approach achieves 93.22% accuracy for disease prediction, and the proposed RTS-DELM-based secure healthcare 5.0 system achieves 96.18% accuracy for the estimation of intrusion detection.

N2  - Fragmentation of healthcare systems through limited cross-speciality communication and intermittent, intervention-based care, without insight into follow-up and compliance, results in poor patient experiences and potentially contributes to suboptimal outcomes. Data-driven tools and novel technologies have the capability to address these shortcomings, but insights from all stakeholders in the care continuum remain lacking. A structured online questionnaire was given to respondents (n = 1432) in nine global geographies to investigate attitudes to the use of data and novel technologies in the management of vascular disease. Patients with coronary or peripheral artery disease (n = 961), physicians responsible for their care (n = 345), and administrators/healthcare leaders with responsibility for commissioning/procuring cardiovascular services (n = 126) were included. Narrative themes arising from the survey included patients’ desire for more personalized healthcare, shared decision-making, and improved communication. Patients, administrators, and physicians perceived and experienced deficiencies in continuity of care, and all acknowledged the potential for data-driven techniques and novel technologies to address some of these shortcomings. Further, physicians and administrators saw the ‘upstream’ segment of the care journey—before diagnosis, at point of diagnosis, and when determining treatment—as key to enabling tangible improvements in patient experience and outcomes. Finally, despite acceptance that data sharing is critical to the success of such interventions, there remains persistent issues related to trust and transparency. The current fragmented care continuum could be improved and streamlined through the adoption of advanced data analytics and novel technologies, including diagnostic and monitoring techniques. Such an approach could enable the refocusing of healthcare from intermittent contacts and intervention-only focus to a more holistic patient view.

N2  - Conservation of biodiversity is critical for the coexistence of humans and the sustenance of other living organisms within the ecosystem. Identification and prioritization of specific regions to be conserved are impossible without proper information about the sites. Advanced monitoring agencies like the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) had accredited that the sum total of species that are now threatened with extinction is higher than ever before in the past and are progressing toward extinct at an alarming rate. Besides this, the conceptualized global responses to these crises are still inadequate and entail drastic changes. Therefore, more sophisticated monitoring and conservation techniques are required which can simultaneously cover a larger surface area within a stipulated time frame and gather a large pool of data. Hence, this study is an overview of remote monitoring methods in biodiversity conservation via a survey of evidence-based reviews and related studies, wherein the description of the application of some technology for biodiversity conservation and monitoring is highlighted. Finally, the paper also describes various transformative smart technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and/or machine learning algorithms for enhanced working efficiency of currently available techniques that will aid remote monitoring methods in biodiversity conservation.

N2  - Background: Spending less inpatient time on transplant wards has been shown to improve quality of life and outcomes after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (aHSCT). One of the major obstacles for early discharge after aHSCT is aside from frailty the high risk for infections and the need for monitoring of graft versus host disease. This requires frequent hospital visits which is in times of Covid19 often a challenge and patients express reluctancy due to the higher risk of disease transmission in congested outpatient clinics. Furthermore, structured data acquisition is missing, especially in the home care setting. Methods: We have developed a mobile phone application for aHSCT patients that allows for specific symptom reporting and, in combination with a wearable device for online monitoring of major vital signs in real time. The application captures currently more than 50 data points relevant for aHSCT and infectious disease monitoring. It is based on REACT/NATIVE and JSON coding and enables specific designs based on requirements. Data captured by the wearable devices and manual symptom reporting are displayed in a close to real time fashion on a browser-based dashboard to the physician in a comprehensive fashion to allow for trend assessment of all transplant relevant information. It provides a photo function to capture skin images which are displayed on the physicians dashboard. Daily symptom reporting can be performed as often as necessary by the patient and data from wearable device are obtained multiple times every hour. The mobile phone application runs on android and iOS devices. The physicians dashboard includes several decision buttons that capture time stamped diagnosis or treatment decisions to enable machine learning and pattern recognition. Results: Data from symptom reporting and wearable device are displayed on a dashboard to the responsible health care provider with only a minor time delay. With this platform we capture and display in addition to vital signs (pulse, breathing rate, oxygen saturation of the peripheral blood, body weight) and simple GvHD related symptom reporting information on the patient's physical activity, food intake, fluid intake, sleeping patterns, blood pressure and body temperature. The dashboard displays all transplant relevant information (HLA match, conditioning regimen, ABO incompatibility, CMV/EBV/Toxoplasmosis serology etc.) of the patient and of the donor and allows for a quick connection to the patient in case trends are reason for concern. It displays all data longitudinally over several days and therefore allows to observe trends and developments. Access to the dashboard is centre specific and secured by a dual verification process. Patient data are stored in HIPAA/PHIPA compliant fashion but storage can be adapted to country specific requirements. Conclusions: This application enables remote home monitoring of patients after aHSCT. It has been designed to improve quality of life by enabling more controlled home care and potentially earlier discharge. Both front ends are developed in a modular fashion and can easily be adapted to specific requirements for example after CD19 CAR T cell therapy or after autologous transplantation.

N2  - Introduction: Timely recognition of clinical deterioration in oncological patients remains challenging. Remote monitoring of vital signs may provide support to current clinical practices but need to be extensively tested before routine implementation in the oncological environment. In our pilot project a telemedicine system was implemented for the early detection of vital signs deterioration in oncological patients with a high risk for complications, without need for hospitalization. Main objectives were the evaluation of the sense of safety and well-being of patients at home and feasibility of remote monitoring. Methods: The used monitoring system is based on the IIa-class medical device VitalPatch (by VitalConnect) to monitor continuously in real-time 7 vital parameters for 7 days: respiratory frequency, heart rate, temperature, a single ECG lead, posture, number of steps and fall detection. An oximeter was integrated into the system and a smartphone was provided to each patient as gateway for data transmission. Eligible patients received the medical devices at home and were instructed by a specialized nurse. Access to clinical information and remote monitoring was ensured to the patient's family doctor and medical oncologist through an online platform with the support of a professional 24/7 emergency call center (responsible for the management of alerts based on predefined thresholds). At the end of the monitoring period, a 14-item questionnaire was administered to patients exploring their sense of safety, satisfaction with monitoring and usability of the device. Results: Thirty patients were monitored from October 2021 to July 2022. Median age at enrolment was 68.8 years (range 43 - 87). Most patients (78%) judged the devices very easy to use. The monitoring system increased the sense of safety of 96% of patients. The satisfaction with remote medical assistance was “very high” and “high” for 88% of patients. Remote monitoring information led to treatment change in 37% of patients. Five out of 30 patients had an acute event during the monitoring period, only 1 of them needed hospitalization. Conclusions: Remote monitoring of vital signs of oncological patients with high risk for complications was feasible and well perceived by all patients. Future studies need to evaluate the impact of home monitoring on patient outcome as well as the cost-effectiveness of this new approach.

N2  - Academics and the health community are paying much attention to developing smart remote patient monitoring, sensors, and healthcare technology. For the analysis of medical scans, various studies integrate sophisticated deep learning strategies. A smart monitoring system is needed as a proactive diagnostic solution that may be employed in an epidemiological scenario such as COVID-19. Consequently, this work offers an intelligent medicare system that is an IoT-empowered, deep learning-based decision support system (DSS) for the automated detection and categorization of infectious diseases (COVID-19 and pneumothorax). The proposed DSS system was evaluated using three independent standard-based chest X-ray scans. The suggested DSS predictor has been used to identify and classify areas on whole X-ray scans with abnormalities thought to be attributable to COVID-19, reaching an identification and classification accuracy rate of 89.58% for normal images and 89.13% for COVID-19 and pneumothorax. With the suggested DSS system, a judgment depending on individual chest X-ray scans may be made in approximately 0.01 s. As a result, the DSS system described in this study can forecast at a pace of 95 frames per second (FPS) for both models, which is near to real-time.

N2  - Chronic fluid overload is associated with morbidity and mortality in hemodialysis patients. Optimizing the diagnosis and treatment of fluid overload remains a priority for the nephrology community. Although current methods of assessing fluid status, such as bioimpedance and lung ultrasound, have prognostic and diagnostic value, no single system or technique can be used to maintain euvolemia. The difficulty in maintaining and assessing fluid status led to a publication by the Kidney Health Initiative in 2019 aimed at fostering innovation in fluid management therapies. This review article focuses on the current limitations in our assessment of extracellular volume, and the novel technology and methods that can create a new paradigm for fluid management. The cardiology community has published research on multiparametric wearable devices that can create individualized predictions for heart failure events. In the future, similar wearable technology may be capable of tracking fluid changes during the interdialytic period and enabling behavioral change. Machine learning methods have shown promise in the prediction of volume-related adverse events. Similar methods can be leveraged to create accurate, automated predictions of dry weight that can potentially be used to guide ultrafiltration targets and interdialytic weight gain goals.

N2  - Background: The cost of heart failure hospitalizations in the US alone is over USD 10 billion per year. Over 4 million Americans are hospitalized every year due to heart failure (HF), with a median length of stay of 4 days and an in-hospital mortality rate that exceeds 5%. Hospitalizations of patients with HF can be prevented by early detection of lung congestion. Our study assessed a new contact-free optical medical device used for the early detection of lung congestion. Methods: The Gili system is an FDA-cleared device used for measuring chest motion vibration data. Lung congestion in the study was assessed clinically and verified via two cardiologists. An algorithm was developed using machine learning techniques, and cross-validation of the findings was performed to estimate the accuracy of the algorithm. Results: A total of 227 patients were recruited (101 cases vs. 126 controls). The sensitivity and specificity for the device in our study were 0.91 (95% CI: 0.86–0.93) and 0.91 (95% CI: 0.87–0.94), respectively. In all instances, the observed estimates of PPVs and NPVs were at least 0.82 and 0.90, respectively. The accuracy of the algorithm was not affected by different covariates (including respiratory or valvular conditions). Conclusions: This study demonstrates the efficacy of a contact-free optical device for detecting lung congestion. Further validation of the study results across a larger and precise scale is warranted.

N2  - A continuous heart disease monitoring system is one of the significant applications specified by the Internet of Things (IoT). This goal might be achieved by combining sophisticated expert systems with extensive healthcare data on heart diseases. Several machine learning-based methods have recently been proven for predicting and diagnosing cardiac illness. However, these algorithms are unable to manage high-dimensional information due to the lack of a smart framework that can combine several sources to anticipate cardiac illness. The Fuzzy-Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model is used in this work to present a unique IoT-enabled heart disease prediction method. The benchmark data for the experiment came from public sources and collected via wearable IoT devices. An improved Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) called Population and Fitness-based HHO (PF-HHO) is utilized to select the best features, with the objective function of correlation maximization within the same class and correlation minimization among different classes. The scientific contributions of the health care monitoring system are depicted here that help to improve heart disease healthcare efficiency and also it can be reducing the death rate in the current world. The important section of this persistent healthcare mode is the real-world monitoring system. The simulation outcomes proved that the recommended approach is more successful at predicting heart illness than existing technologies.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) are at risk for the development of low cardiac output and other physiologic derangements, which could be detected early through continuous stroke volume (SV) measurement. Unfortunately, existing SV measurement methods are limited in the clinic because of their invasiveness (eg, thermodilution), location (eg, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging), or unreliability (eg, bioimpedance). Multimodal wearable sensing, leveraging the seismocardiogram, a sternal vibration signal associated with cardiomechanical activity, offers a means to monitoring SV conveniently, affordably, and continuously. However, it has not been evaluated in a population with significant anatomical and physiological differences (ie, children with CHD) or compared against a true gold standard (ie, cardiac magnetic resonance). Here, we present the feasibility of wearable estimation of SV in a diverse CHD population (N=45 patients). METHODS AND RESULTS: We used our chest-worn wearable biosensor to measure baseline ECG and seismocardiogram signals from patients with CHD before and after their routine cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging, and derived features from the measured signals, predominantly systolic time intervals, to estimate SV using ridge regression. Wearable signal features achieved acceptable SV estimation (28% error with respect to cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging) in a held-out test set, per cardiac output measurement guidelines, with a root-mean-square error of 11.48 mL and R2 of 0.76. Additionally, we observed that using a combination of electrical and cardiomechanical features surpassed the performance of either modality alone. CONCLUSIONS: A convenient wearable biosensor that estimates SV enables remote monitoring of cardiac function and may potentially help identify decompensation in patients with CHD.

N2  - Objective: With the increasing use of wearable healthcare devices for remote patient monitoring, reliable signal quality assessment (SQA) is required to ensure the high accuracy of interpretation and diagnosis on the recorded data from patients. Photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals non-invasively measured by wearable devices are extensively used to provide information about the cardiovascular system and its associated diseases. In this study, we propose an approach to optimize the quality assessment of the PPG signals. Methods: We used an ensemble-based feature selection scheme to enhance the prediction performance of the classification model to assess the quality of the PPG signals. Our approach for feature and subset size selection yielded the best-suited feature subset, which was optimized to differentiate between the clean and artifact corrupted PPG segments. Conclusion: A high discriminatory power was achieved between two classes on the test data by the proposed feature selection approach, which led to strong performance on all dependent and independent test datasets. We achieved accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity rates of higher than 0.93, 0.89, and 0.97, respectively, for dependent test datasets, independent of heartbeat type, i.e., atrial fibrillation (AF) or non-AF data including normal sinus rhythm (NSR), premature atrial contraction (PAC), and premature ventricular contraction (PVC). For independent test datasets, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity rates were greater than 0.93, 0.89, and 0.97, respectively, on PPG data recorded from AF and non-AF subjects. These results were found to be more accurate than those of all of the contemporary methods cited in this work. Significance: As the results illustrate, the advantage of our proposed scheme is its robustness against dynamic variations in the PPG signal during long-term 14-day recordings accompanied with different types of physical activities and a diverse range of fluctuations and waveforms caused by different individual hemodynamic characteristics, and various types of recording devices. This robustness instills confidence in the application of the algorithm to various kinds of wearable devices as a reliable PPG signal quality assessment approach.

N2  - Purpose: Parkinson’s Disease comes on top among neurodegenerative diseases affecting 10 million worldwide. To detect Parkinson’s Disease in a prior state, gait analysis is an effective choice. However, monitoring of Parkinson’s Disease using gait analysis is time consuming and exhaustive for patients and physicians. To assess severity of symptoms, a rating scale called Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale is used. It determines mild and severe cases. Today, Parkinson’s Disease severity assessment is made in gait laboratories and by manual examination. These are time consuming and it is costly for health institutions to build and maintain laboratories. By using low-cost wearables and an effective model, aforementioned problems can be solved. Methods: We provide a computerized solution for quantifiable assessment of Parkinson’s Disease symptoms severity. By using wearable sensors, our framework can predict exact symptom values to assess Parkinson’s Disease severity. We propose a deep learning approach that utilizes Ground Reaction Force sensors. From sensor signals, features are extracted and fed to a hybrid deep learning model. This model is the combination of Convolutional Neural Networks and Locally Weighted Random Forest. Results: Proposed framework achieved 0.897, 3.009, 4.556 in terms of Correlation Coefficient, Mean Absolute Error and Root Mean Square Error, respectively. Proposed framework outperformed other machine and deep learning models. We also evaluated classification performance for disease detection. We outperformed most of the previous studies, achieving 99.5% accuracy, 98.7% sensitivity and 99.1% specificity. Conclusion: This is the first study to use a deep learning regression approach to predict exact symptom value of Parkinson’s Disease patients. Results show that this approach can be effectively employed as a disease severity assessment tool using wearable sensors.

N2  - Development of predictive computational models of metabolism through mechanistic models is complex and resource demanding, and their personalization remains challenging. Data-driven models of human metabolism would constitute a reliable, fast, and continuously updating model for predictive analytics. Wearable devices, such as smart bands and impedance balances, allow the real time and remote monitoring of physiological parameters, providing for a flux of data carrying information on user metabolism. Here, we developed a data-driven model of end-user metabolism, the Personalized Metabolic Avatar (PMA), to estimate its personalized reactions to diets. PMA consists of a gated recurrent unit (GRU) deep learning model trained to forecast personalized weight variations according to macronutrient composition and daily energy balance. The model can perform simulations and evaluation of diet plans, allowing the definition of tailored goals for achieving ideal weight. This approach can provide the correct clues to empower citizens with scientific knowledge, augmenting their self-awareness with the aim to achieve long-lasting results in pursuing a healthy lifestyle.

N2  - Wearable technology is an emerging method for the early detection of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. This scoping review explored the types, mechanisms, and accuracy of wearable technology for the early detection of COVID-19. This review was conducted according to the five-step framework of Arksey and O'Malley. Studies published between December 31, 2019 and December 15, 2021 were obtained from 10 electronic databases, namely, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ProQuest, Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and Taylor & Francis Online. Grey literature, reference lists, and key journals were also searched. All types of articles describing wearable technology for the detection of COVID-19 infection were included. Two reviewers independently screened the articles against the eligibility criteria and extracted the data using a data charting form. A total of 40 articles were included in this review. There are 22 different types of wearable technology used to detect COVID-19 infections early in the existing literature and are categorized as smartwatches or fitness trackers (67%), medical devices (27%), or others (6%). Based on deviations in physiological characteristics, anomaly detection models that can detect COVID-19 infection early were built using artificial intelligence or statistical analysis techniques. Reported area-under-the-curve values ranged from 75% to 94.4%, and sensitivity and specificity values ranged from 36.5% to 100% and 73% to 95.3%, respectively. Further research is necessary to validate the effectiveness and clinical dependability of wearable technology before healthcare policymakers can mandate its use for remote surveillance.

N2  - Urinalysis is attractive in non-invasive early diagnosis of bladder cancer compared with clinical gold standard cystoscopy. However, the trace bladder tumor biomarkers in urine and the particularly complex urine environment pose significant challenges for urinalysis. Here, a clinically adoptable urinalysis device that integrates molecular-specificity indium gallium zinc oxide field-effect transistor (IGZO FET) biosensor arrays, a device control panel, and an internet terminal for directly analyzing five bladder-tumor-associated proteins in clinical urine samples, is reported for bladder cancer diagnosis and classification. The IGZO FET biosensors with engineered sensing interfaces provide high sensitivity and selectivity for identification of trace proteins in the complex urine environment. Integrating with a machine-learning algorithm, this device can identify bladder cancer with an accuracy of 95.0% in a cohort of 197 patients and 75 non-bladder cancer individuals, distinguishing cancer stages with an overall accuracy of 90.0% and assessing bladder cancer recurrence after surgical treatment. The non-invasive urinalysis device defines a robust technology for remote healthcare and personalized medicine.

N2  - Stair climb power (SCP) is a clinical measure of leg muscular function assessed in-clinic via the Stair Climb Power Test (SCPT). This method is subject to human error and cannot provide continuous remote monitoring. Continuous monitoring using wearable sensors may provide a more comprehensive assessment of lower-limb muscular function. In this work, we propose an algorithm to classify stair climbing periods and estimate SCP from a lower-back worn accelerometer, which strongly agrees with the clinical standard (r = 0.92, p &lt; 0.001; ICC = 0.90, [0.82, 0.94]). Data were collected in-lab from healthy adults (n = 65) performing the four-step SCPT and a walking assessment while instrumented (accelerometer + gyroscope), which allowed us to investigate tradeoffs between sensor modalities. Using two classifiers, we were able to identify periods of stair ascent with &gt;89% accuracy [sensitivity = &gt;0.89, specificity = &gt;0.90] using two ensemble machine learning algorithms, trained on accelerometer signal features. Minimal changes in model performances were observed using the gyroscope alone (±0-6% accuracy) versus the accelerometer model. While we observed a slight increase in accuracy when combining gyroscope and accelerometer (about +3-6% accuracy), this is tolerable to preserve battery life in the at-home environment. This work is impactful as it shows potential for an accelerometer-based at-home assessment of SCP.

N2  - Introduction: The need to collect big data and to establish enduring patient outcomes, along with advances in technology and wearables has led to the ability and introduction of remote monitoring in Spinal Cord Stimulation systems (SCS). Objectives of Session: Dr Deer will discuss and highlight several factors involved with remote monitoring and the more advanced ability to remotely prescribe and change therapy in chronic pain patients with both DRG and SCS devices. We will examine how remote programming may enhance device durability and reduce explants and loss of therapy. This will lead to a discussion of the impact on payor coverage and societal financial impact. In addition, we will discuss the collective effort needed to effectively use remote monitoring. This includes action by the health care provider including the need with monitor with the intention of intervening to enhance care. This also includes billing based on medical necessity and supporting research and outcomes assessment to verify the need for this technology. This collective effort also includes effort needed by industry including to give support to enhance outcomes in both the established and de novo patient. Conclusion: Remote monitoring and programming may lead to new ideas of outcomes and data tracking and potentially lead to better long-term efficacy of patients with Neuromodulation devices. The responsible application of these technologies, and the combination with personal tracking devices may lead to a new evolution of artificial intelligence and individualized care.

N2  - Objective: To validate an automatic classification system for the identification of errors in the performance of standardized MDS-UPDRS III exercises by using inertial sensors from smartwatches (SW) and machine learning classifiers. Background: To improve current methods of diagnosis and objective monitoring of PD symptoms, wearable devices, and machine learning techniques have been used to develop solutions that enable remote monitoring [1]. One of the requirements to optimize monitoring is to ensure the quality of the data collected on ambulatory and remote settings, without the need for continuous supervision. Methods: Six subjects with PD participating in the TECAPARK project were recruited [2]. These participants wore a consumer smartwatch on the wrist of their most symptom-affected side. Data were captured weekly (eight weeks) during the performance of a set of eight standardized exercises selected from the MDS-UPDRS scale part 3. The automatic verification system was developed by using inertial signals of the SW treated with digital signal processing techniques and machine learning algorithms. The data were labeled by a clinical expert by observing video recordings made during the trials. Results: The highest accuracy in the error identification was obtained using the K-Nearest Neighbours classifier (KNN) trained with both triaxial gyroscope and triaxial accelerometer signals. The combination of feature extraction and principal component analysis (PCA) applied to each sensor independently achieved an accuracy of 89.4% (precision 89.6%; recall 72.9%; F-1 0.804) in the automatic verification of the execution of the exercises. Thus, the system can automatically identify, with high accuracy, the correct or wrong performance of the exercises without the supervision of a clinician or a caregiver. Conclusions: The implementation of a KNN classifier enables the automatic identification of the correct performance of MDS-UPDSRS exercises. Verification modules like these could be integrated into intelligent data collection systems that operate in a user-guided manner. Also, these kinds of solutions combined with tremor detection systems [3], bradykinesia, FOG can be used to perform autonomous data collection useful for continuous and remote monitoring of motor symptoms, improving the knowledge of the disease, and facilitating the development of better treatments for PD.

N2  - Background: Over decades, efforts to shave off life-saving minutes from ST-Elevated Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) care centred on reducing doorto- needle and door-to-balloon times. We firmly believe that symptom-toballoon time should prove a better focus to this end. Challenges come with this goal as it heavily relies on a patient's perception and initiative to seek care, which we deem intelligent and wearable Artificial Intelligence (AI)- driven Single Lead EKG technologies as an attractive solution in modernday cardiology. Purpose: To provide an accurate, accessible, and cost-effective AI-driven Single Lead STEMI detection algorithm that can be embedded into wearable devices and employed in a self-administered fashion. Methods: Database: EKG records from Mexico, Colombia, Argentina, and Brazil from April 2014 to December 2019. Dataset: A total of 11,567 12- lead EKG records of 10[s] length with a sampling frequency of 500 Hz, including the following balanced classes: Angiographically confirmed and unconfirmed STEMI, branch blocks, non-specific ST-T abnormalities, normal and abnormal (200+ CPT codes, excluding those mentioned above). Cardiologists manually checked the label of each record to ensure precision. Pre-processing: We discard the first and last 250 samples as they may contain a standardisation pulse. The study applied a digital low pass filter of order 5 with a frequency cut-off of 35 Hz. The mean was subtracted from each Lead. Classification: The determined classes were STEMI (Including STEMI in different locations of the myocardium - anterior, inferior, and lateral); and Not-STEMI (Combination of randomly sample, branch blocks, non-specific ST-T changes, and abnormal records - 25% of each). Training and Testing: A 1-D Convolutional Neural Network was trained and tested with a dataset proportion of 90/10, respectively. A different model was trained and tested for each Lead, using the central 4,500 samples of the records. The last dense layer outputs a probability for each report of being STEMI or Not-STEMI. Lead V2 showed the best overall results. The model was further tested through the same methodology using the best Lead with a subset of the previous data, excluding the unconfirmed STEMI EKG records (Total 7,230 12-lead EKG records for Confirmed Only STEMI dataset). Performance metrics were reported for each experiment and compared. Results: Combined STEMI data: Accuracy: 91.2%; Sensitivity: 89.6%; Specificity: 92.9%. Confirmed STEMI Only dataset: Accuracy: 92.4%; Sensitivity: 93.4%; Specificity: 91.4% (Figure 1). Conclusion: By assiduously improving the quality of the model's input, we continue to assess our algorithm's performance and reliability for future clinical validation as a potential remote monitoring and early STEMI detection device.

T1  - Cadence Detection in Road Cycling Using Saddle Tube Motion and Machine Learning
LA  - English
KW  - cycling
KW  - machine learning
KW  - motion
N2  - Most commercial cadence-measurement systems in road cycling are strictly limited in their function to the measurement of cadence. Other relevant signals, such as roll angle, inclination or a round kick evaluation, cannot be measured with them. This work proposes an alternative cadence-measurement system with less of the mentioned restrictions, without the need for distinct cadence-measurement apparatus attached to the pedal and shaft of the road bicycle. The proposed design applies an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to the seating pole of the bike. In an experiment, the motion data were gathered. A total of four different road cyclists participated in this study to collect different datasets for neural network training and evaluation. In total, over 10 h of road cycling data were recorded and used to train the neural network. The network's aim was to detect each revolution of the crank within the data. The evaluation of the data has shown that using pure accelerometer data from all three axes led to the best result in combination with the proposed network architecture. A working proof of concept was achieved with an accuracy of approximately 95% on test data. As the proof of concept can also be seen as a new method for measuring cadence, the method was compared with the ground truth. Comparing the ground truth and the predicted cadence, it can be stated that for the relevant range of 50 rpm and above, the prediction over-predicts the cadence with approximately 0.9 rpm with a standard deviation of 2.05 rpm. The results indicate that the proposed design is fully functioning and can be seen as an alternative method to detect the cadence of a road cyclist.

N2  - Skin-inspired flexible wearable acceleration sensors attract much attention due to their advantages of portability, personalized and comfortable experience, and potential application in healthcare monitoring, human–machine interfaces, artificial intelligence, and physical sports performance evaluation. This paper presents a flexible wearable acceleration sensor for monitoring human motion by introducing the island–bridge configuration and serpentine interconnects. Compared with traditional wearable accelerometers, the flexible accelerometer proposed in this paper improves the wearing comfort while reducing the cost of the device. Simulation and experiments under bending, stretching, and torsion conditions demonstrate that the flexible performance of the flexible acceleration sensor can meet the needs of monitoring the daily movement of the human body, and it can work normally under various conditions. The measurement accuracy of the flexible acceleration sensor is verified by comparing it with the data of the commercial acceleration sensor. The flexible acceleration sensor can measure the acceleration and the angular velocity of the human body with six degrees of freedom and recognize the gesture and motion features according to the acceleration characteristics. The presented flexible accelerometers provide great potential in recognizing the motion features that are critical for healthcare monitoring and physical sports performance evaluation.

N2  - Telemonitoring provides a set of technologies that enables remote monitoring of patients with critical health conditions.Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN) technology has emerged as a major factor contributor to the need for ubiquitous healthcare.It provides a real-time telemonitoring system to treat several chronic diseases using wireless biosensors.The first standard to support communication between biosensors is IEEE 802.15 Task Groups 6 (TG6). The standard regulates the communication in,on or inside the human body for a short-range and low power wireless communications.IEEE 802.15.6 operates on a Medium Access Control (MAC) layer that supports several Physical (PHY) layers such as narrowband (NB),ultra-wideband (UWB),and human body communication (HBC).In this paper,a realtime telemonitoring system architecture for EEG brainwave emotion recognition is presented.The system aims to collect EEG data and forward them to clinicians in order to detect the evolution of the monitored diseases based on brain wave emotion analysis.Ensemble Learning techniques are used for decision making to discern the current health state of the patient.

KW  - machine learning

N2  - Human Activity Recognition (HAR) that includes gait analysis may be useful for various rehabilitation and telemonitoring applications. Current gait analysis methods, such as wearables or cameras, have privacy and operational constraints, especially when used with older adults. Millimeter-Wave (MMW) radar is a promising solution for gait applications because of its low-cost, better privacy, and resilience to ambient light and climate conditions. This paper presents a novel human gait analysis method that combines the micro-Doppler spectrogram and skeletal pose estimation using MMW radar for HAR. In our approach, we used the Texas Instruments IWR6843ISK-ODS MMW radar to obtain the micro-Doppler spectrogram and point clouds for 19 human joints. We developed a multilayer Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize and classify five different gait patterns with an accuracy of 95.7 to 98.8% using MMW radar data. During training of the CNN algorithm, we used the extracted 3D coordinates of 25 joints using the Kinect V2 sensor and compared them with the point clouds data to improve the estimation. Finally, we performed a real-time simulation to observe the point cloud behavior for different activities and validated our system against the ground truth values. The proposed method demonstrates the ability to distinguish between different human activities to obtain clinically relevant gait information.

N2  - The hydrogel-based epidermal sensors have attracted tremendous attention due to their versatile potential applications in soft robotics, personal healthcare monitoring, and electronic skins. However, it remains a critical challenge for hydrogel-based sensors to simultaneously achieve self-healing capability and adhesiveness for full-scale human motion biomonitoring. Herein, we proposed a multifunctional MXene/polyampholytes nanocomposite hydrogel. The main network of this hydrogel was formed by the one-step radical polymerization of cationic monomer and anionic monomer. The simultaneous strong and weak ionic bonds-based crosslinking inside this hydrogel endowed it outstanding stretchable, tough, self-healing, adhesive properties, while the introduction of MXene further guaranteed the excellent mechanical properties and conductivity of this hydrogel. Our further exploration of this MXene/polyampholytes in the application as wearable epidermal sensor strongly proved its durable accuracy and sensitivity for the detection of human motions. This epidermal sensor also could be assembled to the detector of the daily activity monitor of Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) patients, which could be utilized to aid the ADHD treatment by remindering the patients to pay attention to their actions. Our work shed a new light on the development of eco-friendly wearable sensor for the personalized healthcare monitoring, human–machine interfaces, and artificial intelligence.

N2  - Undiagnosed malnutrition is a significant problem in high-income countries, which can reduce the quality of life of many individuals, particularly of older adults. Moreover, it can also inflate the costs of existing health care systems because of the many metabolic complications that it can cause. The current methods for assessing malnutrition can be cumbersome. A trained practitioner must be present to conduct an assessment, or patients must travel to facilities with specialized equipment to obtain their measurements. Therefore, digital health care is a possible way of closing this gap as it is rapidly gaining traction as a scalable means of improving efficiency in the health care system. It allows for the remote monitoring of nutritional status without requiring the physical presence of practitioners or the use of advanced medical equipment. As such, there is an increasing interest in expanding the range of digital applications to facilitate remote monitoring and management of health issues. In this study, we discuss the feasibility of a novel digital remote method for diagnosing malnutrition using facial morphometrics. Many malnutrition screening assessments include subjective assessments of the head and the face. Facial appearance is often used by clinicians as the first point of qualitative indication of health status. Hence, there may be merit in quantifying these subtle but observable changes using facial morphometrics. Modern advancements in artificial intelligence, data science, sensors, and computing technologies allow facial features to be accurately digitized, which could potentially allow these previously intuitive assessments to be quantified. This study aims to stimulate further discussion and discourse on how this emerging technology can be used to provide real-time access to nutritional status. The use of facial morphometrics extends the use of currently available technology and may provide a scalable, easily deployable solution for nutritional status to be monitored in real time. This will enable clinicians and dietitians to keep track of patients remotely and provide the necessary intervention measures as required, as well as providing health care institutions and policy makers with essential information that can be used to inform and enable targeted public health approaches within affected populations.

N2  - A soft bending sensor based on the inverse pyramid structure is demonstrated, revealing that it can effectively suppress microcrack formation in designated regions, thus allowing the cracks to open gradually with bending in a controlled manner. Such a feature enabled the bending sensor to simultaneously have a wide dynamic range of bending strain (0.025-5.4%), high gauge factor (∼74), and high linearity (R2 ∼ 0.99). Furthermore, the bending sensor can capture repeated instantaneous changes in strain and various types of vibrations, owing to its fast response time. Moreover, the bending direction can be differentiated with a single layer of the sensor, and using an array of sensors integrated on a glove, object recognition was demonstrated via machine learning. Finally, a self-monitoring proprioceptive ionic electroactive polymer (IEAP) actuator capable of operating in liquid was demonstrated. Such features of our bending sensor will enable a simple and effective way of detecting sophisticated motion, thus potentially advancing wearable healthcare monitoring electronics and enabling proprioceptive soft robotics.

N2  - Background: Although there is interest in wearables and smartphone technologies for remote outcome monitoring, little is known regarding the willingness of hip osteoarthritis (OA) and/or total hip arthroplasty (THA) patients to authorize and adhere to such treatment. Methods: We developed an Institutional Review Board–approved questionnaire to evaluate patient perceptions of remote monitoring technologies in a high-volume orthopedic center. Forty-seven THA patients (60% female; mean age: 66 years) and 50 nonoperative OA hip patients (52% female; mean age: 63 years) participated. Patient perceptions were compared using Pearson's chi-squared analyses. Results: THA patients were similarly interested in the use of smartphone apps (91% vs 94%, P =.695) in comparison to nonoperative hip OA patients. THA patients were more receptive to using wearable sensors (94% vs 44%, P <.001) relative to their nonoperative counterparts. THA patients also expressed stronger interest in learning to use custom wearables (87% vs 32%, P <.001) vs nonoperative patients. Likewise, the majority of THA patients were willing to use Global Positioning System technology (74% vs 26%, P <.001). THA patients also expressed willingness to have their body movement (89%), balance (89%), sleep (87%), and cardiac output (91%) tracked using remote technology. Conclusion: Overall, we found that THA patients were highly receptive to using wearable technology in their treatments. Nonoperative OA hip patients were generally unreceptive to using smart technologies, with the exception of smartphone applications. This information may be useful as utilization of these technologies for patient care continues to evolve.

N2  - High quality and efficient medical service is one of the major factors defining living standards. Developed countries strive to make their healthcare systems as efficient and cost-effective as possible. Remote medical services are a promising approach to lower medical costs and, at the same time, accelerating diagnosis and treatment of diseases. Internet of things (IoT) has the power to connect several devices, users, databases, etc., in a unified manner. Internet of medical things (IoMT) is some type of IoT designed to facilitate medical services. Using IoMT, many of the medical tasks, such as chronic disease monitoring, disease diagnosis, etc., can be realized remotely, leading to lower healthcare costs and better services. This paper is devoted to the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in recent advances on IoMT. Hardware requirements and recent articles proposing solutions for IoMT using AI are reviewed. A comprehensive list of major benefits and challenges is presented as well. Wearable medical devices (WMDs) are also investigated. The WMDs classification is also performed based on their technology. Market share and its anticipated growth for different types of WMDs are also analyzed for the first time. Moreover, common applications of AI in IoMT are reviewed and then classified based on their usage. The paper is closed with the conclusion and possible directions for future works.

N2  - Introduction Current international guidelines recommend ECG monitoring after an ischaemic stroke to detect atrial fibrillation (AF) in order to prevent stroke recurrence. However, optimal strategies to detect AF and the downstream management to prevent stroke recurrence remain to be established. The objective of the study was to explore the use of long-term home-based ECG monitoring for AF detection and stroke prevention in patients with a history of stroke. Methods and analysis This prospective, randomised, open-label trial with blinded endpoint adjudication aimed to evaluate the efficacy of long-term home-based ECG monitoring for AF detection and stroke prevention in a 24-month period. Patients aged >18 years with a history of ischaemic stroke will be stratified according to the time from the index ischaemic stroke: <1, 1-3 and >3 years and then randomised in 1:1 to (1) home-based AF screening and (2) control. The home-based AF screening system comprises (1) a handheld single-lead ECG recorder (Comfit Healthcare Devices, Hong Kong SAR, China) and (2) a patient-facing smartphone application specially designed for the study. Patients randomised to the home-based AF group will record a 30 s single-lead ECG using a specially designed handheld ECG device every morning or when symptomatic. All remotely obtained data will be automatically transmitted in real-time through the study smartphone application to a secured cloud hosting and analysed using an artificial intelligence-based diagnostic system. When a diagnosis of AF is made with the system, the patients will be called back for a formal cardiology consultation within 1 week. The primary endpoint is the time to first detection of AF at 24 months of follow-up. Secondary endpoints include recurrent stroke or transient ischaemic attack, initiation of long-term anticoagulation therapy, hospitalisation for heart failure, cardiovascular death and all-cause death. Ethics and dissemination The study protocol has been approved by the institutional review board of The University of Hong Kong, and Hong Kong West Cluster, Hospital Authority, Hong Kong SAR, China. Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals. Trial registration number NCT04523649.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized health care delivery in recent years. There is an increase in research for advanced AI techniques, such as deep learning, to build predictive models for the early detection of diseases. Such predictive models leverage mobile health (mHealth) data from wearable sensors and smartphones to discover novel ways for detecting and managing chronic diseases and mental health conditions. OBJECTIVE: Currently, little is known about the use of AI-powered mHealth (AIM) settings. Therefore, this scoping review aims to map current research on the emerging use of AIM for managing diseases and promoting health. Our objective is to synthesize research in AIM models that have increasingly been used for health care delivery in the last 2 years. METHODS: Using Arksey and O'Malley's 5-point framework for conducting scoping reviews, we reviewed AIM literature from the past 2 years in the fields of biomedical technology, AI, and information systems. We searched 3 databases, PubsOnline at INFORMS, e-journal archive at MIS Quarterly, and Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Digital Library using keywords such as "mobile healthcare," "wearable medical sensors," "smartphones", and "AI." We included AIM articles and excluded technical articles focused only on AI models. We also used the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) technique for identifying articles that represent a comprehensive view of current research in the AIM domain. RESULTS: We screened 108 articles focusing on developing AIM models for ensuring better health care delivery, detecting diseases early, and diagnosing chronic health conditions, and 37 articles were eligible for inclusion, with 31 of the 37 articles being published last year (76%). Of the included articles, 9 studied AI models to detect serious mental health issues, such as depression and suicidal tendencies, and chronic health conditions, such as sleep apnea and diabetes. Several articles discussed the application of AIM models for remote patient monitoring and disease management. The considered primary health concerns belonged to 3 categories: mental health, physical health, and health promotion and wellness. Moreover, 14 of the 37 articles used AIM applications to research physical health, representing 38% of the total studies. Finally, 28 out of the 37 (76%) studies used proprietary data sets rather than public data sets. We found a lack of research in addressing chronic mental health issues and a lack of publicly available data sets for AIM research. CONCLUSIONS: The application of AIM models for disease detection and management is a growing research domain. These models provide accurate predictions for enabling preventive care on a broader scale in the health care domain. Given the ever-increasing need for remote disease management during the pandemic, recent AI techniques, such as federated learning and explainable AI, can act as a catalyst for increasing the adoption of AIM and enabling secure data sharing across the health care industry.

N2  - Novel means to minimize treatment delays in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) are needed. Using an accelerometer and gyroscope on the chest yield mechanocardiographic (MCG) data. We investigated whether STEMI causes changes in MCG signals which could help to detect STEMI. The study group consisted of 41 STEMI patients and 49 control patients referred for elective coronary angiography and having normal left ventricular function and no valvular heart disease or arrhythmia. MCG signals were recorded on the upper sternum in supine position upon arrival to the catheterization laboratory. In this study, we used a dedicated wearable sensor equipped with 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis gyroscope and 1-lead ECG in order to facilitate the detection of STEMI in a clinically meaningful way. A supervised machine learning approach was used. Stability of beat morphology, signal strength, maximum amplitude and its timing were calculated in six axes from each window with varying band-pass filters in 2-90 Hz range. In total, 613 features were investigated. Using logistic regression classifier and leave-one-person-out cross validation we obtained a sensitivity of 73.9%, specificity of 85.7% and AUC of 0.857 (SD = 0.005) using 150 best features. As a result, mechanical signals recorded on the upper chest wall with the accelerometers and gyroscopes differ significantly between STEMI patients and stable patients with normal left ventricular function. Future research will show whether MCG can be used for the early screening of STEMI.

N2  - Current developments in sensors and actuators are heralding a new era to facilitate things to happen effortlessly and efficiently with proper communication. On the other hand, Internet of Things (IoT) has been boomed up with er potential and occupies a wide range of disciplines. This study has choreographed to design of an algorithm and a smart data-processing scheme to implement the obtained data from the sensing system to transmit to the receivers. Technically, it is called “telediagnosis” and “remote digital monitoring,” a revolution in the field of medicine and artificial intelligence. For the proof of concept, an algorithmic approach has been implemented for telediagnosis with one of the degenerative diseases, that is, Parkinson's disease. Using the data acquired from an improved interdigitated electrode, sensing surface was evaluated with the attained sensitivity of 100 fM (n = 3), and the limit of detection was calculated with the linear regression value coefficient. By the designed algorithm and data processing with the assistance of IoT, further validation was performed and attested the coordination. This proven concept can be ideally used with all sensing strategies for immediate telemedicine by end-to-end communications.

N2  - Over the past few decades, technology and improvements in artificial intelligence have dramatically changed major sectors of our day-to-day lives, including the field of healthcare. E-health includes a wide range of subdomains, such as wearables, smart-inhalers, portable electronic spirometers, digital stethoscopes, and clinical decision support systems. E-health has been consistently shown to enhance the quality of care, improve adherence to therapy, and allow early detection of worsening in chronic pulmonary diseases. The present review addresses the current and potential future role of major e-health tools and approaches in respiratory medicine, with the aim of providing readers with trustful and updated evidence to increase their awareness of the topic, and to allow them to optimally benefit from the latest innovation technology. Collected literature evidence shows that the potential of technology tools in respiratory medicine mainly relies on three fundamental interactions: between clinicians, between clinician and patient, and between patient and health technology. However, it would be desirable to establish widely agreed and adopted standards for conducting trials and reporting results in this area, as well as to take into proper consideration potentially relevant pitfalls related to privacy protection and compliance with regulatory procedures.

N2  - Purpose of Review: In this article, we review a range of digital technologies for possible application in heart failure patients, with a focus on lessons learned. We also discuss a future model of heart failure management, as digital technologies continue to become part of standard care. Recent Findings: Digital technologies are increasingly used by healthcare professionals and those living with heart failure to support more personalised and timely shared decision-making, earlier identification of problems, and an improved experience of care. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the acceptability and implementation of a range of digital technologies, including remote monitoring and health tracking, mobile health (wearable technology and smartphone-based applications), and the use of machine learning to augment data interpretation and decision-making. Much has been learned over recent decades on the challenges and opportunities of technology development, including how best to evaluate the impact of digital health interventions on health and healthcare, the human factors involved in implementation and how best to integrate dataflows into the clinical pathway. Summary: Supporting patients with heart failure as well as healthcare professionals (both with a broad range of health and digital literacy skills) is crucial to success. Access to digital technologies and the internet remains a challenge for some patients. The aim should be to identify the right technology for the right patient at the right time, in a process of co-design and co-implementation with patients.

N2  - Flexible and wearable pressure sensors have gained great popularity in consumer electronics due to their potential applications in human healthcare, E-skin, and artificial intelligence interactions. MXene is regarded as one of the most ideal candidate sensing materials due to its high electrical conductivity and controllable interlayer space. However, the easy-to-oxidize characteristic of MXene materials greatly restricts the sensitivity and reliability of sensor devices, especially in wet climates. Herein, a highly sensitive and waterproof flexible pressure sensor using a free-standing hydrophobic bacterial cellulose/Ti3C2Tx MXene (HBT) hybrid film as a sensing layer is fabricated by facile and effective nanocellulose intercalation and fluorine modification strategies. The obtained pressure sensor delivers high sensitivity (65.5 kPa-1), fast response (50 ms), wide linear sensing range (0.002-30 kPa) with a low detection limit of 0.57 Pa, and excellent repeatability over 50,000 cycles. Meanwhile, owing to the highly hydrophobic surface of the HTB film, the outstanding sensing features could be well retained, although immersed in water several times. Benefiting from the excellent sensing properties and water resistance, the HBT sensor serves as a wearable force sensor to monitor the full-range human physiological motions regardless of whether the conditions are normal or wet. This work provides a new pathway to design the MXene pressure sensor with high reliability and demonstrates the promising usage of HBT sensors in portable biomedical electronics.

N2  - COVID-19 is a life-threatening contagious virus that has spread across the globe rapidly. To reduce the outbreak impact of COVID-19 virus illness, continual identification and remote surveillance of patients are essential. Medical service delivery based on the Internet of Things (IoT) technology backed up by the fog-cloud paradigm is an efficient and time-sensitive solution for remote patient surveillance. Conspicuously, a comprehensive framework based on Radio Frequency Identification Device (RFID) and body-wearable sensor technologies supported by the fog-cloud platform is proposed for the identification and management of COVID-19 patients. The J48 decision tree is used to assess the infection degree of the user based on corresponding symptoms. RFID is used to detect Temporal Proximity Interactions (TPI) among users. Using TPI quantification, Temporal Network Analysis is used to analyze and track the current stage of the COVID-19 spread. The statistical performance and accuracy of the framework are assessed by utilizing synthetically-generated data for 250,000 users. Based on the comparative analysis, the proposed framework acquired an enhanced measure of classification accuracy, and sensitivity of 96.68% and 94.65% respectively. Moreover, significant improvement has been registered for proposed fog-cloud-based data analysis in terms of Temporal Delay efficacy, Precision, and F-measure.

N2  - Background: Relapses and recurrences contribute to the significant morbidity and mortality in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Recent advances in mobile technologies and wearable sensors have enabled continuous remote monitoring of patients with MDD. Here we discuss the replication results of personalized (N of 1) relapse prediction framework using actigraphy data and self-reported symptoms to predict relapse and recurrence in MDD. Methods: The personalized (N of 1) relapse prediction framework encompasses a LSTM based Anomaly Detection using fractal and entropy activity features. Once anomaly was predicted in a patient’s activity data, the risk of relapse was confirmed by a pre-specified rule-based algorithm of self-reported questions (VQIDS-5, GAD-7). This personalized framework was developed and evaluated in an observation trial ORBIT (NCT02489305, N=211) followed by confirmation in an independent trial Wellness (NCT02934334, N=46) in MDD patients with longitudinal data collection (≥1 year) of self-reported assessments, continuous activity monitoring and regular bimonthly clinic visits with MADRS based relapse assessment. Results: The personalized framework achieved a balanced accuracy (BAC) of 0.74 with a median time of detection (TOD) of 21 days in ORBIT across 1190 clinic visits and achieved a comparable performance with a BAC of 0.71 and a median TOD of 14 days in Wellness across 148 clinic visits. Conclusions: The predictive ability of a personalized (N of 1) relapse prediction framework was demonstrated in an observational MDD study confirmed by the replication trial. The proposed framework predicted majority of relapses and recurrences with low provider, patient burden with considerable lead-in time for possible relapse and recurrence preemption. Supported By: The ORBIT study (NCT02489305) was funded by Janssen Research and Development, LLC. The Wellness study (NCT02934334) was carried out in collaboration with the Canadian Biomarker Integration Network for Depression (CAN-BIND), with funding support from the Ontario Brain Institute, the Ontario Research Fund – Research Excellence Program and Janssen Research and Development, LLC.

N2  - Digital technologies permeate all areas of our daily life. Activity and sleep trackers are used for monitoring and applications on smartphones for communication in the healthy population and in cancer research. In particular, the corona-pandemic have spur growth in the use and implementation of digital technologies. This session aims to give an overview on selected publications, outlook, and discussion of aspects of the use or wearables in cancer care. Wearables are investigated during outpatient or inpatient treatment. Wearables and smartphone applications and are investigated to prevent emergency re-hospitalizations or to strengthen outpatient or home care. The combination of subjective actively patient reported outcomes measures and objective passively sensed digital biomarkers is considered as a promising approach. Information flow and data storage are discussed. Bots and Artificial Intelligence could help to better treat patients and prevent emergencies. These strengths and opportunities contrast with threats such as privacy/ surveillance issues and rationing and de-humanization. A guideline by the WHO on how to implement digital interventions will be discussed. Approaches in favor of patient care are warranted in this fast moving field or research.

N2  - Background: Although many electrocardiography wearable devices have been released recently for the detection of atrial fibrillation (AF), there are few studies reporting prospective data for wearable devices compared to the strategy of the existing guidelines in the detection of atrial fibrillation (AF) after cryptogenic stroke. A tiny single-patch monitor is more convenient than a conventional Holter monitor recording device and, therefore, longer duration of monitoring may be acceptable. Methods and Design: The CANDLE-AF study is a multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled trial. Patients with transient ischemic attack or ischemic stroke without any history of AF will be enrolled. The superiority of the 72-h single-patch monitor to standard strategy and non-inferiority of the 72-h single-patch monitor to an event-recorder-type device will be investigated. Single-patch monitor arm will repeat monitoring at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, event-recorder-type arm will repeat monitoring twice daily for 12 months. The enrollment goal is a total of 600 patients, and the primary outcome is the detection of AF which continues at least 30 s during study period. The secondary outcome is the rate of changes from antiplatelet to anticoagulant and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events within 1 year. Conclusions: The results of CANDLE-AF will clarify the role of a single-lead patch ECG for the early detection of AF in patients with acute ischemic stroke. In addition, the secondary outcome will be analyzed to determine whether more sensitive AF detection can affect the prognosis and if further device development is meaningful.

N2  - Objective: Ambulatory monitoring of ground reaction force (GRF) and center of pressure (CoP) could improve management of health conditions that impair mobility. Insoles instrumented with force-sensitive resistors (FSRs) are an unobtrusive, low-cost, and low-power technology for sampling GRF and CoP in real-world environments. However, FSRs have variable response characteristics that complicate estimation of GRF and CoP. This study introduces a unique data analytic pipeline that enables accurate estimation of GRF and CoP despite relatively inaccurate FSR responses. This paper also investigates whether inclusion of a complementary knee angle sensor improves estimation accuracy. Methods: Seventeen healthy subjects were equipped with an insole instrumented with six FSRs and a string-based knee angle sensor. Subjects walked in a straight line at self-selected slow, preferred, and fast speeds over an in-ground force platform. Twenty repetitions were performed for each speed. Supervised machine learning models estimated weight-normalized GRF and shoe size-normalized CoP, which were re-scaled to obtain GRF and CoP. Results: Anteroposterior GRF, Vertical GRF, and Anteroposterior CoP were estimated with a normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of less than 5%. Mediolateral GRF and CoP were estimated with an NRMSE of 8.1% and 6.4%, respectively. Knee angle-related features slightly improved GRF estimates. Conclusion: Normalized models accurately estimated GRF and CoP despite deficiencies in FSR data. Significance: Ambulatory use of the proposed system could enable objective, longitudinal monitoring of severity and progression for a variety of health conditions.

N2  - Background: Technologies applied to health have become an increasingly present discussion among the modalities of therapeutic, diagnostic, and monitoring interventions in the health area. The health and functional capacity are a prerequisite for active elderly, which emphasizes the intermediary role of technology in quality of life. We implemented a technological strategy, based on Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), for health services. Developing a remote monitoring system for the elderly, which captures patient information 24 hours a day through wearable devices. Currently it is possible for Senior Mobile Health professionals to provide continuous evaluation about elderly health, offering crucial data for the prediction of adverse health conditions through smart algorithms. Therefore, the main goal of this study was to show the development of remote monitoring system and its functionally. The system consists in a web dashboard to store and view the information about the health indicators, mobile app to facility the data collect by the health professionals during the intervention and smart algorithms developed from the sensors. Methods: The Senior Mobile Health (SMH) platform has a microservice architecture, with several services connected to user and information management, data science and IoT. Most of the artificial intelligence algorithms work with time series analysis and machine learning to monitor important data on the health of the elderly. Using sensors as accelerometer, gyroscope, global position system (GPS) and the photoplethysmography sensor, we developed smart algorithms to follow the health indicators such as heart rate variability, nocturia, gait speed and others. The mobile app is designed to encourage elderly in their self-care through specific goals and activities. Results: By using wearable devices, mobile application and web dashboard, the smart algorithms of the SMH platform predict adverse health outcomes and promote real-time and continuous monitoring of the elderly health. Such algorithms are currently analyzing, for example, heart rate variability, steps, nocturia, quality of sleep and gait speed, which are closely linked to adverse outcomes in the health of the elderly. These functionalities are important in human aging process. The SMH platform receives heart rate data from the wearable devices and transform the data in information about Heart Rate Variability (HRV). The HRV reflects the oscillations in the interval between consecutive heartbeats that result mainly from the dynamic interaction between the parasympathetic and the sympathetic system. The changes in HRV patterns provide information about the decline in health, mainly the cognitive functioning. Step counting sensors, as accelerometers, can be able to daily monitor the activity level and the number of steps each day. They can be used also as a strategy to motivate the elderly to remain active through established previously goals by the health professionals. Recent studies show how many steps a day are enough for specific populations as elderly to be considered as free of chronic disease and active, or as elderly with chronic disease and sedentary lifestyle. Thereby, using the SMH platform, patients are monitored, and specific profiles are created. The nocturia is a condition in which an individual has to wake up at night many times to urination, which each urination being preceded and followed by sleep. By using sensors as accelerometers and photoplethysmography to analyze the movements and steps at night, besides the heartbeats analysis with the smart algorithms, the SMH platform can be able to identify how many times the individual wake up at night and go to the bathroom. These conditions can be associate with serious illnesses such as prostate cancer, diabetes, and others. Sleep disturbances are common symptoms among the people. However, previous studies show that elderly become more vulnerable to sleep disorders than other individuals, showing a decreasing global sleep time at night, increasing sleep latency, with sleep-wake cycle disorders, especially excessive daytime sleepiness. The monitoring of sleep patterns and sleep quality can be useful to assess the sleep influences on outcomes that interfere in the elderly health. The gait speed has been used as another important metrics to monitor. Gait speed patterns change can be markers of various general medical conditions, including, cognitive decline, and increased chance of falls, hospitalizations, or even death. The high association between gait speed and clinical adverse outcome become this measure an important information and widely used. The platform proposal is to automatically obtain this information from devices, decreasing and facilitating the work of health professionals. This platform has been implemented in several places such as public and private Brazilian hospitals to monitoring the inpatients, an Elderly Community Center to following active older adults, a Condominium for Senior to create a digital environment and other. Conclusion: This paper presented the SMH platform, a system oriented to the elderly care. The platform is registered in the Brazilian National Institute of Intellectual Property, with the patent BR512020002492-0. Results show that the platform provides interesting features of elderly monitoring.

N2  - Background and Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic manifested the need of developing robust digital platforms for facilitating healthcare services such as consultancy, clinical therapies, real time remote monitoring, early diagnosis and future predictions. Innovations made using technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), edge computing, cloud computing and artificial intelligence are helping address this crisis. The urge for remote monitoring, symptom analysis and early detection of diseases lead to tremendous increase in the deployment of wearable sensor devices. They facilitate seamless gathering of physiological data such as electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, respiration traces (RESP), galvanic skin response (GSR), pulse rate, body temperature, photoplethysmograms (PPG), oxygen saturation (SpO2) etc. For diagnosis and analysis purpose, the gathered data needs to be stored. Wearable devices operate on batteries and have a memory constraint. In mHealth application architectures, this gathered data is hence stored on cloud based servers. While transmitting data from wearable devices to cloud servers via edge devices, a lot of energy is consumed. This paper proposes a deep learning based compression model SCAElite that reduces the data volume, enabling energy efficient transmission. Results: Stress Recognition in Automobile Drivers dataset and MIT-BIH dataset from PhysioNet are used for validation of algorithm performance. The model achieves a compression ratio of up to 300 fold with reconstruction errors within 8% over the stress recognition dataset and 106.34-fold with reconstruction errors within 8% over the MIT-BIH dataset. The computational complexity of SCAElite is 51.65% less compared to state-of-the-art deep compressive model. Conclusion: It is experimentally validated that SCAElite guarantees a high compression ratio with good quality restoration capabilities for physiological signal compression in mHealth applications. It has a compact architecture and is computationally more efficient compared to state-of-the-art deep compressive model.

N2  - Sweat-activated batteries (SABs) are lightweight, biocompatible energy generators that produce sufficient power for skin-interface electronic devices. However, the fabrication of 1D SABs that are compatible with conventional textile techniques for self-powered wearable electronics remains challenging. In this study, a cotton-yarn-based SAB (CYSAB) with a segmental structure is developed, in which carbon-black-modified, pristine yarn and Zn foil-wrapped segments are prepared to serve as the cathode, salt bridge, and anode, respectively. Upon electrolyte absorption, the CYSAB can be rapidly activated. Its performance is closely related to the ion concentration, infiltrated electrolyte volume, and evaporation rate. The CYSAB can tolerate repeated bending and washing without any significant influence on its power output. Moreover, the CYSABs can be woven into fabrics and connected in series and parallel configurations to produce an energy supplying headband, which can be activated by the sweat secreted from a volunteer during a cycling exercise to power light-emitting diode headlights. The developed CYSAB can also be integrated with yarn-based strain sensors to achieve a smart textile for the self-powered sensing of human motion and breathing. This weavable, washable, and scalable CYSAB is expected to contribute to the manufacturing of self-powered smart textiles for future applications in wearable healthcare monitoring.

N2  - Introduction: Falls are a common cause of injuries in people over 65 years, usually resulting in life-threatening or life-altering sequalae for affected individuals. Falls risk assessment typically requires a face-to-face evaluation delivered by a trained professional in a clinical setting, thus limiting their application for many older people with falls. Therefore, there is a need for a remote monitoring system (RMS) that captures mobility data to assess comprehensively an older individual's true falls risk undertaking their everyday activities in their usual environment. Methods: A pilot study was conducted with 16 participants over 65 years classified as high (n = 9) or low falls risk (n = 7) based on their fall's history. A RMS was developed, which combines inertial measurement unit (IMU) data from a wearable device and online realtime Machine Learning (ML) to generate a two-stage fall risk assessment. In stage one, a ML activity motion classifier identified raw IMU data from participants as either, walking, resting or transitional movements (turning or sitting to standing). In stage two, previously classifiedmotion segments were analysed by aML fall-risk classifier, providing an Objective risk assessment based on gait characteristics during everyday motion. Falls incidence was recorded prospectively at one year follow-up. Results: The motion classifier achieved an 94.8% accuracy in differentiating between resting, walking and transitional movements. The fall risk classifier initially trained with retrospective fall history data achieved an 87.5% accuracy with 88.9% sensitivity and specificity, which is comparable to other accurate classifiers in published literature. The fall risk classifier retrained with prospective one year follow-up data achieved a 73% accuracy which was superior to the 67% accuracy of the Timed Up and Go test for falls prediction. Conclusion: Our study shows the potential of a machine-learning remote monitoring system using information from mobility data to classify an older person's falls' risk.

N2  - Parkinson's disease is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that affects a large portion of the population, especially the elderly. It manifests with motor, cognitive and other types of symptoms, decreasing significantly the patients' quality of life. The recent advances in the Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence fields, including the subdomains of machine learning and deep learning, can support Parkinson's disease patients, their caregivers and clinicians at every stage of the disease, maximizing the treatment effectiveness and minimizing the respective healthcare costs at the same time. In this review, the considered studies propose machine learning models, trained on data acquired via smart devices, wearable or non-wearable sensors and other Internet of Things technologies, to provide predictions or estimations regarding Parkinson's disease aspects. Seven hundred and seventy studies have been retrieved from three dominant academic literature databases. Finally, one hundred and twelve of them have been selected in a systematic way and have been considered in the state-of-the-art systematic review presented in this paper. These studies propose various methods, applied on various sensory data to address different Parkinson's disease-related problems. The most widely deployed sensors, the most commonly addressed problems and the best performing algorithms are highlighted. Finally, some challenges are summarized along with some future considerations and opportunities that arise.

N2  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven adaptive techniques are viable to optimize the resources in the Internet of Things (IoT) enabled wearable healthcare devices. Due to the miniature size and ability of wireless data transfer, Body Sensor Networks (BSNs) have become the center of attention in current medical media technologies. For a long-term and reliable healthcare system, high energy efficiency, transmission reliability, and longer battery lifetime of wearable sensors devices are required. There is a dire need for empowering sensor-based wearable techniques in BSNs from every aspect i.e., data collection, healthcare monitoring, and diagnosis. The consideration of protocol layers, data routing, and energy optimization strategies improves the efficiency of healthcare delivery. Hence, this work presents some key contributions. Firstly, it proposes a novel avant-garde framework to simultaneously optimize the energy efficiency, battery lifetime, and reliability for smart and connected healthcare. Secondly, in this study, an Adaptive Transmission Data Rate (ATDR) mechanism is proposed, which works on the average constant energy consumption by varying the active time of the sensor node to optimize the energy over the dynamic wireless channel. Moreover, a Self-Adaptive Routing Algorithm (SARA) is developed to adopt a dynamic source routing mechanism with an energy-efficient and shortest possible path, unlike the conventional routing methods. Lastly, real-time datasets are adopted for intensive experimental setup for revealing pervasive and cost-effective healthcare through wearable devices. It is observed and analysed that proposed algorithms outperform in terms of high energy efficiency, better reliability, and longer battery lifetime of portable devices.

N2  - In order to reduce the burden on healthcare systems and in particular to support an appropriate way to the Emergency Department (ED) access, home tele-monitoring patients was strongly recommended during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, paper from numerous groups has shown the potential of using data from wearable devices to characterize each individual's unique baseline, identify deviations from that baseline suggestive of a viral infection, and to aggregate that data to better inform population surveillance trends. However, no evidence about usage of Artificial Intelligence (AI) applicatives on digitally data collected from patients and doctors exists. With a growing global population of connected wearable users, this could potentially help to improve the earlier diagnosis and management of infectious individuals and improving timeliness and precision of tracking infectious disease outbreaks. During the study RICOVAI-19 (RICOVero ospedaliero con strumenti di Artificial Intelligence nei pazienti con COVid-19) performed in the Marche Region, Italy, we evaluated 129 subjects monitored at home in a six-months period between March 22, 2021 and October 22, 2021. During the monitoring, personal on demand health technologies were used to collect clinical and vital data in order to feed the database and the machine learning engine. The AI output resulted in a clinical stability index (CSI) which enables the system to deliver suggestions to the population and doctors about how intervene. Results showed the beneficial influence of CSI for predicting clinical classes of subjects and identifying who of them need to be admitted at ED. The same pattern of results was confirming the alert included in the decision support system in order to request further testing or clinical information in some cases. In conclusion, our study does support a high impact of AI tools on COVID-19 outcomes to fight this pandemic by driving new approaches to public awareness.

N2  - Wearable sensors in healthcare monitoring have recently found widespread applications in biomedical fields for their non- or minimal-invasive, user-friendly and easy-accessible features. Sensing materials is one of the major challenges to achieve these superiorities of wearable sensors for healthcare monitoring, while graphene-based materials with many favorable properties have shown great efficiency in sensing various biochemical and biophysical signals. In this paper, we review state-of-the-art advances in the development and modification of graphene-based materials (i.e., graphene, graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide) for fabricating advanced wearable sensors with 1D (fibers), 2D (films) and 3D (foams/aerogels/hydrogels) macroscopic structures. We summarize the structural design guidelines, sensing mechanisms, applications and evolution of the graphene-based materials as wearable sensors for healthcare monitoring of biophysical signals (e.g., mechanical, thermal and electrophysiological signals) and biochemical signals from various body fluids and exhaled gases. Finally, existing challenges and future prospects are presented in this area.

N2  - While COVID-19 is still ongoing and associated with more than 5 million deaths, the scope and speed of advances over the past year in terms of scientific discovery, data dissemination, and technology have been staggering. It is not a matter of “if” but “when” we will face the next pandemic, and how we leverage technology and data management effectively to create flexible ecosystems that facilitate collaboration, equitable care, and innovation will determine its severity and scale. The aim of this review is to address emerging challenges that came to light during the pandemic in health care and innovations that enabled us to adapt and continue to care for patients. The pandemic highlighted the need for seismic shifts in care paradigms and technology with considerations related to the digital divide and health literacy for digital health interventions to reach full potential and improve health outcomes. We discuss advances in telemedicine, remote patient monitoring, and emerging wearable technologies. Despite the promise of digital health, we emphasise the importance of addressing its limitations, including interpretation challenges, accuracy of findings, and artificial intelligence–driven algorithms. We summarise the most recent recommendation of the Virtual Care Task Force to scaling virtual medical services in Canada. Finally, we propose a model for optimal implementation of health digital innovations with 5 tenets including data management, data security, digital biomarkers, useful artificial intelligence, and clinical integration.

N2  - Objective: To identify current patient and provider engagement methods that use technology in allergy and immunology clinics, in hospitals, and at home. Data Sources: Apple App Store and Google searches for allergy and immunology technology applications and PubMed search of literature involving keywords of website, technology, electronic health record, medical devices, disparity in technology, coding for remote patient monitoring, and artificial intelligence. Study Selections: Studies that addressed the keywords were included and narrowed down based on their applicability in the allergy and immunology clinic. Results: There has been rapid innovation in the digital health care space with expansion of electronic medical record services and the patient portal, creation of allergy and immunology–specific medical devices and applications with remote patient monitoring capabilities, and website and artificial intelligence development to interact with patients. Conclusion: These technological advances provide distinct advantages to the provider and patient but also have a burden of time for evaluation of the data for the provider and disparate access to certain technologies for patients. The development of these technologies has been fast-tracked since the start of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. With the explosion in telehealth and medical device development, advancement of medical technology is not revealing any signs of slowing down. It is paving a new way to interact with patients in the future.

N2  - Rationale: With the advent of the EMR, patient-generated health data (PGHD) has become more accessible, allowing for a patient-centered approach to the management of chronic asthma. Combined with artificial intelligence and remote monitoring, this data has the potential to predict asthma exacerbations and prognosis in individualized patient populations. Methods: Utilizing PRISMA guidelines, a literature search was conducted using the search terms “asthma,” “artificial intelligence,” “PGHD,” “exacerbations,” “prognosis,” and related terms. The search for this scoping review was conducted on PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Science, and EMBASE. Inclusion criteria consisted of articles published from January 2011 onwards and written in English. Duplicates were removed and review papers, abstracts, presentations, and grey literature were excluded. Results: The literature search yielded 377 articles. A preliminary review was conducted based on inclusion criteria, resulting in 15 articles. The top three variables for PGHD included vital sign monitoring via wearables (7 articles), patient-reported symptomatology (6 articles), and an element of pulmonary function testing (6 articles). Demographics and environmental exposures were each reported in 2 articles. Various forms of AI were used, the most common being random forest classifiers (6 articles). Conclusions: Existing literature has demonstrated that the utilization of PGHD in combination with AI promotes the adoption of precision medicine in asthma management. Given the heterogeneity of asthma, the ability to compute and relay real-time data to the patient and the provider can aid in the prediction and management of asthma exacerbations, but more data on demographics and environmental exposures should be considered to improve individualized prognostics.

N2  - Digital technologies have emerged in various dimensions of human life, ranging from education to professional services to wellbeing. In particular, health products and services have expanded by the use and development of artificial intelligence, mobile health applications, and wearable electronic devices. Such advancements have enabled accurate and updated tracking and modeling of health conditions. For instance, digital health technologies are capable of measuring environmental pollution and predicting its adverse health effects. Several health conditions, including chronic airway diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, can be exacerbated by pollution. These diseases impose substantial health burdens with high morbidity and mortality. Recently, efforts have been made to develop digital technologies to alleviate such conditions. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has facilitated the application of telemedicine and telemonitoring for patients with chronic airway diseases. This article reviews current trends and studies in digital technology utilization for investigating and managing environmental exposure and chronic airway diseases. First, we discussed the recent progression of digital technologies in general environmental healthcare. Then, we summarized the capacity of digital technologies in predicting exacerbation and self-management of airway diseases. Concluding these reviews, we provided suggestions to improve digital health technologies’ abilities to reduce the adverse effects of environmental exposure in chronic airway diseases, based on personal exposure-response modeling.

N2  - A new computing paradigm that has been growing in computing systems is fog computing. In the healthcare industry, Internet of Things (IoT) driven fog computing is being developed to speed up the services for the general public and save billions of lives. This new computing platform, based on the fog computing paradigm, may reduce latency when transmitting and communicating signals with faraway servers, allowing medical services to be delivered more quickly in both spatial and temporal dimensions. One of the necessary qualities of computing systems that can enable the completion of healthcare operations is latency reduction. Fog computing can provide reduced latency when compared to cloud computing due to the use of only low-end computers, mobile phones, and personal devices in fog computing. In this paper, a new framework for healthcare monitoring for managing real-Time notification based on fog computing has been proposed. The proposed system monitors the patient's body temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure values obtained from the sensors that are embedded into a wearable device and notifies the doctors or caregivers in real time if there occur any contradictions in the normal threshold value using the machine learning algorithms. The notification can also be set for the patients to alert them about the periodical medications or diet to be maintained by the patients. The cloud layer stores the big data into the cloud for future references for the hospitals and the researchers.

N2  - Human health issues must be closely examined and addressed with proper medications. Chronic illnesses such as diabetes, heart disease (HD), cancer, and chronic respiratory disease are the main causes of death worldwide. The previous 10 years have seen a lot of research into healthcare services and their technology advancements. To be more specific, the Internet of Things (IoT) has showed promise in connecting a variety of medical devices, sensors, and healthcare specialists in order to provide high-quality medical treatment in a remote place. Patient safety has improved, healthcare expenses have decreased, healthcare services have become more accessible, and the healthcare industry's operational efficiency has increased. In this paper, a diabetic patient monitoring strategy is proposed that uses an IoT-based machine learning technique called eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) to support in diabetes diagnosis and classification. A successful implementation of any classifier requires proper hyperparameter optimization. This work employed Bayesian optimization, which is a very effective method for hyper-parameter optimization, to optimize the hyper-parameters of XGBoost. The efficacy of the suggested method is assessed in terms of accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and F1score. It outperforms better than the other existing algorithms.

N2  - COVID-19 (Corona Virus) is a very transmissible infection that has the world’s attention lastly. This virus can be transmitted from any patient to other people by direct contact,it could be spread if the person sneezes or coughs. It is also spread by touching a surface that contains a virus.In this paper, the intelligent healthcare system is proposed, that integrates cloud computing technologies. Its architecture utilizes smart sensors, microcontrollers, C ++ and the Php programming languages to program the Arduino and cluad. The temperature sensor, with an accuracy of 0.5 degrees, and the sound sensor are used in this paper. These sensors will send the data of the patient to the SQL database and cloud after encryption it by RSA algorithm. Finally the data transport to the monitor and the doctor or nurse can monitor the patients from web browser from any device such as smart phones, ipads, or PC computers from any place remotely without touching the patients. This architecture can reduce the transmission of infections by touch, in addition to monitoring all cases in a hospital without potential. The system tracks the state of patients and delivers timely, reliable, and high quality healthcare with minimum cost. The presented architecture will be useful in diagnosis research and healthcare systems.The computing cloud is necessary for highly challenging architectures like intelligent healthcare. The concept of intelligent architecture healthcare systems was to provide patient surveillance at all times, in addition to real time connectivity. In addition, the sensors are required for this architecture to be applied to any patient afflicted with any disease. Therefore, by adding the sensors are required.

N2  - In this paper, we discuss our journey as academic entrepreneurs, which began when we saw a market for objective markers for the diagnosis and assessment of mental health disorders. For most of history, mental health disorders have been chiefly defined by the subjective experiences of people with these disorders - we know people have a depressive disorder because they feel depressed or that they have a psychotic disorder because they experience hallucinations. The lack of objective markers to track changes in mental health symptoms creates barriers to treatment. To address this, the vision of KeyWise AI is the further development and commercialization of an innovative digital phenotyping technology that turns smartphones into fitness trackers for the brain. We first describe how we commercialized findings derived from the ongoing citizen science BiAffect study and how our brain fitness-tracking technology supports real-time passive and unobtrusive modeling and monitoring of emotional, behavioral and cognitive processes. The core technology centers around a custom-built smartphone keyboard that replaces the default keyboard, thus allowing for unobtrusive collection of anonymized keyboard dynamics and motor kinetics metadata. We conclude this paper with some general guidelines that may help future academic entrepreneurs on their startup journey.

N2  - Over the past two periods, advancements in communication technology have exploded, with the last decade seeing an unprecedented explosion in the production of numerous cutting-edge, handheld and small communication devices. Modern, high-speed wireless communication technologies that employ complex network and communication protocols and standards have quickly supplanted the traditional wired scheme of communication. Wireless medical sensor networks are a promising application of WSNs in healthcare since they allow for remote patient monitoring (WMSNs). Reliable patient communication, patient mobility, and energy-efficient routing are at the forefront of current WMSN healthcare research developments. Nonetheless, patients' personal information is at risk when new technologies are implemented in healthcare applications without proper security measures being taken. In this study, we present a privacy-preserving strategy for the secure transfer of medical records over WSNs by combining secret sharing, and hashing. The healthcare information gathered by a wireless sensor network is broken down into subsets. In addition, a popular hashing algorithm is used to determine a unique identifier for each constituent. Any alterations to the message will result in a different hash value. Multipath routing is then used to send these parts to the servers. In order to verify the efficacy of the new method, this paper presents comprehensive simulations. The results indicate that secret splitting, in conjunction with multipath routing, aids in the maintenance of confidentiality in a wireless sensor network-based healthcare scheme.

N2  - The rapid development of communication technologies and expert systems have resulted in a large volume of medical data. Big data such as clinical data, omics data, and electronic health data are difficult to manage in real-time due to noise, large size, different formats, missing values and large features. Hence, it is more difficult for the health monitoring system to extract the correct information. Low quality and noisy data can lead to unnecessary treatment. To overcome these issues, we proposed Enriched Salp Swarm Optimization based Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (ESSOBiLSTM) to monitor health. This method consists of four layers, such as the data collection layer, data storage layer, data analytics, and presentation layer. The initial layer handles a variety of information from main sources: wearable sensor devices (WSD), social network data, and medical records (MR). The second layer stores all the collected data from WSD, MR, and social network data to the cloud server through the wireless network. The proposed framework for performing big data analytics steps like preprocessing, filtering, dimensionality reduction, and classification is performed in the third layer. In the final layer, the doctor analyzes the patient's condition based on the classification results of the enriched SSO-BiLSTM. Based on the evaluation report, the proposed ESSOBiLSTM gives an accuracy of 85%, precision of 80%, RMSE of 0.6, MAE of 0.58, recall of 85% and F-measure of 79%. As a result, ESSOBiLSTM has proven to be more effective in monitoring health in large datasets.

N2  - Objective. Internet of Things (IoT) integrates several technologies where devices learn from the experience of each other thereby reducing human-intervened likely errors. Modern technologies like IoT and machine learning enable the conventional to patient-specific approach transition in healthcare. In conventional approach, the biggest challenge faced by healthcare professionals is to predict a disease by observing the symptoms, monitoring the remote area patient, and also attending to the patient all the time after being hospitalised. IoT provides real-time data, makes decision-making smarter, and provides far superior analytics, and all these to help improve the quality of healthcare. The main objective of the work was to create an IoT-based automated system using machine learning models for symptom-based COVID-19 prognosis. Methods. Comparative analysis of predictive microbiology of COVID-19 from case symptoms using various machine learning classifiers like logistics regression, k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, random forest, decision trees, Naïve Bayes, and gradient booster is reported here. For the sake of the validation and verification of the models, performance of each model based on the retrieved cloud-stored data was measured for accuracy. Results. From the accuracy plot, it was concluded that k-NN was more accurate (97.97%) followed by decision tree (97.79), support vector machine (97.42), logistics regression (96.50), random forest (90.66), gradient boosting classifier (87.77), and Naïve Bayes (73.50) in COVID-19 prognosis. Conclusion. The paper presents a health monitoring IoT framework having high clinical significance in real-time and remote healthcare monitoring. The findings reported here and the lessons learnt shall enable the healthcare system worldwide to counter not only this ongoing COVID but many other such global pandemics the humanity may suffer from time to come.

N2  - Background: Digitalization of healthcare led to the optimization of monitoring, diagnostics, and treatment of the range of disorders. Taking into account recent situation with COVID-19 pandemics, digital technologies allowed to improve management of viral infections via remote monitoring and diagnostics of infected patients. Up to date, various mobile health applications (apps) have been proposed, including apps for the patients diagnosed with cardiovascular pathologies. Objective: The presented review aimed at the analyses of a range of mHealth solutions used to improve primary cardiac care. In addition, we studied the factors driving and hindering the wide introduction of mHealth services in the clinics. Methods: The work was based on the guidelines of the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. The publication search was carried out using PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases. Studies published during the period from 2014 until January 2022 were selected for the analysis. The evaluation of risk of bias for the included studies was conducted using the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias tool. Results and Discussion: An overall 5513 studies were assessed for eligibility after which 39 studies were included. The main trend in the mobile health for cardiological applications is the use of different types of wearable devices and Artificial Intelligence-platforms. In fact, mobile technology allows remotely to monitor, interpret, and analyze biomedical data collected from the patient. Conclusion: The results of this literature search demonstrated that patients diagnosed with cardiovascular disorders can potentially benefit from the application of mHealth in cardiology. However, despite the proven advantages of mHealth for cardiology, there are many challenges and concerns regarding effectiveness, safety, reliability and the lack of official regulation and guidelines from official organizations. Such issues require solutions and further work towards a wide implementation of mHealth technologies in cardiac practice.

N2  - Pulse signal is one of the most important physiological features of human body, which is caused by the cyclical contraction and diastole. It has great research value and broad application prospect in the detection of physiological parameters, the development of medical equipment, and the study of cardiovascular diseases and pulse diagnosis objective. In recent years, with the development of the sensor, measuring and saving of pulse signal has become very convenient. Now the pulse signal feature analysis is a hotspot and difficulty in the signal processing field. Therefore, to realize pulse signal automatic analysis and recognition is vital significance in the aspects of the noninvasive diagnosis and remote monitoring, etc. In this article, we combined the pulse signal feature extraction in time and frequency domain and convolution neural network to analyze the pulse signal. Firstly, a theory of wavelet transform and the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) which is gradually developed in recent years have been used to remove the noises in the pulse signal. Moreover, a method of feature point detection based on differential threshold method is proposed which realized the accurate positioning and extraction time-domain values. Finally, a deep learning method based on one-dimensional CNN has been utilized to make the classification of multiple pulse signals in the article. In conclusion, a deep learning method is proposed for the pulse signal classification combined with the feature extraction in time and frequency domain in this article.

N2  - Healthcare occupies a central role in sustainable societies and has an undeniable impact on the well-being of individuals. However, over the years, various diseases have adversely affected the growth and sustainability of these societies. Among them, heart disease is escalating rapidly in both economically settled and undeveloped nations and leads to fatalities around the globe. To reduce the death ratio caused by this disease, there is a need for a framework to continuously monitor a patient's heart status, essentially doing early detection and prediction of heart disease. This paper proposes a scalable Machine Learning (ML) and Internet of Things-(IoT-) based three-layer architecture to store and process a large amount of clinical data continuously, which is needed for the early detection and monitoring of heart disease. Layer 1 of the proposed framework is used to collect data from IoT wearable/implanted smart sensor nodes, which includes various physiological measures that have significant impact on the deterioration of heart status. Layer 2 stores and processes the patient data on a local web server using various ML classification algorithms. Finally, Layer 3 is used to store the critical data of patients on the cloud. The doctor and other caregivers can access the patient health conditions via an android application, provide services to the patient, and inhibit him/her from further damage. Various performance evaluation measures such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1-measure, MCC-score, and ROC curve are used to check the efficiency of our proposed IoT-based heart disease prediction framework. It is anticipated that this system will assist the healthcare sector and the doctors in diagnosing heart patients in the initial phases.

N2  - Real-time effective ECG data collecting, transmitting, and monitoring system with feature extraction is a big challenge in biomedical signal processing. The electrocardiogram is a widely used testing system to measure and analyse coronary heart diseases, i.e., cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Heart rate remote monitoring under the service provided by hospital equipment is the technology that currently needs to improve. IoT enabled medical device helps to achieve this efficiently. To design such systems energy-efficient communication protocol, data-transfer minimisation, assurance of delivery (security), heterogeneous natures of the environment are necessary considerations. This paper outlines a literature survey of three main important areas; ‘real-time ECG monitoring using wearable sensors’, ‘feature extraction and classification method for real-time ECG monitoring’, and ‘secured IoT protocol for real-time ECG monitoring’.

N2  - The outburst of the coronavirus is in the phase of development due to lack of precise diagnosis needed by patients. Because the virus spreads quickly from a corona positive individual to the others, the health of any area that is densely inhabited is quite important. Presently, medical community has reached a disaster level since the number of cases are rising very fast and the medical facilities are very limited. Therefore, it is high time that an intelligent model is conceived and developed for monitoring the symptoms of patient health online, then estimate and find the anomaly in the health status of patient further. By assessing the tracked health parameters in this way, a corona virus-infected patient's health condition may be analysed using a well-adapted prediction model. In this study, an overview on the benchmark approaches utilized in recent remote monitoring in covid 19 diagnosis studies is provided where the different algorithms are elucidated and the comparison between the advantages is performed. Also, the problems and drawbacks that covid 19 diagnosis research encounters commonly is discussed. On the whole, this article comprehensively delves into the field of automated remote monitoring in covid 19 diagnosis and also the future research endeavors in this field are put forward.

N2  - Cardiac arrhythmias – the most common of which is atrial fibrillation – are a leading cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Mobile health (mHealth) and wearable devices are a fast-evolving and disruptive area of innovation in assessing both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients for cardiac rhythm abnormalities. Remote monitoring has been used in cardiovascular health monitoring since the invention of the Holter monitor; however, mHealth devices, ranging from smartphones and watches to rings and textiles, have rapidly evolved in their potential uses. These devices are in the early stages of investigation in prospective clinical trials designed to validate their accuracy and, more recently, assess the potential benefits of their use on cardiovascular outcomes. We explored the potential societal and health benefits of using wearable technologies to improve the early diagnosis of arrhythmias by evaluating the current evidence for their use in clinical practice and proposing a framework for integrating them into diagnostic pathways.

N2  - In this article, we present current methodologies, available technologies, and demands for monitoring various respiratory parameters. We discuss the importance of noninvasive techniques for remote and continuous monitoring and challenges involved in the current 'smart and connected health' era. We conducted an extensive literature review on the medical significance of monitoring respiratory vital parameters, along with the current methods and solutions with their respective advantages and disadvantages. We discuss the challenges of developing a noninvasive, wearable, wireless system that continuously monitors respiration parameters and opportunities in the field and then determine the requirements of a state-of-the-art system. Noninvasive techniques provide a significant amount of medical information for a continuous patient monitoring system. Contact methods offer more advantages than non-contact methods; however, reducing the size and power of contact methods is critical for enabling a wearable, wireless medical monitoring system. Continuous and accurate remote monitoring, along with other physiological data, can help caregivers improve the quality of care and allow patients greater freedom outside the hospital. Such monitoring systems could lead to highly tailored treatment plans, shorten patient stays at medical facilities, and reduce the cost of treatment.

N2  - Recently, flexible wearable electronic devices have attracted immense interest as an alternative for conventional rigid metallic conductors in personal healthcare monitoring, human motion detection, and sensory skins, owing to their intrinsic characteristics. However, the practical applications of most wearable sensors are generally limited by their poor stretchability and sensitivity, unsatisfactory strength, lower conductivity, and single sensory function. Here a hydrogen bond cross-linked network based on carboxylic styrene butadiene rubber (XSBR) and hydrophilic sericin (SS) non-covalently modified carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is rationally designed and then fabricated into multi-functional sensors. The resultant versatile sensors are able to detect both weak and large deformations, which owns a low detection limit of 1% strain, high stretchability up to 217%, superior strength of 12.58 MPa, high sensitivity with a gauge factor up to 25.98, high conductivity of 0.071 S m-1 , and lower percolation threshold of 0.504 wt%. Moreover, the prepared sensors also possess an impressively thermal response (0.01636 °C-1 ) and realize the application in the measurement of human body temperature. The multifunctional and scalable XSBR/SSCNT sensor with the integrated tracking capabilities of real-time and in situ physiological signals, providing a promising route to develop wearable artificial intelligence in human health and sporting applications.

N2  - In the past few years, remote monitoring technologies have grown increasingly important in the delivery of healthcare. According to healthcare professionals, a variety of factors influence the public perception of connected healthcare systems in a variety of ways. First and foremost, wearable technology in healthcare must establish better bonds with the individuals who will be using them. The emotional reactions of patients to obtaining remote healthcare services may be of interest to healthcare practitioners if they are given the opportunity to investigate them. In this study, we develop an artificial intelligence-based classification system that aims to detect the emotions from the input data using metaheuristic feature selection and machine learning classification. The proposed model is made to undergo series of steps involving preprocessing, feature selection, and classification. The simulation is conducted to test the efficacy of the model on various features present in a dataset. The results of simulation show that the proposed model is effective enough to classify the emotions from the input dataset than other existing methods.

N2  - A smart city is an intelligent space, in which large amounts of data are collected and analyzed using low-cost sensors and automatic algorithms. The application of artificial intelligence and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in electronic health (E-health) can efficiently promote the development of sustainable and smart cities. The IoT sensors and intelligent algorithms enable the remote monitoring and analyzing of the healthcare data of patients, which reduces the medical and travel expenses in cities. Existing deep learning-based methods for healthcare sensor data classification have made great achievements. However, these methods take much time and storage space for model training and inference. They are difficult to be deployed in small devices to classify the physiological signal of patients in real time. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a micro time series classification model called the micro neural network (MicroNN). The proposed model is micro enough to be deployed on tiny edge devices. MicroNN can be applied to long-term physiological signal monitoring based on edge computing devices. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the classification accuracy and computation complexity of MicroNN. Experiment results show that MicroNN performs better than the state-of-the-art methods. The accuracies on the two datasets (MIT-BIH-AR and INCART) are 98.4% and 98.1%, respectively. Finally, we present an application to show how MicroNN can improve the development of sustainable and smart cities.

KW  - smartphone
N2  - In recent days, research in human activity recognition (HAR) has played a significant role in healthcare systems. The accurate activity classification results from the HAR enhance the performance of the healthcare system with broad applications. HAR results are useful in monitoring a person's health, and the system predicts abnormal activities based on user movements. The HAR system's abnormal activity predictions provide better healthcare monitoring and reduce users' health issues. The conventional HAR systems use wearable sensors, such as inertial measurement unit (IMU) and stretch sensors for activity recognition. These approaches show remarkable performances to the user's basic activities such as sitting, standing, and walking. However, when the user performs complex activities, such as running, jumping, and lying, the sensor-based HAR systems have a higher degree of misclassification results due to the reading errors from sensors. These sensor errors reduce the overall performance of the HAR system with the worst classification results. Similarly, radiofrequency or vision-based HAR systems are not free from classification errors when used in real time. In this paper, we address some of the existing challenges of HAR systems by proposing a human image threshing (HIT) machine-based HAR system that uses an image dataset from a smartphone camera for activity recognition. The HIT machine effectively uses a mask region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN) for human body detection, a facial image threshing machine (FIT) for image cropping and resizing, and a deep learning model for activity classification. We demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed HIT machine-based HAR system through extensive experiments and results. The proposed HIT machine achieved 98.53% accuracy when the ResNet architecture was used as its deep learning model.

N2  - According to World Health Organization statistics, falls are the second leading cause of unintentional injury deaths worldwide. With older people being particularly vulnerable, detecting, and reporting falls have been the focus of numerous health technology studies. We screened 267 studies and selected 15 that detailed pervasive fall detection and alerting apps that used smartphone accelerometers. The fall datasets used for the analyses included between 4 and 38 participants and contained data from young and old subjects, with the recorded falls performed exclusively by young subjects. Threshold-based detection was implemented in six cases, while machine learning approaches were implemented in the other nine, including decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, boosting, and neural networks. All methods could ultimately achieve real-time detection, with reported sensitivities ranging from 60.4 to 99.3% and specificities from 74.6 to 100.0%. However, the studies had limitations in their experimental set-ups or considered a restricted scope of daily activities-not always representative of daily life-with which to define falls during the development of their algorithms. Finally, the studies omitted some aspects of data science methodology, such as proper test sets for results evaluation, putting into question whether reported results would correspond to real-world performance. The two primary outcomes of our review are: a ranking of selected articles based on bias risk and a set of 12 impactful and actionable recommendations for future work in fall detection.

N2  - Digital measures are increasingly used as objective health measures in remote-monitoring settings. In addition to their use in purely clinical research, such as in clinical trials, one promising application area for sensor-derived digital measures is in technology-assisted ageing and ageing-related research. In this context, digital measures may be used to measure the risk of certain adverse events such as falls, and also to provide novel research insights into ageing and ageing-related conditions, like cognitive impairment. While major emphasis has been placed on deriving one or more digital measures from wearable devices, a more holistic approach inspired by systems biology that leverages large, non-exhaustive sets of digital measures may prove highly beneficial. Such an approach would be useful if combined with modern big data approaches like machine learning. As such, extensive sets of digital measures, which may be referred to as digital behavioromes, could help characterise new phenotypes in deep phenotyping efforts. These measures could also assist in the discovery of novel digital biomarkers or in the creation of digital clinical outcome assessments. While clinical research into digital measures focuses primarily on measures derived from wearable devices, proven technology used for long-term remote monitoring of older adults is generally contactless, unobtrusive, and privacy-preserving. In this context, we introduce and describe a digital behaviorome: a large, non-exhaustive set of digital measures based entirely on contactless, unobtrusive, and privacy-preserving sensor technologies. We also demonstrate how such a behaviorome can be used to build digital clinical outcome assessments that are relevant to ageing and derived from machine learning. These outcomes included fall risk, frailty, mild cognitive impairment, and late-life depression. With the exception of late-life depression, all digital outcome assessments demonstrated a promising ability (ROC AUC ≥ 0.7) to discriminate between positive and negative health outcomes, often in the range of comparable work with wearable devices. Finally, we highlight the possibility of using these digital behaviorome-based outcome assessments to discover novel potential digital biomarkers for each outcome. Here, we found reasonable contributors but also some potentially interesting new candidates regarding fall risk and mild cognitive impairment.

N2  - With the rapid development of society in recent decades, the wearable sensor has attracted attention for motion-based health care and artificial applications. However, there are still many limitations to applying them in real life, particularly the inconvenience that comes from their large size and non-flexible systems. To solve these problems, flexible small-sized sensors that use body motion as a stimulus are studied to directly collect more accurate and diverse signals. In particular, tactile sensors are applied directly on the skin and provide input signals of motion change for the flexible reading device. This review provides information about different types of tactile sensors and their working mechanisms that are piezoresistive, piezocapacitive, piezoelectric, and triboelectric. Moreover, this review presents not only the applications of the tactile sensor in motion sensing and health care monitoring, but also their contributions in the field of artificial intelligence in recent years. Other applications, such as human behavior studies, are also suggested.

N2  - The use of wearable sensors allows continuous recordings of physical activity from participants in free-living or at-home clinical studies. The large amount of data collected demands automatic analysis pipelines to extract gait parameters that can be used as clinical endpoints. We introduce a deep learning-based automatic pipeline for wearables that processes tri-axial accelerometry data and extracts gait events-bout segmentation, initial contact (IC), and final contact (FC)-from a single sensor located at either the lower back (near L5), shin or wrist. The gait events detected are posteriorly used for gait parameter estimation, such as step time, length, and symmetry. We report results from a leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) validation on a pilot study dataset of five participants clinically diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (PD) and six healthy controls (HC). Participants wore sensors at three body locations and walked on a pressure-sensing walkway to obtain reference gait data. Mean absolute errors (MAE) for the IC events ranged from 22.82 to 33.09 milliseconds (msecs) for the lower back sensor while for the shin and wrist sensors, MAE ranges were 28.56-64.66 and 40.19-72.50 msecs, respectively. For the FC-event detection, MAE ranges were 29.06-48.42, 40.19-72.70 and 36.06-60.18 msecs for the lumbar, wrist and shin sensors, respectively. Intraclass correlation coefficients, ICC(2,k), between the estimated parameters and the reference data resulted in good-to-excellent agreement (ICC ≥ 0.84) for the lumbar and shin sensors, excluding the double support time (ICC = 0.37 lumbar and 0.38 shin) and swing time (ICC = 0.55 lumbar and 0.59 shin). The wrist sensor also showed good agreements, but the ICCs were lower overall than for the other two sensors. Our proposed analysis pipeline has the potential to extract up to 100 gait-related parameters, and we expect our contribution will further support developments in the fields of wearable sensors, digital health, and remote monitoring in clinical trials.

N2  - With the rising amount of data in the sports and health sectors, a plethora of applications using big data mining have become possible. Multiple frameworks have been proposed to mine, store, preprocess, and analyze physiological vitals data using artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms. Comparatively, less research has been done to collect potentially high volume, high-quality ‘big data’ in an organized, time-synchronized, and holistic manner to solve similar problems in multiple fields. Although a large number of data collection devices exist in the form of sensors. They are either highly specialized, univariate and fragmented in nature or exist in a lab setting. The current study aims to propose artificial intelligence-based body sensor network framework (AIBSNF), a framework for strategic use of body sensor networks (BSN), which combines with real-time location system (RTLS) and wearable biosensors to collect multivariate, low noise, and high-fidelity data. This facilitates gathering of time-synchronized location and physiological vitals data, which allows artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML)-based time series analysis. The study gives a brief overview of wearable sensor technology, RTLS, and provides use cases of AI/ML algorithms in the field of sensor fusion. The study also elaborates sample scenarios using a specific sensor network consisting of pressure sensors (insoles), accelerometers, gyroscopes, ECG, EMG, and RTLS position detectors for particular applications in the field of health care and sports. The AIBSNF may provide a solid blueprint for conducting research and development, forming a smooth end-to-end pipeline from data collection using BSN, RTLS and final stage analytics based on AI/ML algorithms.

N2  - The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption of innovative healthcare methods, including remote patient monitoring. In the setting of limited healthcare resources, outpatient management of individuals newly diagnosed with COVID-19 was commonly implemented, some taking advantage of various personal health technologies, but only rarely using a multi-parameter chest-patch for continuous monitoring. Here we describe the development and validation of a COVID-19 decompensation index (CDI) model based on chest patch-derived continuous sensor data to predict COVID-19 hospitalizations in outpatient-managed COVID-19 positive individuals, achieving an overall AUC of the ROC Curve of 0.84 on 308 event negative participants, and 22 event positive participants, out of an overall study cohort of 400 participants. We retrospectively compare the performance of CDI to standard of care modalities, finding that the machine learning model outperforms the standard of care modalities in terms of both numbers of events identified and with a lower false alarm rate. While only a pilot phase study, the CDI represents a promising application of machine learning within a continuous remote patient monitoring system.

N2  - The use of wearables is increasing and data from these devices could improve the prediction of changes in glycemic control. We conducted a randomized trial with adults with prediabetes who were given either a waist-worn or wrist-worn wearable to track activity patterns. We collected baseline information on demographics, medical history, and laboratory testing. We tested three models that predicted changes in hemoglobin A1c that were continuous, improved glycemic control by 5% or worsened glycemic control by 5%. Consistently in all three models, prediction improved when (a) machine learning was used vs. traditional regression, with ensemble methods performing the best; (b) baseline information with wearable data was used vs. baseline information alone; and (c) wrist-worn wearables were used vs. waist-worn wearables. These findings indicate that models can accurately identify changes in glycemic control among prediabetic adults, and this could be used to better allocate resources and target interventions to prevent progression to diabetes.

N2  - Background: Patients with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) are at a high risk of malignant ventricular arrhythmias. The use of remote ICD monitoring, wearable devices, and patient-reported outcomes generate large volumes of potential valuable data. Artificial intelligence–based methods can be used to develop personalized prediction models and improve early-warning systems. Objective: The purpose of this study was to develop an integrated web-based personalized prediction engine for ICD therapy. Methods: This international, multicenter, prospective, observational study consists of 2 phases: (1) a development study and (2) a feasibility study. We plan to enroll 400 participants with an ICD (with or without cardiac resynchronization therapy) on remote monitoring: 300 participants in the development study and 100 in the feasibility study. During 12-month follow-up, electronic health record data, remote monitoring data, accelerometry-assessed physical behavior data, and patient-reported data are collected. By using machine- and deep-learning approaches, a prediction engine is developed to assess the risk probability of ICD therapy (shock and antitachycardia pacing). The feasibility of the prediction engine as a clinical tool, the SafeHeart Platform, is assessed during the feasibility study. Results: Development study recruitment commenced in 2021. The feasibility study starts in 2022. Conclusion: SafeHeart is the first study to prospectively collect a multimodal data set to construct a personalized prediction engine for ICD therapy. Moreover, SafeHeart explores the integration and added value of detailed objective accelerometer data in the prediction of clinical events. The translation of the SafeHeart Platform to clinical practice is examined during the feasibility study.

N2  - On account of privacy preserving issue and health-care monitoring, physiological signal biometric authentication system has gained popularity in recent years. Seismocardiogram (SCG) is now easily accessible owing to the advance of wearable sensor technology. However, SCG biometric has not been widely explored due to the challenging motion artifact removal. In this paper, we design placing the sensors at different body parts under different activities to determine the best sensor location. In addition, we develop SCG noise removal algorithm and utilize machine learning approach to perform biometric authentication tasks. We validate the proposed methods on 20 healthy young adults. The dataset contains acceleration data of sitting, standing, walking, and sitting post-exercise activities with the sensor placed at the wrists, neck, heart and sternum. We demonstrate that vertical and dorsal-ventral SCG near the heart and the sternum produce reliable SCG biometric evidenced by achieving the state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, we present the efficacy of the devised noise removal procedure in the authentication during walking motion.Clinical relevance- A seismocardiography-based biometric authentication system can help serve privacy preserving and reveal cardiovascular functioning information in clinics.

N2  - Epitel has developed Epilog, a miniature, wireless, wearable electroencephalography (EEG) sensor. Four Epilog sensors are combined as part of Epitel's Remote EEG Monitoring platform (REMI) to create 10 channels of EEG for remote patient monitoring. REMI is designed to provide comprehensive spatial EEG recordings that can be administered by non-specialized medical personnel in any medical center. The purpose of this study was to determine how accurate epileptologists are at remotely reviewing Epilog sensor EEG in the 10-channel “REMI montage,” with and without seizure detection support software. Three board certified epileptologists reviewed the REMI montage from 20 subjects who wore four Epilog sensors for up to 5 days alongside traditional video-EEG in the EMU, 10 of whom experienced a total of 24 focal-onset electrographic seizures and 10 of whom experienced no seizures or epileptiform activity. Epileptologists randomly reviewed the same datasets with and without clinical decision support annotations from an automated seizure detection algorithm tuned to be highly sensitive. Blinded consensus review of unannotated Epilog EEG in the REMI montage detected people who were experiencing electrographic seizure activity with 90% sensitivity and 90% specificity. Consensus detection of individual focal onset seizures resulted in a mean sensitivity of 61%, precision of 80%, and false detection rate (FDR) of 0.002 false positives per hour (FP/h) of data. With algorithm seizure detection annotations, the consensus review mean sensitivity improved to 68% with a slight increase in FDR (0.005 FP/h). As seizure detection software, the automated algorithm detected people who were experiencing electrographic seizure activity with 100% sensitivity and 70% specificity, and detected individual focal onset seizures with a mean sensitivity of 90% and mean false alarm rate of 0.087 FP/h. This is the first study showing epileptologists' ability to blindly review EEG from four Epilog sensors in the REMI montage, and the results demonstrate the clinical potential to accurately identify patients experiencing electrographic seizures. Additionally, the automated algorithm shows promise as clinical decision support software to detect discrete electrographic seizures in individual records as accurately as FDA-cleared predicates.

N2  - Background: In the real world, medical practice is changing hand in hand with the development of new Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems and problems from different areas have been successfully solved using AI algorithms. Specifically, the use of AI techniques in setting up or building precision medicine is significant in terms of the accuracy of disease discovery and tailored treatment. Moreover, with the use of technology, clinical personnel can deliver a very much efficient healthcare service. Objective: This article reviews AI state-of-the-art in cardiovascular disease management, focusing on diagnostic and therapeutic improvements. Methods: To that end, we conducted a detailed PubMed search on AI application from distinct areas of cardiology: heart failure, arterial hypertension, atrial fibrillation, syncope and cardiovascular rehabilitation. Particularly, to assess the impact of these technologies in clinical decision-making, this research considers technical and medical aspects. Results: On one hand, some devices in heart failure, atrial fibrillation and cardiac rehabilitation represent an inexpensive, not invasive or not very invasive approach to long-term surveillance and management in these areas. On the other hand, the availability of large datasets (big data) is a useful tool to predict the development and outcome of many cardiovascular diseases. In summary, with this new guided therapy, the physician can supply prompt, individualised, and tailored treatment and the patients feel safe as they are continuously monitored, with a significant psychological effect. Conclusion: Soon, tailored patient care via telemonitoring can improve clinical practice because AI-based systems support cardiologists in daily medical activities, improving disease detection and treatment. However, the physician-patient relationship remains a pivotal step.

N2  - Research Objectives: To investigate the accuracy of four discriminant analysis methods to classify activities of subjects with Parkinson's Disease (PD) to support remote monitoring of performance using wearable sensors. Design: Activities were classified using computational methods and compared to manually tagged activities performed in random order by PD subjects during a cross-sectional study. Setting: Activities were performed in the Motion Analysis lab at an outpatient rehabilitation center. Participants: Five PD subjects (mean age: 63.5±2.6 years, mean Hoehn-Yahr score: 2) performed activities during the on-medication state. Interventions: Four wearable sensors were used to capture the motion of subjects during a parkour of six activities. Motion data were used to train and test four discriminant analysis methods. Main Outcome Measures: Three-dimensional components and magnitudes of acceleration and angular rate of sensors located on the foot, thigh, pelvis, and wrist were registered at a sampling rate of 250 Hz. Data were preprocessed using a lowpass 2nd order Butterworth filter with a cutoff frequency of 5 Hz and smoothed using a moving-average filter with a window size of 6.4 s. Thirteen predictors were used to train and test 4 discriminant analysis methods: linear, quadratic, naïve Bayes (NB) with normal, and NB with kernel distribution. The skewness and normality of each predictor were calculated. Discriminant analysis methods were validated using the 5-fold cross-validation method. Accuracy for each method was calculated. All data processing analysis was performed in Matlab 2020. Results: A total of 179,555 observations were used to train and validate discriminant analysis methods. None of the predictors showed a normal distribution and 6 of them presented high skewness. The lowest accuracy was obtained by linear discriminant analysis (55.9%). Best accuracy was obtained for naïve Bayes with kernel distribution (60.7%) because it does not require normally distributed data and supports skewness in predictors. Conclusions: Discriminant analysis using naïve Bayes with kernel distribution has the potential to identify activities that could be helpful to support remote monitoring of the performance of PD subjects using wearable sensors. Author(s) Disclosures: All authors declare no conflicts.

N2  - Background: Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is an effective treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), but treatment compliance is often unsatisfactory. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an intelligent monitoring system for improving CPAP compliance. Methods: This is a prospective, open label, parallel, randomized controlled trial including 60 newly diagnosed patients with OSA requiring CPAP (Apnea-Hypopnea Index [AHI] >15) from Lleida, Spain. Participants were randomized (1:1) to standard management or the MiSAOS intelligent monitoring system, involving (1) early compliance detection, thus providing measures of patient's CPAP compliance from the very first days of usage; (2) machine learning-based prediction of midterm future CPAP compliance; and (3) rule-based recommendations for the patient (app) and care team. Clinical and anthropometric variables, daytime sleepiness, and quality of life were recorded at baseline and after 6 months, together with patient's compliance, satisfaction, and health care costs. Results: Randomized patients had a mean age of 57 (SD 11) years, mean AHI of 50 (SD 27), and 13% (8/60) were women. Patients in the intervention arm had a mean (95% CI) of 1.14 (0.04-2.23) hours/day higher adjusted CPAP compliance than controls (P=.047). Patients' satisfaction was excellent in both arms, and up to 88% (15/17) of intervention patients reported willingness to keep using the MiSAOS app in the future. No significant differences were found in costs (control: mean €90.2 (SD 53.14) (US $105.76 [SD 62.31]); intervention: mean €96.2 (SD 62.13) (US $112.70 [SD 72.85]); P=.70; €1=US $1.17 was considered throughout). Overall costs combined with results on compliance demonstrated cost-effectiveness in a bootstrap-based simulation analysis. Conclusions: A machine learning-based intelligent monitoring system increased daily compliance, reported excellent patient satisfaction similar to that reported in usual care, and did not incur in a substantial increase in costs, thus proving cost-effectiveness. This study supports the implementation of intelligent eHealth frameworks for the management of patients with CPAP-treated OSA and confirms the value of patients' empowerment in the management of chronic diseases.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: We report on our experience of deploying a continuous remote patient monitoring (CRPM) study soft launch with structured cascading and escalation pathways on heart failure (HF) patients post-discharge. The lessons learned from the soft launch are used to modify and fine-tune the workflow process and study protocol. METHODS: This soft launch was conducted at NorthShore University HealthSystem's Evanston Hospital from December 2020 to March 2021. Patients were provided with non-invasive wearable biosensors that continuously collect ambulatory physiological data, and a study phone that collects patient-reported outcomes. The physiological data are analyzed by machine learning algorithms, potentially identifying physiological perturbation in HF patients. Alerts from this algorithm may be cascaded with other patient status data to inform home health nurses' (HHNs') management via a structured protocol. HHNs review the monitoring platform daily. If the patient's status meets specific criteria, HHNs perform assessments and escalate patient cases to the HF team for further guidance on early intervention. RESULTS: We enrolled five patients into the soft launch. Four participants adhered to study activities. Two out of five patients were readmitted, one due to HF, one due to infection. Observed miscommunication and protocol gaps were noted for protocol amendment. The study team adopted an organizational development method from change management theory to reconfigure the study protocol. CONCLUSION: We sought to automate the monitoring aspects of post-discharge care by aligning a new technology that generates streaming data from a wearable device with a complex, multi-provider workflow into a novel protocol using iterative design, implementation, and evaluation methods to monitor post-discharge HF patients. CRPM with structured escalation and telemonitoring protocol shows potential to maintain patients in their home environment and reduce HF-related readmissions. Our results suggest that further education to engage and empower frontline workers using advanced technology is essential to scale up the approach.

N2  - Respiration rate is a vital parameter which is useful for the earlier identification of diseases. In this context, various types of devices have been fabricated and developed to monitor different breath rates. However, the disposability and biocompatibility of such sensors and the poor classification of different breath rates from sensor data are significant issues in medical services. This report attempts to focus on two important things: the classification of respiration signals from sensor data using deep learning and the disposability of devices. The use of the novel Janus MoSSe quantum dot (MoSSe QD) structure allows for stable respiration sensing because of unchanged wear rates under humid conditions, and also, the electron affinity and work function values suggest that MoSSe has a higher tendency to donate electrons and interact with the hydrogen molecule. Furthermore, for the real-time classification of different respiration signals, a 1D convolutional neural network (1D CNN) was incorporated. This algorithm was applied to four different breath patterns which achieved a state-of-the-art 10-trial accuracy of 98.18% for normal, 95.25% for slow, 97.64% for deep, and 98.18% for fast breaths. The successful demonstration of a stable, low-cost, and disposable respiration sensor with a highly accurate classification of signals is a major step ahead in developing wearable respiration sensors for future personal healthcare monitoring systems.

N2  - Heart failure (HF) patients represent one of the most prevalent as well as one of the most fragile population encountered in the cardiology and internal medicine departments nowadays. Estimated to account for around 26 million people worldwide, diagnosed patients present a poor prognosis and quality of life with a clinical history accompanied by repeated hospital admissions caused by an exacerbation of their chronic condition. The frequent hospitalizations and the extended hospital stays mean an extremely high economic burden for healthcare institutions. Meanwhile, the number of chronically diseased and elderly patients is continuously rising, and a lack of specialized physicians is evident. To cope with this health emergency, more efficient strategies for patient management, more accurate diagnostic tools, and more efficient preventive plans are needed. In recent years, telemonitoring has been introduced as the potential answer to solve such needs. Different methodologies and devices have been progressively investigated for effective home monitoring of cardiologic patients. Invasive hemodynamic devices, such as CardioMEMS™, have been demonstrated to be reducing hospitalizations and mortality, but their use is however restricted to limited cases. The role of external non-invasive devices for remote patient monitoring, instead, is yet to be clarified. In this review, we summarized the most relevant studies and devices that, by utilizing non-invasive telemonitoring, demonstrated whether beneficial effects in the management of HF patients were effective.

N2  - Background and objective: E-health is a growing research topic, especially with the expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT). Miniaturized wearable sensors are auspicious tools for biomedicine and healthcare systems. In this paper, we present D-SORM, a sensor fusion-based digital solution intended to assist clinicians and improve their diagnosis by providing objective measurements and automatic recognition. The aim is to supply an interface for remote monitoring to the medical staff. Methods: D-SORM platform estimates the wearable device attitude based on its acquired data, and visualizes it in real-time using a graphical user interface (GUI). It also integrates two modules which serve two different medical applications. The first one is arm tele-rehabilitation, where sessions are done online. The practitioner gives the instructions while wearing the device, and the patient has to reproduce the gestures. A processing unit is dedicated to compute statistical features and calculate the success rate. The second one is human motion tracking for elderly care. A novel machine learning architecture is proposed, based on feature fusion, to predict the activities of daily living. Results: The rehabilitation mechanism was tested under supervised conditions, by performing a set of movements. D-SORM provides extra information and objective measurements, thus facilitates the diagnosis of clinicians. The human activity recognition is also validated using a public dataset. With D-SORM, an efficiency ranging from 97.7% to 99.65% is ensured under unsupervised conditions. Conclusions: The proposed design constitutes a digital clinical tool for medical teams allowing remote health monitoring. It overcomes geographical barriers while providing faster and highly accurate assessment.

N2  - COVID-19 exerts deleterious cardiopulmonary effects, leading to a worse prognosis in the most affected. This retrospective multi-center observational cohort study aimed to analyze the trajectories of key vitals amongst hospitalized COVID-19 patients using a chest-patch wearable providing continuous remote patient monitoring of numerous vital signs. The study was conducted in five COVID-19 isolation units. A total of 492 COVID-19 patients were included in the final analysis. Physiological parameters were measured every 15 min. More than 3 million measurements were collected including heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, cardiac output, cardiac index, systemic vascular resistance, respiratory rate, blood oxygen saturation, and body temperature. Cardiovascular deterioration appeared early after admission and in parallel with changes in the respiratory parameters, showing a significant difference in trajectories within sub-populations at high risk. Early detection of cardiovascular deterioration of COVID-19 patients is achievable when using frequent remote patient monitoring.

N2  - The considerable characteristics of 5G technology (Fifth Generation of telecommunication) is the very high amount of data that can be transmitted in the time unit (data speed: Megabits per second - throughput) and the very low delay in data exchange (latency). ElectroMagnetic Fields (EMFs) are used for decades for communication reasons and broadcasting. 700 MHz and lower frequencies are currently being used in Digital TV. Low frequencies (800, 900 MHz) are also being used in previous (but still existing) technologies 2G, 3G, 4G, 4G+. 5G will exploit both low and high frequencies. 5G will be operation mainly in a low band (700 MHz) and a high band (3.5 GHz). In the near future mmWave bands will also be used above 6 GHz (for example 24 GHz, 28 GHz and above). Theoretical models and live measurements have consistently shown that the actual maximum power is always less than the 25% of the maximum peak power of a Massive-MIMO antenna. ICNIRP has published in 1998 “Guidelines for Limiting Exposure to Electromagnetic Fields (100 kHz to 300 GHz)”. The current revision (2020) is based on the same criteria, but it exhibits more accuracy in dosimetry calculations, considering details and based on better biological rationale. mmWave bands (> 6 GHz) is a controversial issue for the population. Reports did not show adverse health effects in daily life under the safety limits. WHO is currently preparing a review about health risks assessment of RF exposure (including mm-Waves), which will be completed by 2022. There is no evidence of adverse health effects at exposure levels below the basic restrictions as described in the ICNIRP (1998) and ICNIRP (2020) guidelines and no evidence of an interaction mechanism that would predict that adverse health effects could occur due to radiofrequency EMF exposure below restriction levels. The new Guidelines provide protection against all adverse health effects, regardless of whether they are due to acute or chronic exposures, regardless of age or health status. Radio and Microwave Frequencies, where mobile technology and Wi-Fi operate, are used in Medicine for therapeutic or diagnostic purposes. These bands are used for various application as Microwave Diathermy (same band as 2G, 3G and Wi-Fi technologies), Microwave induced thermoacoustic echography (same band as 4G technology), Medical Imaging / localization of tumors (same bands as 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G technologies) and Medical Monitoring / Measurement of vital function as respiration and heart rate (same band as the forthcoming mmWave 5G). By utilizing new technologies that are involved in 5G communication (IoT and mmWave frequencies) healthcare systems can improve the quality of care, provide more personalized and preventive care and reduce the cost of care.

N2  - Purpose of reviewArtificial intelligence is the ability for machines to perform intelligent tasks. Artificial intelligence is already penetrating many aspects of medicine including cardiac surgery. Here, we offer a platform introduction to artificial intelligence for cardiac surgeons to understand the implementations of this transformative tool.Recent findingsArtificial intelligence has contributed greatly to the automation of cardiac imaging, including echocardiography, cardiac computed tomography, cardiac MRI and most recently, in radiomics. There are also several artificial intelligence based clinical prediction tools that predict complex outcomes after cardiac surgery. Waveform analysis, specifically, automated electrocardiogram analysis, has seen significant strides with promise in wearables and remote monitoring. Experimentally, artificial intelligence has also entered the operating room in the form of augmented reality and automated robotic surgery.SummaryArtificial intelligence has many potential exciting applications in cardiac surgery. It can streamline physician workload and help make medicine more human again by placing the physician back at the bedside. Here, we offer cardiac surgeons an introduction to this transformative tool so that they may actively participate in creating clinically relevant implementations to improve our practice.

N2  - INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Radical cystectomy (RC) has 30-day and 90-day re-admission rates of over 15% and 20% respectively. The majority of complications are infection and bowelrelated. Modern Bluetooth-enabled commercial wearable devices such as smart watches can measure and transmit a patient's health data directly to a mobile phone. Data is either stored on the phone for future retrieval or uploaded to a web server in real-time to facilitate remote patient monitoring. In this study, we test the feasibility of remote monitoring for 30 days in patients discharged from hospital following RC. METHODS: As part of the DREAMPath (ISRCTN62293620) study, patients were provided with an iPhone, Apple Watch Series 4 and three Bluetooth peripherals (sphygmomanometer, pulse oximeter, thermometer). They were instructed to wear the Apple Watch at all times, and measure their observations twice a day. Additionally, patients were asked to complete a quality of recovery 15 questionnaire daily. At the end of 30 days, re-admission data was collected. A backend data pipeline has also been developed to process collected data, allowing us to develop clinically-useful analytics. The primary focus is on developing anomaly detection and machine learning models that predict premature hospital re-admission. RESULTS: 20 patients have been recruited into the study. At the time of our analysis, 5,687 data points have been collected per patient during the month of monitoring. Four patients were re-admitted: reasons for admission are pulmonary embolism (1), infection (2) and stent problems (1) respectively. Prior to each re-admission, the model constructed around these physiological measures was able to predict re-admission > 48 hours prior to patient-initiated visit to hospital accident and emergency department, except for the patient with stent problems. The patient with stent symptoms was identified due to reduction in their daily questionnaire score. CONCLUSIONS: Remote monitoring is feasible, and patients can engage with it with minimal effort all while generating a large amount of data that is relevant to their recovery. In this small study, we show that it is possible to detect physiological disturbances before patients feel unwell enough to be re-admitted to hospital. It would be informative to design an intervention to triage these patients earlier in an effort to reduce total re-admission days.

N2  - Joint angle quantification from inertial measurement units (IMUs) is commonly performed using kinematic modelling, which depends on anatomical sensor placement and/or functional joint calibration; however, accurate three-dimensional joint motion measurement remains challenging to achieve. The aims of this study were firstly to employ deep neural networks to convert IMU data to ankle joint angles that are indistinguishable from those derived from motion capture-based inverse kinematics (IK) - the reference standard; and secondly, to validate the robustness of this approach across contrasting walking speeds in healthy individuals. Kinematics data were simultaneously calculated using IMUs and IK from 9 subjects during walking on a treadmill at 0.5 m/s, 1.0 m/s and 1.5 m/s. A generative adversarial network was trained using gait data at two of the walking speeds to predict ankle kinematics from IMU data alone for the third walking speed. There were significant differences between IK and IMU joint angle predictions for ankle eversion and internal rotation during walking at 0.5 m/s and 1.0 m/s (p < 0.001); however, no significant differences in joint angles were observed between the generative adversarial network prediction and IK at any speed or plane of joint motion (p < 0.05). The RMS difference in ankle joint kinematics between the generative adversarial network and IK for walking at 1.0 m/s was 3.8°, 2.1° and 3.5° for dorsiflexion, inversion and axial rotation, respectively. The modeling approach presented for real-time IMU to ankle joint angle conversion, which can be readily expanded to other joints, may provide enhanced IMU capability in applications such as telemedicine, remote monitoring and rehabilitation.

N2  - Remote monitoring of physical frailty is important to personalize care for slowing down the frailty process and/or for the healthy recovery of older adults following acute or chronic stressors. Taking the Fried frailty criteria as a reference to determine physical frailty and frailty phenotypes (slowness, weakness, exhaustion, inactivity), this study aimed to explore the benefit of machine learning to determine the least number of digital biomarkers of physical frailty measurable from a pendant sensor during activities of daily living. Two hundred and fifty-nine older adults were classified into robust or pre-frail/frail groups based on the physical frailty assessments by the Fried frailty criteria. All participants wore a pendant sensor at the sternum level for 48 h. Of seventeen sensor-derived features extracted from a pendant sensor, fourteen significant features were used for machine learning based on logistic regression modeling and a recursive feature elimination technique incorporating bootstrapping. The combination of percentage time standing, percentage time walking, walking cadence, and longest walking bout were identified as optimal digital biomarkers of physical frailty and frailty phenotypes. These findings suggest that a combination of sensor-measured exhaustion, inactivity, and speed have potential to screen and monitor people for physical frailty and frailty phenotypes.

N2  - It is a major challenge in clinical epilepsy to diagnose and treat a disease characterized by infrequent seizures based on patient or caregiver reports and limited duration clinical testing. The poor reliability of self-reported seizure diaries for many people with epilepsy is well-established, but these records remain necessary in clinical care and therapeutic studies. A number of wearable devices have emerged, which may be capable of detecting seizures, recording seizure data, and alerting caregivers. Developments in non-invasive wearable sensors to measure accelerometry, photoplethysmography (PPG), electrodermal activity (EDA), electromyography (EMG), and other signals outside of the traditional clinical environment may be able to identify seizure-related changes. Non-invasive scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and minimally invasive subscalp EEG may allow direct measurement of seizure activity. However, significant network and computational infrastructure is needed for continuous, secure transmission of data. The large volume of data acquired by these devices necessitates computer-assisted review and detection to reduce the burden on human reviewers. Furthermore, user acceptability of such devices must be a paramount consideration to ensure adherence with long-term device use. Such devices can identify tonic–clonic seizures, but identification of other seizure semiologies with non-EEG wearables is an ongoing challenge. Identification of electrographic seizures with subscalp EEG systems has recently been demonstrated over long (>6 month) durations, and this shows promise for accurate, objective seizure records. While the ability to detect and forecast seizures from ambulatory intracranial EEG is established, invasive devices may not be acceptable for many individuals with epilepsy. Recent studies show promising results for probabilistic forecasts of seizure risk from long-term wearable devices and electronic diaries of self-reported seizures. There may also be predictive value in individuals' symptoms, mood, and cognitive performance. However, seizure forecasting requires perpetual use of a device for monitoring, increasing the importance of the system's acceptability to users. Furthermore, long-term studies with concurrent EEG confirmation are lacking currently. This review describes the current evidence and challenges in the use of minimally and non-invasive devices for long-term epilepsy monitoring, the essential components in remote monitoring systems, and explores the feasibility to detect and forecast impending seizures via long-term use of these systems.

N2  - Flexible, breathable, and degradable pressure sensors with excellent sensing performance are drawing tremendous attention for various practical applications in wearable artificial skins, healthcare monitoring, and artificial intelligence due to their flexibility, breathability, lightweight, decreased electronic rubbish, and environmentally friendly impact. However, traditional plastic or elastomer substrates with impermeability, uncomfortableness, mechanical mismatches, and nondegradability greatly restricted their practical applications. Therefore, the fabrication of such pressure sensors with high flexibility, facile degradability, and breathability is still a critical challenge and highly desired. Herein, we present a wearable, breathable, degradable, and highly sensitive MXene/protein nanocomposites-based pressure sensor. The fabricated MXene/protein-based pressure sensor is assembled from a breathable conductive MXene coated silk fibroin nanofiber (MXene-SF) membrane and a silk fibroin nanofiber membrane patterned with a MXene ink-printed (MXene ink-SF) interdigitated electrode, which can serve as the sensing layer and the electrode layer, respectively. The assembled pressure sensor exhibits a wide sensing range (up to 39.3 kPa), high sensitivity (298.4 kPa-1 for 1.4-15.7 kPa; 171.9 kPa-1 for 15.7-39.3 kPa), fast response/recovery time (7/16 ms), reliable breathability, excellent cycling stability over 10 000 cycles, good biocompatibility, and robust degradability. Furthermore, it shows great sensing performance in monitoring human psychological signals, acting as an artificial skin for the quantitative illustration of pressure distribution, and wireless biomonitoring in real time. Considering the biodegradable and breathable features, the sensor may become promising to find potential applications in smart electronic skins, human motion detection, disease diagnosis, and human-machine interaction.

N2  - Introduction Diabetes prevalence continues to grow and there remains a significant diagnostic gap in one-third of the US population that has pre-diabetes. Innovative, practical strategies to improve monitoring of glycemic health are desperately needed. In this proof-of-concept study, we explore the relationship between non-invasive wearables and glycemic metrics and demonstrate the feasibility of using non-invasive wearables to estimate glycemic metrics, including hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and glucose variability metrics. Research design and methods We recorded over 25 000 measurements from a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) with simultaneous wrist-worn wearable (skin temperature, electrodermal activity, heart rate, and accelerometry sensors) data over 8-10 days in 16 participants with normal glycemic state and pre-diabetes (HbA1c 5.2-6.4). We used data from the wearable to develop machine learning models to predict HbA1c recorded on day 0 and glucose variability calculated from the CGM. We tested the accuracy of the HbA1c model on a retrospective, external validation cohort of 10 additional participants and compared results against CGM-based HbA1c estimation models. Results A total of 250 days of data from 26 participants were collected. Out of the 27 models of glucose variability metrics that we developed using non-invasive wearables, 11 of the models achieved high accuracy (<10% mean average per cent error, MAPE). Our HbA1c estimation model using non-invasive wearables data achieved MAPE of 5.1% on an external validation cohort. The ranking of wearable sensor's importance in estimating HbA1c was skin temperature (33%), electrodermal activity (28%), accelerometry (25%), and heart rate (14%). Conclusions This study demonstrates the feasibility of using non-invasive wearables to estimate glucose variability metrics and HbA1c for glycemic monitoring and investigates the relationship between non-invasive wearables and the glycemic metrics of glucose variability and HbA1c. The methods used in this study can be used to inform future studies confirming the results of this proof-of-concept study.

N2  - Arterial hypertension (HT) is a chronic condition of elevated blood pressure (BP), which may cause increased incidence of cardiovascular disease, stroke, kidney failure and mortality. If the HT is diagnosed early, effective treatment can control the BP and avert adverse outcomes. Physiological signals like electrocardiography (ECG), photoplethysmography (PPG), heart rate variability (HRV), and ballistocardiography (BCG) can be used to monitor health status but are not directly correlated with BP measurements. The manual detection of HT using these physiological signals is time consuming and prone to human errors. Hence, many computer-aided diagnosis systems have been developed. This paper is a systematic review of studies conducted on the automated detection of HT using ECG, HRV, PPG and BCG signals. In this review, we have identified 23 studies out of 250 screened papers, which fulfilled our eligibility criteria. Details of the study methods, physiological signal studied, database used, various nonlinear techniques employed, feature extraction, and diagnostic performance parameters are discussed. The machine learning and deep learning based methods based on ECG and HRV signals have yielded the best performance and can be used for the development of computer-aided diagnosis of HT. This work provides insights that may be useful for the development of wearable for continuous cuffless remote monitoring of BP based on ECG and HRV signals.

N2  - Rationale, aims and objectives: Artificial intelligence and big data are more and more used in medicine, either in prevention, diagnosis or treatment, and are clearly modifying the way medicine is thought and practiced. Some authors argue that the use of artificial intelligence techniques to analyze big data would even constitute a scientific revolution, in medicine as much as in other scientific disciplines. Moreover, artificial intelligence techniques, coupled with mobile health technologies, could furnish a personalized medicine, adapted to the individuality of each patient. In this paper we argue that this conception is largely a myth: what health professionals and patients need is not more data, but data that are critically appraised, especially to avoid bias. Methods: In this historical and conceptual article, we focus on two main problems: first, the data and the problem of its validity; second, the inference drawn from the data by AI, and the establishment of correlations through the use of algorithms. We use examples from the contemporary use of mobile health (mHealth), i.e. the practice of medicine and public health supported by mobile or wearable devices such as mobile phones or smart watches. Results: We show that the validity of the data and of the inferences drawn from these mHealth data are likely to be biased. As biases are insensitive to the size of the sample, even if the sample is the whole population, artificial intelligence and big data cannot avoid biases and even tend to increase them. Conclusions: The large amount of data thus appears rather as a problem than a solution. What contemporary medicine needs is not more data or more algorithms, but a critical appraisal of the data and of the analysis of the data. Considering the history of epidemiology, we propose three research priorities concerning the use of artificial intelligence and big data in medicine.

N2  - Diabetes is a metabolic disease that affects millions of people each year. It is associated with an increased likelihood of vital organ failures and decreased quality of life. Early detection and regular monitoring are crucial for managing diabetes. Remote patient monitoring can facilitate effective intervention and treatment paradigms using current technology. This work proposes an end-to-end remote monitoring framework for automated diabetes risk prediction and management, using personal health devices, smart wearables and smartphones. A support vector machine was developed for diabetes risk prediction using the Pima Indian Diabetes Database, after feature scaling, imputation, selection and augmentation. This work achieved the performance metrics of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity scores at 83.20%, 87.20% and 79% respectively through the tenfold stratified cross validation method, which is competitive with existing methods. Patients can use multiple healthcare devices, smartphones and smartwatches to measure vital parameters, curb the progression of diabetes and close the communication loop with medical professionals. The proposed framework enables medical professionals to make informed decisions based on the latest diabetes risk predictions and lifestyle insights while attaining unobtrusiveness, reduced cost, and vendor interoperability.

N2  - Introduction & Objectives: Radical cystectomy (RC) has 30-day and 90-day re-admission rates of over 15% and 20% respectively. The majority of complications are infection and bowel-related. Modern wearable devices and Bluetooth-enabled devices can measure and transmit data directly to a mobile phone, which can then upload this data to a web server in real-time for remote monitoring. In this study, we test the feasibility of remote monitoring for 30 days in patients discharged from hospital following RC. Materials & Methods: As part of the DREAMPath (ISRCTN62293620) study, patients were provided with an iPhone, Apple Watch Series 4 and three Bluetooth peripherals (sphygmomanometer, pulse oximeter, thermometer). They were instructed to wear the Apple Watch at all times, and measure their observations twice a day. Additionally, patients were asked to complete a quality of recovery 15 questionnaire daily. At the end of 30 days, re-admission data was collected. Machine learning algorithms were applied to this data to test their value in predicting hospital admission. Results: 30 patients have been recruited into the study so far. At the time of our interim analysis, 5,687 data points were collected per patient during the month of monitoring. Four patients were re-admitted due to pulmonary embolism (1), infection (2) and stent problems (1) respectively. Physiological measures alone were able to predict re-admission > 48 hours prior to patient-initiated visit to hospital accident and emergency department. No false positives or false negatives were identifed using pre-determined cutoffs. Data from the wearable devices alone were able to detect all readmission events using machine learning algorithms. Conclusions: Remote monitoring is feasible, and patients can engage with it with minimal effort all while generating large amount of data that is relevant to their recovery. In this small study, we show that it is possible to detect physiological disturbances before patients feel unwell enough to be admitted to hospital. It would be informative to design an intervention to triage these patients earlier in an effort to reduce total re-admission days.

N2  - Objective: We developed a wearable watch-based device to provide noninvasive, cuff-less blood pressure (BP) estimation in an at-home setting. Methods: The watch measures single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), tri-axial seismocardiogram (SCG), and multi-wavelength photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals to compute the pulse transit time (PTT), allowing for BP estimation. We sent our custom watch device and an oscillometric BP cuff home with 21 healthy subjects, and captured the natural variability in BP over the course of a 24-hour period. Results: After calibration, our Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.69 and root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of 2.72 mmHg suggest that noninvasive PTT measurements correlate with around-the-clock BP. Using a novel two-point calibration method, we achieved a RMSE of 3.86 mmHg. We further demonstrated the potential of a semi-globalized adaptive model to reduce calibration requirements. Conclusion: This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first time that BP has been comprehensively estimated noninvasively using PTT in an at-home setting. We showed a more convenient method for obtaining ambulatory BP than through the use of the standard oscillometric cuff. We presented new calibration methods for BP estimation using fewer calibration points that are more practical for a real-world scenario. Significance: A custom watch (SeismoWatch) capable of taking multiple BP measurements enables reliable remote monitoring of daily BP and paves the way towards convenient hypertension screening and management, which can potentially reduce hospitalizations and improve quality of life.

N2  - The application of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques in the medical world is growing, with a range of purposes: from the identification and prediction of possible diseases to patient monitoring and clinical decision support systems. Furthermore, the widespread use of remote monitoring medical devices, under the umbrella of the "Internet of Medical Things" (IoMT), has simplified the retrieval of patient information as they allow continuous monitoring and direct access to data by healthcare providers. However, due to possible issues in real-world settings, such as loss of connectivity, irregular use, misuse, or poor adherence to a monitoring program, the data collected might not be sufficient to implement accurate algorithms. For this reason, data augmentation techniques can be used to create synthetic datasets sufficiently large to train machine learning models. In this work, we apply the concept of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to perform a data augmentation from patient data obtained through IoMT sensors for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) monitoring. We also apply an explainable AI algorithm to demonstrate the accuracy of the synthetic data by comparing it to the real data recorded by the sensors. The results obtained demonstrate how synthetic datasets created through a well-structured GAN are comparable with a real dataset, as validated by a novel approach based on machine learning.

N2  - Tremendous scientific and technological achievements have been revolutionizing the current medical era, changing the way in which physicians practice their profession and deliver healthcare provisions. This is due to the convergence of various advancements related to digitalization and the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs)—ranging from the internet of things (IoT) and the internet of medical things (IoMT) to the fields of robotics, virtual and augmented reality, and massively parallel and cloud computing. Further progress has been made in the fields of addictive manufacturing and three-dimensional (3D) printing, sophisticated statistical tools such as big data visualization and analytics (BDVA) and artificial intelligence (AI), the use of mobile and smartphone applications (apps), remote monitoring and wearable sensors, and e-learning, among others. Within this new conceptual framework, big data represents a massive set of data characterized by different properties and features. These can be categorized both from a quantitative and qualitative standpoint, and include data generated from wet-lab and microarrays (molecular big data), databases and registries (clinical/computational big data), imaging techniques (such as radiomics, imaging big data) and web searches (the so-called infodemiology, digital big data). The present review aims to show how big and smart data can revolutionize gynecology by shedding light on female reproductive health, both in terms of physiology and pathophysiology. More specifically, they appear to have potential uses in the field of gynecology to increase its accuracy and precision, stratify patients, provide opportunities for personalized treatment options rather than delivering a package of “one-size-fits-it-all” healthcare management provisions, and enhance its effectiveness at each stage (health promotion, prevention, diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutics).

N2  - Chronic diseases are becoming more widespread. Treatment and monitoring of these diseases require going to hospitals frequently, which increases the burdens of hospitals and patients. Presently, advancements in wearable sensors and communication protocol contribute to enriching the healthcare system in a way that will reshape healthcare services shortly. Remote patient monitoring (RPM) is the foremost of these advancements. RPM systems are based on the collection of patient vital signs extracted using invasive and noninvasive techniques, then sending them in real-time to physicians. These data may help physicians in taking the right decision at the right time. The main objective of this paper is to outline research directions on remote patient monitoring, explain the role of AI in building RPM systems, make an overview of the state of the art of RPM, its advantages, its challenges, and its probable future directions. For studying the literature, five databases have been chosen (i.e., science direct, IEEE-Explore, Springer, PubMed, and science.gov). We followed the (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) PRISMA, which is a standard methodology for systematic reviews and meta-analyses. A total of 56 articles are reviewed based on the combination of a set of selected search terms including RPM, data mining, clinical decision support system, electronic health record, cloud computing, internet of things, and wireless body area network. The result of this study approved the effectiveness of RPM in improving healthcare delivery, increase diagnosis speed, and reduce costs. To this end, we also present the chronic disease monitoring system as a case study to provide enhanced solutions for RPMs.

N2  - Background and Objectives: Post-discharge oncologic surgical complications are costly for patients, families, and healthcare systems. The capacity to predict complications and early intervention can improve postoperative outcomes. In this proof-of-concept study, we used a machine learning approach to explore the potential added value of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and patient-generated health data (PGHD) in predicting post-discharge complications for gastrointestinal (GI) and lung cancer surgery patients. Methods: We formulated post-discharge complication prediction as a binary classification task. Features were extracted from clinical variables, PROs (MD Anderson Symptom Inventory [MDASI]), and PGHD (VivoFit) from a cohort of 52 patients with 134 temporal observation points pre- and post-discharge that were collected from two pilot studies. We trained and evaluated supervised learning classifiers via nested cross-validation. Results: A logistic regression model with L2 regularization trained with clinical data, PROs and PGHD from wearable pedometers achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic of 0.74. Conclusions: PROs and PGHDs captured through remote patient telemonitoring approaches have the potential to improve prediction performance for postoperative complications.

N2  - Because of the rapid and serious nature of acute cardiovascular disease (CVD) especially ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), a leading cause of death worldwide, prompt diagnosis and treatment is of crucial importance to reduce both mortality and morbidity. During a pandemic such as coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), it is critical to balance cardiovascular emergencies with infectious risk. In this work, we recommend using wearable device based mobile health (mHealth) as an early screening and real-Time monitoring tool to address this balance and facilitate remote monitoring to tackle this unprecedented challenge. This recommendation may help to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of acute CVD patient management while reducing infection risk.

N2  - Introduction: Smart healthcare monitoring allows detecting health conditions using Big Data, namely aggregated data concerning physiological and behavioral parameters. The continuous collection of data from smart-devices performed by the Ecological Momentary Assessment approach represents a promising application of BigData. Objectives: This preliminary study was aimed at developing a research protocol focused on the use of Big Data in evaluating the impact of urban environment, affected by a variety of potentially damaging anthropogenic actions, on illness relapses in Bipolar Disorders (BD). Methods: This pilot study was designed by researchers fromDepartments of Psychiatry and Engineering (CIRIAF), University of Perugia. Environmental, physiological, and behavioral parameters and smart-devices aimed at collecting Big Data were identified. Subjects aged 18-65, affected by BD in current euthymic state referring to the University/General Hospital of Perugia will be recruited. Results: Subjects will undergo a baseline visit and three monitoring visits during one year. Wearable devices will be provided for collecting data about environmental and physiological parameters. Behavioral data will be collected through smartphone accelerometers, GPS, and overall smartphone use. Big data will be stored into an online platform that will provide real-time feedback concerning the recorded variables. Clinical information concerning BD relapses will be collected. Machine learning techniques, integrated to deterministic analysis of urban environmental conditions, will be used to create possible predictive models for BD relapses. Conclusions: The present project could allow the creation of a new operative platform for a better health management system correlating real-time Big Data to specific clinical features of BD.

N2  - Wearable sensors have evolved from body-worn fitness tracking devices to multifunctional, highly integrated, compact, and versatile sensors, which can be mounted onto the desired locations of our clothes or body to continuously monitor our body signals, and better interact and communicate with our surrounding environment or equipment. Here, we discuss the latest advances in textile-based and skin-like wearable sensors with a focus on three areas, including (i) personalised health monitoring to facilitate recording physiological signals, body motions, and analysis of body fluids, (ii) smart gloves and prosthetics to realise the sensation of touch and pain, and (iii) assistive technologies to enable disabled people to operate the surrounding motorised equipment using their active organs. We also discuss areas for future research in this emerging field.

N2  - Falls are one of the leading causes of permanent injury and/or disability among the elderly. When these people live alone, it is convenient that a caregiver or family member visits them periodically. However, these visits do not prevent falls when the elderly person is alone. Furthermore, in exceptional circumstances, such as a pandemic, we must avoid unnecessary mobility. This is why remote monitoring systems are currently on the rise, and several commercial solutions can be found. However, current solutions use devices attached to the waist or wrist, causing discomfort in the people who wear them. The users also tend to forget to wear the devices carried in these positions. Therefore, in order to prevent these problems, the main objective of this work is designing and recollecting a new dataset about falls, falling risks and activities of daily living using an ankle-placed device obtaining a good balance between the different activity types. This dataset will be a useful tool for researchers who want to integrate the fall detector in the footwear. Thus, in this work we design the fall-detection device, study the suitable activities to be collected, collect the dataset from 21 users performing the studied activities and evaluate the quality of the collected dataset. As an additional and secondary study, we implement a simple Deep Learning classifier based on this data to prove the system's feasibility.

N2  - Wearable electronic textiles are used in sensors, energy-harvesting devices, healthcare monitoring, human-machine interfaces, and soft robotics to acquire real-time big data for machine learning and artificial intelligence. Wearability is essential while collecting data from a human, who should be able to wear the device with sufficient comfort. In this study, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and silver nanowires (AgNWs) were supersonically sprayed onto a fabric to ensure good adhesiveness, resulting in a washable, stretchable, and wearable fabric without affecting the performance of the designed features. This rGO/AgNW-decorated fabric can be used to monitor external stimuli such as strain and temperature. In addition, it is used as a heater and as a supercapacitor and features an antibacterial hydrophobic surface that minimizes potential infection from external airborne viruses or virus-containing droplets. Herein, the wearability, stretchability, washability, mechanical durability, temperature-sensing capability, heating ability, wettability, and antibacterial features of this metallized fabric are explored. This multifunctionality is achieved in a single fabric coated with rGO/AgNWs via supersonic spraying.

N2  - Background: Pancreatic cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths, and although pancreatectomy is currently the only curative treatment, it is associated with significant morbidity. Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the utility of wearable telemonitoring technologies to predict treatment outcomes using patient activity metrics and machine learning. Methods: In this prospective, single-center, single-cohort study, patients scheduled for pancreatectomy were provided with a wearable telemonitoring device to be worn prior to surgery. Patient clinical data were collected and all patients were evaluated using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program surgical risk calculator (ACS-NSQIP SRC). Machine learning models were developed to predict whether patients would have a textbook outcome and compared with the ACS-NSQIP SRC using area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves. Results: Between February 2019 and February 2020, 48 patients completed the study. Patient activity metrics were collected over an average of 27.8 days before surgery. Patients took an average of 4162.1 (SD 4052.6) steps per day and had an average heart rate of 75.6 (SD 14.8) beats per minute. Twenty-eight (58%) patients had a textbook outcome after pancreatectomy. The group of 20 (42%) patients who did not have a textbook outcome included 14 patients with severe complications and 11 patients requiring readmission. The ACS-NSQIP SRC had an AUROC curve of 0.6333 to predict failure to achieve a textbook outcome, while our model combining patient clinical characteristics and patient activity data achieved the highest performance with an AUROC curve of 0.7875. Conclusions: Machine learning models outperformed ACS-NSQIP SRC estimates in predicting textbook outcomes after pancreatectomy. The highest performance was observed when machine learning models incorporated patient clinical characteristics and activity metrics.

N2  - Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 may deteriorate rapidly and therefore continuous monitoring is necessary. We conducted an observational study involving patients with mild COVID-19 to explore the potentials of wearable biosensors and machine learning-based analysis of physiology parameters to detect clinical deterioration. Thirty-four patients (median age: 32 years; male: 52.9%) with mild COVID-19 from Queen Mary Hospital were recruited. The mean National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) were 0.59 ± 0.7. 1231 manual measurement of physiology parameters were performed during hospital stay (median 15 days). Physiology parameters obtained from wearable biosensors correlated well with manual measurement including pulse rate (r = 0.96, p < 0.0001) and oxygen saturation (r = 0.87, p < 0.0001). A machine learning-derived index reflecting overall health status, Biovitals Index (BI), was generated by autonomous analysis of physiology parameters, symptoms, and other medical data. Daily BI was linearly associated with respiratory tract viral load (p < 0.0001) and NEWS2 (r = 0.75, p < 0.001). BI was superior to NEWS2 in predicting clinical worsening events (sensitivity 94.1% and specificity 88.9%) and prolonged hospitalization (sensitivity 66.7% and specificity 72.7%). Wearable biosensors coupled with machine learning-derived health index allowed automated detection of clinical deterioration.

N2  - Textile wastewater contains large quantities of azo dyes mixed with various contaminants especially heavy metal ions. The discharge of effluents containing methyl orange (MO) dye and Cu2+ ions into water is harmful because they have severe toxic effects to humans and the aquatic ecosystem. The dried algal biomass was used as a sustainable, cost-effective and eco-friendly for the treatment of the textile wastewater. Box-Behnken design (BBD) was used to identify the most significant factors for achieving maximum biosorption of Cu2+ and MO from aqueous solutions using marine alga Fucus vesiculosus biomass. The experimental results indicated that 3 g/L of F. vesiculosus biomass was capable of removing 92.76% of copper and 50.27% of MO simultaneously from aqueous solution using MO (60 mg/L), copper (200 mg/L) at pH 7 within 60 min with agitation at 200 rpm. The dry biomass was also investigated using SEM, EDS, and FTIR before and after MO and copper biosorption. FTIR, EDS and SEM analyses revealed obvious changes in the characteristics of the algal biomass as a result of the biosorption process. The dry biomass of F. vesiculosus can eliminate MO and copper ions from aquatic effluents in a feasible and efficient method.

N2  - With the explosive development of smart wearable devices, a serious situation that a large amount of energy waste and environmental pollution caused by electronic discarding needs to be solved urgently. Here, as a throwaway waste material, a chewed gum can be reused for the preparation of wearable iontronics simply. A new gum sensor was constructed by regularly stretching a chewed gum in 6 M NaCl aqueous or even a Chinese edible salt solution for increasing the ionic conductivity. This gum sensor can be shaped arbitrarily, and the preparation process is green, pollution-free, with low energy consumption, and repeatable. Herein, this gum sensor can be utilized for real-time human healthcare monitoring effectively (i.e., facial mood changes, finger flexion, long time walking, and continuous ankle movement) and shows a fast response time of 297 ms and a reliable cycling performance in monitoring body motions. Furthermore, the gum sensor (containing edible salt) can act as a signal transmitter for intelligent information encryption and transmission in the light of the international Morse code with excellent repeatability and stability. Hence, this work will greatly possess wide potential application prospects in wearable electronics and information encryption. This gum sensor also provides a ponderable option in the next generation of artificial intelligence devices, which can address the troubles of material selections in sensor preparation.

N2  - Rationale: Artificial intelligence has become an increasingly valuable tool for analyzing large datasets. As algorithms are trained to supplement clinical diagnoses, utilizing representative populations is crucial to ensure that racially diverse communities would benefit to the same degree as the overall population. Methods: Utilizing PRISMA guidelines, a literature search was conducted using the search terms “asthma” and “artificial intelligence.” PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, Embase, and Cochrane were utilized in this scoping review. Inclusion criteria consisted of articles published after 2015, written in English, and excluded review papers and abstracts. Results: The search criteria resulted in a total of 390 articles. A preliminary review was conducted based on inclusion criteria, thereby resulting in 55 articles. Relevant articles were subcategorized based on diagnosis (23.6%), endotypes (32.7%), triage/risk assessment (14.5%), Natural Language Processing (NLP)/big data (12.7%), and wearables/telemonitoring (16.5%). A secondary review was performed to identify the patient populations that were used to train AI software. Only ten articles (18.2%) included sociodemographic information of the patient population and considered this as a factor in determining training cohorts. Six (10.9%) articles used environmental factors such as weather and pollutants as risk factors. Conclusions: Existing literature on machine learning and asthma often fails to thoroughly characterize the participants in their training populations. Specifically, patients within our network at Montefiore face unique environmental and socioeconomic challenges that are not reflected in the literature. This indicates a need to address the socioeconomic and environmental disparities in big data practices for characterizing asthma and its related triggers.

N2  - Purpose: To propose a deep-learning-based approach to automatically and objectively evaluate morphologic eyelid features using two-dimensional(2D) digital photographs and to assess the agreement between automatic and manual measurements. Materials and Methods: The 2D photographs of 1378 normal Asian participants (2756 eyes) were included for training, validating and testing the cornea and eyelid segmentation network. Margin reflex distance 1 (MRD1) and margin reflex distance 2 (MRD2) of 406 eyes from 203 participants were manually evaluated by 3 ophthalmologists and the photographs of 406 eyes were measured automatically for 8 morphologic eyelid features. The Spearman’s correlation coefficient, intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland-Altman analyses were used to determine the agreement between manual and automatic MRDs. Results: The dice coefficient was 0.922 and 0.974 for eyelid and cornea segmentation, respectively. A strong correlation was shown between manually and automatically measured MRD1 (r = 0.993, ICC = 0.996) and MRD2 (r = 0.950, ICC = 0.974). Bland-Altman analyses also showed excellent reliability with bias being 0.04 mmbetween automated and manual MRD1 measurements and 0.06 mm for MRD2. Automatically measured 8 features (MRD1, MRD2, palpebral fissure, medial area, lateral area, cornea area, upper and lower eyelid lengths) were found to be increased with age and peaked around the age range of 21 to 30 years. Conclusions: The proposed novel integrative analysis scheme was comparable with human performance. The approach with excellent reliability and reproductivity showed great potential for automated diagnosis and remote monitoring of eyelid-related diseases.

N2  - Introduction: The aim of the present review is to track the evolution of wearable IMUs from their use in supervised laboratory- and ambulatory-based settings to their application for long-term monitoring of human movement in unsupervised naturalistic settings. Areas covered: Four main emerging areas of application were identified and synthesized, namely, mobile health solutions (specifically, for the assessment of frailty, risk of falls, chronic neurological diseases, and for the monitoring and promotion of active living), occupational ergonomics, rehabilitation and telerehabilitation, and cognitive assessment. Findings from recent scientific literature in each of these areas was synthesized from an applied and/or clinical perspective with the purpose of providing clinical researchers and practitioners with practical guidance on contemporary uses of inertial sensors in applied clinical settings. Expert Opinion: IMU-based wearable devices have undergone a rapid transition from use in laboratory-based clinical practice to unsupervised, applied settings. Successful use of wearable inertial sensing for assessing mobility, motor performance and movement disorders in applied settings will rely also on machine learning algorithms for managing the vast amounts of data generated by these sensors for extracting information that is both clinically relevant and interpretable by practitioners.

N2  - Objective: To explore the effectiveness of cardiac remote monitoring system (CRMS) based on artificial intelligence-enabled ECG algorithm mode for evaluating asymptomatic myocardial ischemia (AMI) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Methods: Two hundred CAD patients confirmed by coronary angiography (CA) in our hospital were included as the study subjects, 120 of whom developed myocardial ischemia (MI). All patients received 12-lead telephone remote ECG monitoring and evaluation. After monitoring, artificial intelligence-enabled ECG algorithm was performed to observe the detection rate of MI. Results: Compared with artificial intelligence-enabled ECG algorithm combined with remote ECG monitoring system, the detection rate of remote ECG monitoring system in 120 MI patients was lower (96.67% vs. 86.67%, P<0.01). Among the 120 MI patients, there were 26 patients (21.67%) with symptomatic myocardial ischemia (SMI) and 94 patients (78.33%) with AMI. There was no difference between the two detection methods in the diagnosis of SMI (P>0.05), while there was a difference in the diagnosis of AMI (P<0.01). The degree and duration of ST segment decline and the threshold variability of MI were higher in SMI patients than those in AMI patients (P<0.001). It showed that the lowest frequency of MI was from 0:00 to 06:00, and the highest from 06:01 to 12:00, with significant difference compared with other time periods (P<0.05). Conclusion: The CRMS based on artificial intelligence-enabled ECG algorithm mode can significantly improve the detection rate of AMI. Moreover, small changes of ST segment in AMI patients and circadian rhythm of disease onset were presented.

N2  - The COVID-19 global pandemic has had striking effects on clinical practice and medical assistance and the progressive evolution of telemedicine and telehealth systems has allowed healthcare professionals to connect with patients yet respecting the striking need for social distancing. This article aims to review the possible ways to use telehealth and teleconsulting systems to guarantee an adequate level of clinical assistance starting from screening procedures up to support the management of patients admitted to intensive care units area, thus balancing the need to ensure continuity of care and at the same time limiting the possible sources of contagion expansion. Telemedicine may be a useful tool to improve clinical assistance and reduce the financial burden on the health system in a long-term view. Although it cannot completely replace patient-physician interactions, it would be desirable to implement this field and made it accessible to the largest part of the population.

N2  - Telemedicine has gained immense momentum in heart failure, not least as a result of the Corona pandemic. In symptomatic patients the use of telemonitoring is associated with a reduction in hospital admissions and mortality as well as an improvement in quality of life. Data is acquired either via non-invasive as well as invasive sensors. In the future, in addition to innovations in sensor technology, we can expect to see the use of wearables, complex predictive algorithms that combine a variety of information, and self-learning artificial intelligence. However, a prerequisite for the widespread application of telemedicine in routine clinical practice is the availability of adequate funding.

N2  - Digital technologies are transforming society and our way of life. The Covid- 19 emergency has further accelerated this transformation, making available remote services that have replaced those we used to use in presence. This transformation has given a further boost to digital health. Many services for telemedicine in all its forms (remote televisit, telehealth, telerehabilitation, telemonitoring) are now available and in some cases can be prescribed and reimbursed by national health systems or insurance companies. Apps and wearables are increasingly used to collect health data and can help promote healthy lifestyles, disseminate information for the prevention and management of certain diseases, involve the patient in treatment, and improve adherence to therapy and doctor-patient communication. Digital therapeutics, providing software that modify lifestyles and deliver cognitive-behavioural interventions, offer therapeutic interventions based on solid scientific evidence to prevent, manage, or treat a wide range of physical, mental and behavioural conditions. Artificial intelligence and machine learning systems help to analyse and interpret data produced in the medical field to create diagnostic and predictive systems, systems for defining the best treatment to administer to a patient, and systems for identifying new drugs. It is essential, however, that digital health tools be rigorously tested and regulated before widespread adoption, as is the case with normal medical devices and drug therapies.

N2  - The increasing popularity of wearable consumer products can play a significant role in the healthcare sector. The recognition of human activities from IoT is an important building block in this context. While the analysis of the generated datastream can have many benefits from a health point of view, it can also lead to privacy threats by exposing highly sensitive information. In this article, we propose a framework that relies on machine learning to efficiently recognise the user activity, useful for personal healthcare monitoring, while limiting the risk of users re-identification from biometric patterns characterizing each individual. To achieve that, we show that features in temporal domain are useful to discriminate user activity while features in frequency domain lead to distinguish the user identity. We then design a novel protection mechanism processing the raw signal on the user's smartphone to select relevant features for activity recognition and normalise features sensitive to re-identification. These unlinkable features are then transferred to the application server. We extensively evaluate our framework with reference datasets: Results show an accurate activity recognition (87%) while limiting the re-identification rate (33%). This represents a slight decrease of utility (9%) against a large privacy improvement (53%) compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

N2  - Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) systems are envisioned to provide high-quality healthcare services to patients in the comfort of their home, utilizing cutting-edge Internet of Things (IoT) technologies and medical sensors. Patient comfort and willingness to participate in such efforts is a prominent factor for their adoption. As IoT technology has provided solutions for all technical issues, patient concerns are those that seem to restrict their wider adoption. To enhance patient awareness of the system properties and enhance their willingness to adopt IoMT solutions, this paper presents a novel methodology to integrate patient concerns in the design requirements of such systems. It comprises a number of straightforward steps that an IoMT designer can follow, starting from identifying patient concerns, incorporating them in system design requirements as criticalities, proceeding to system implementation and testing, and finally, verifying that it fulfills the concerns of the patients. To showcase the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, the paper applies it in the design and implementation of a fall detection system for elderly patients remotely monitored in their homes.

N2  - Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a fast-progressive neurodegenerative disease leading to progressive physical immobility with usually normal or mild cognitive and/or behavioural involvement. Many patients are relatively young, instructed, sensitive to new technologies, and professionally active when developing the first symptoms. Older patients usually require more time, encouragement, reinforcement and a closer support but, nevertheless, selecting user-friendly devices, provided earlier in the course of the disease, and engaging motivated carers may overcome many technological barriers. ALS may be considered a model for neurodegenerative diseases to further develop and test new technologies. From multidisciplinary teleconsults to telemonitoring of the respiratory function, telemedicine has the potentiality to embrace other fields, including nutrition, physical mobility, and the interaction with the environment. Brain-computer interfaces and eye tracking expanded the field of augmentative and alternative communication in ALS but their potentialities go beyond communication, to cognition and robotics. Virtual reality and different forms of artificial intelligence present further interesting possibilities that deserve to be investigated. COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented opportunity to speed up the development and implementation of new technologies in clinical practice, improving the daily living of both ALS patients and carers. The present work reviews the current technologies for ALS patients already in place or being under evaluation with published publications, prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

N2  - Current wearable sensors are fabricated with substrates, which limits the comfort, flexibility, stretchability, and induces interface mismatch. In addition, the substrate prevents the evaporation of sweat and is harmful to skin health. In this work, we have enabled the substrate-free laser scribed graphene (SFG) electronic skin (e-skin) with multifunctions. Compared with the e-skin with the substrate, the SFG has good gas permeability, low impedance, and flexibility. Only assisted using water, the SFG can be transferred to almost any objects including silicon and human skin and it can even be suspended. Many through-holes like stomas in leaf can be formed in the SFG, which make it breathable. After designing the pattern, the gauge factor (GF) of graphene electronic skin (GES) can be designed as the strain sensor. Physiological signals such as respiration, human motion, and electrocardiogram (ECG) can be detected. Moreover, the suspended SFG detect vibrations with high sensitivity. Due to the substrate-free structure, the impedance between SFG e-skin and the human body decreases greatly. Finally, an ECG detecting system has been designed based on the GES, which can monitor the body condition in real time. To analyze the ECG signals automatically, a convolutional neural network (CNN) was built and trained successfully. This work has high potential in the field of health telemonitoring.

N2  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is a system of wireless, interrelated, and connected digital devices that can collect, send, and store data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction. The IoT promises many benefits to streamlining and enhancing health care delivery to proactively predict health issues and diagnose, treat, and monitor patients both in and out of the hospital. Worldwide, government leaders and decision makers are implementing policies to deliver health care services using technology and more so in response to the novel COVID-19 pandemic. It is now becoming increasingly important to understand how established and emerging IoT technologies can support health systems to deliver safe and effective care. The aim of this viewpoint paper is to provide an overview of the current IoT technology in health care, outline how IoT devices are improving health service delivery, and outline how IoT technology can affect and disrupt global health care in the next decade. The potential of IoT-based health care is expanded upon to theorize how IoT can improve the accessibility of preventative public health services and transition our current secondary and tertiary health care to be a more proactive, continuous, and coordinated system. Finally, this paper will deal with the potential issues that IoT-based health care generates, barriers to market adoption from health care professionals and patients alike, confidence and acceptability, privacy and security, interoperability, standardization and remuneration, data storage, and control and ownership. Corresponding enablers of IoT in current health care will rely on policy support, cybersecurity-focused guidelines, careful strategic planning, and transparent policies within health care organizations. IoT-based health care has great potential to improve the efficiency of the health system and improve population health.

N2  - Estimation of muscle excitations from a reduced sensor array could greatly improve current techniques in remote patient monitoring. Such an approach could allow continuous monitoring of clinically relevant biomechanical variables that are ideal for personalizing rehabilitation. In this paper, we introduce the notion of a muscle synergy function which describes the synergistic relationship between a subset of muscles. We develop from first principles an approximation to their behavior using Gaussian process regression and demonstrate the utility of the technique for estimating the excitation time-series of leg muscles during normal walking for nine healthy subjects. Specifically, excitations for six muscles were estimated using surface electromyography (sEMG) data during a finite time interval (called the input window) from four different muscles (called the input muscles) with mean absolute error (MAE) less than 5.0% of the maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) and that accounts for 82-88% of the variance (VAF) in the true excitations. Further, these estimated excitations informed muscle activations with less than 4.0% MAE and 89-93% VAF. We also present a detailed analysis of a number of different modeling choices, including every possible combination of four-, three- and two-muscle input sets, the size and structure of the input window, and the stationarity of the Gaussian process covariance functions. Further, application specific modifications for future use are discussed. The proposed technique lays a foundation to explore the use of reduced wearable sensor arrays and muscle synergy functions for monitoring clinically relevant biomechanics during daily life.

N2  - eHealth is the use of modern information and communication technology (ICT) for trans-institutional healthcare purposes. Important subtopics of eHealth are health data sharing and telemedicine. Most of the clinical documentation to be shared is collected in patient records to support patient care. More sophisticated approaches to electronic patient records are trans-institutional or (inter-)national. Other aims for clinical documentation are quality management, reimbursement, legal issues, and medical research. Basic prerequisite for eHealth is interoperability, which can be divided into technical, semantic and process interoperability. There is a variety of international standards to support interoperability. Telemedicine is a subtopic of eHealth, which bridges spatial distance by using ICT for medical (inter-)actions. We distinguish telemedicine among healthcare professionals and telemedicine between health care professionals and patients. Both have a great potential to face the challenges of aging societies, the increasing number of chronically ill patients, multimorbidity and low number of physicians in remote areas. With ongoing digitalization more and more data are available digitally. Clinical documentation is an important source for big data analysis and artificial intelligence. The patient has an important role: Telemonitoring, wearable technologies, and smart home devices provide digital health data from daily life. These are high-quality data which can be used for medical decisions.

N2  - Background: Subtle abnormal motor signs are indications of serious neurological diseases. Although neurological deficits require fast initiation of treatment in a restricted time, it is difficult for nonspecialists to detect and objectively assess the symptoms. In the clinical environment, diagnoses and decisions are based on clinical grading methods, including the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score or the Medical Research Council (MRC) score, which have been used to measure motor weakness. Objective grading in various environments is necessitated for consistent agreement among patients, caregivers, paramedics, and medical staff to facilitate rapid diagnoses and dispatches to appropriate medical centers. Objective: In this study, we aimed to develop an autonomous grading system for stroke patients. We investigated the feasibility of our new system to assess motor weakness and grade NIHSS and MRC scores of 4 limbs, similar to the clinical examinations performed by medical staff. Methods: We implemented an automatic grading system composed of a measuring unit with wearable sensors and a grading unit with optimized machine learning. Inertial sensors were attached to measure subtle weaknesses caused by paralysis of upper and lower limbs. We collected 60 instances of data with kinematic features of motor disorders from neurological examination and demographic information of stroke patients with NIHSS 0 or 1 and MRC 7, 8, or 9 grades in a stroke unit. Training data with 240 instances were generated using a synthetic minority oversampling technique to complement the imbalanced number of data between classes and low number of training data. We trained 2 representative machine learning algorithms, an ensemble and a support vector machine (SVM), to implement auto-NIHSS and auto-MRC grading. The optimized algorithms performed a 5-fold cross-validation and were searched by Bayes optimization in 30 trials. The trained model was tested with the 60 original hold-out instances for performance evaluation in accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC). Results: The proposed system can grade NIHSS scores with an accuracy of 83.3% and an AUC of 0.912 using an optimized ensemble algorithm, and it can grade with an accuracy of 80.0% and an AUC of 0.860 using an optimized SVM algorithm. The auto-MRC grading achieved an accuracy of 76.7% and a mean AUC of 0.870 in SVM classification and an accuracy of 78.3% and a mean AUC of 0.877 in ensemble classification. Conclusions: The automatic grading system quantifies proximal weakness in real time and assesses symptoms through automatic grading. The pilot outcomes demonstrated the feasibility of remote monitoring of motor weakness caused by stroke. The system can facilitate consistent grading with instant assessment and expedite dispatches to appropriate hospitals and treatment initiation by sharing auto-MRC and auto-NIHSS scores between prehospital and hospital responses as an objective observation.

N2  - Parkinson's disease is a neuro-degenerative disorder characterized by the progressive death of dopamine neurons. This leads to delayed and uncoordinated movements, and impacts on the patients’ motor performance with reduced movement intensity, increased axial rigidity and impaired cadence regulation. Turning provides privileged insights in postural instability and fall prediction, as it is regularly performed during daily activities, requires multi-limb coordination. The objective of this work was to define a Quality of Movement (QoM) index, inferred from inertial data related to turns, and strictly correlated with the patient's motor conditions, postural stability, and stage of the disease. Such a concise representation finds its main application in the remote monitoring of patients during daily activities at home. We have recorded and analyzed 180° turns in 72 patients, using inertial sensors embedded in the smartphone. We have set up an algorithm for binary classification of patients: mild vs. moderate/severe conditions, according to the Hoehn and Yahr scale of disease progression and disability degree. Our QoM index is defined as the a posteriori probability output by this binary classifier. It exhibits high correlation (r = 0.73) with the clinical score of postural stability, as well as with the average of four clinical scores related to movement impairment (r = 0.75). These results, together with the widespread smartphone use, provide a step in the direction of a practical, objective and reliable tool for PD patients remote monitoring in domestic environment.

N2  - Internet of Things (IoT) technologies have been applied to various fields such as manufacturing, automobile industry and healthcare. IoT-based healthcare has a significant impact on real-time remote monitoring of patients’ health and consequently improving treatments and reducing healthcare costs. In fact, IoT has made healthcare more reliable, efficient, and accessible. Two major drawbacks which IoT suffers from can be expressed as: first, the limited battery capacity of the sensors is quickly depleted due to the continuous stream of data; second, the dependence of the system on the cloud for computations and processing causes latency in data transmission which is not accepted in real-time monitoring applications. This research is conducted to develop a real-time, secure, and energy-efficient platform which provides a solution for reducing computation load on the cloud and diminishing data transmission delay. In the proposed platform, the sensors utilize a state-of-the-art power saving technique known as Compressive Sensing (CS). CS allows sensors to retrieve the sensed data using fewer measurements by sending a compressed signal. In this framework, the signal reconstruction and processing are computed locally on a Heterogeneous Multicore Platform (HMP) device to decrease the dependency on the cloud. In addition, a framework has been implemented to control the system, set different parameters, display the data as well as send live notifications to medical experts through the cloud in order to alert them of any eventual hazardous event or abnormality and allow quick interventions. Finally, a case study of the system is presented demonstrating the acquisition and monitoring of the data for a given subject in real-time. The obtained results reveal that the proposed solution reduces 15.4% of energy consumption in sensors, that makes this prototype a good candidate for IoT employment in healthcare.

So Soldiers security purpose, more devices are set up on them to observe Soldiers health condition as well as their actual time position. This report provides ability to track the position and observes health condition of the soldiers in present time who become lost and get damaged in the battleground. It serves to reduce the time, search and recovery operation efforts of army control system. Bio-sensor systems provide various kinds of small-cost physiological sensors, communication factors and facilities and thus can provide unobtrusive, cheap wearable solutions for health monitoring. For patient health monitoring systems we use the wireless body area networks (WBAN) is a such system that implements the regular control over or inside the human body for the long time and it supports the transmission real time traffic such as the data, voice, video to look at the status of the basic organs functions. For the soldiers health monitoring k-means clustering algorithms and hierarchical clustering algorithms are used. K-means clustering method and hierarchical clustering methods is the one of the methods of the machine learning. The gathered data will be uploaded on the cloud for the analysis of the data and the estimates. By using the K-means clustering method and the hierarchical clustering algorithm.

N2  - In healthcare, physical activity can be monitored in two ways: self-monitoring by the patient himself or external monitoring by health professionals. Regarding self-monitoring, wearable activity trackers allow automated passive data collection that educate and motivate patients. Wearing an activity tracker can improve walking time by around 1500 steps per day. However, there are concerns about measurement accuracy (e.g., lack of a common validation protocol or measurement discrepancies between different devices). For external monitoring, many innovative electronic tools are currently used in rheumatology to help support physician time management, to reduce the burden on clinic time, and to prioritize patients who may need further attention. In inflammatory arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis, regular monitoring of patients to detect disease flares improves outcomes. In a pilot study applying machine learning to activity tracker steps, we showed that physical activity was strongly linked to disease flares and that patterns of physical activity could be used to predict flares with great accuracy, with a sensitivity and specificity above 95%. Thus, automatic monitoring of steps may lead to improved disease control through potential early identification of disease flares. However, activity trackers have some limitations when applied to rheumatic patients, such as tracker adherence, lack of clarity on long-term effectiveness, or the potential multiplicity of trackers.

N2  - Purpose of Review: This review discusses how wearable devices—sensors externally applied to the body to measure a physiological signal—can be used in heart failure (HF) care. Recent Findings: Most wearables are marketed to consumers and can measure movement, heart rate, and blood pressure; detect and monitor arrhythmia; and support exercise training and rehabilitation. Wearable devices targeted at healthcare professionals include ECG patch recorders and vests, patches, and textiles with in-built sensors for improved prognostication and the early detection of acute decompensation. Integrating data from wearables into clinical decision-making has been slow due to clinical inertia and concerns regarding data security and validity, lack of evidence of meaningful impact, interoperability, regulatory and reimbursement issues, and legal liability. Summary: Although few studies have assessed how best to integrate wearable technologies into clinical practice, their use is rapidly expanding and may support improved decision-making by patients and healthcare professionals along the whole patient pathway.

N2  - Introduction There is an outbreak of COVID-19 worldwide. As there is no effective therapy or vaccine yet, rigorous implementation of traditional public health measures such as isolation and quarantine remains the most effective tool to control the outbreak. When an asymptomatic individual with COVID-19 exposure is being quarantined, it is necessary to perform temperature and symptom surveillance. As such surveillance is intermittent in nature and highly dependent on self-discipline, it has limited effectiveness. Advances in biosensor technologies made it possible to continuously monitor physiological parameters using wearable biosensors with a variety of form factors. Objective To explore the potential of using wearable biosensors to continuously monitor multidimensional physiological parameters for early detection of COVID-19 clinical progression. Method This randomised controlled open-labelled trial will involve 200-1000 asymptomatic subjects with close COVID-19 contact under mandatory quarantine at designated facilities in Hong Kong. Subjects will be randomised to receive a remote monitoring strategy (intervention group) or standard strategy (control group) in a 1:1 ratio during the 14 day-quarantine period. In addition to fever and symptom surveillance in the control group, subjects in the intervention group will wear wearable biosensors on their arms to continuously monitor skin temperature, respiratory rate, blood pressure, pulse rate, blood oxygen saturation and daily activities. These physiological parameters will be transferred in real time to a smartphone application called Biovitals Sentinel. These data will then be processed using a cloud-based multivariate physiology analytics engine called Biovitals to detect subtle physiological changes. The results will be displayed on a web-based dashboard for clinicians' review. The primary outcome is the time to diagnosis of COVID-19. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been obtained from institutional review boards at the study sites. Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals.

N2  - This paper is to provide smooth movement to paralyzed, old and physically impaired people and also the model is integrated with healthcare monitoring unit which helps in predicting disease such as heart disease, viral fever/ malaria, jaundice, food poisoning. In order to provide aid to these people, robotic and healthcare technologies have been used to design a prototype of Automated Wheelchair with Healthcare Monitoring System (AWHMS).The idea is to combine Cloud Computing, IOT and Machine Learning to use the concept of Electromyography (EMG), DS18b20 thermometer and pulse sensor.Android App acts as a central host which integrates the entire system. Spring boot framework is used to provide backend support to the app and OkHttp framework is used to make network requests on android.There are four inputs where IP address of Motor MCU (micro-controller unit), Sensor MCU, Controller MCU and Cloud have to be entered. Based on the user’s input controls can be switched. The user has to select his symptoms and based on the inputs received from the user the proposed Machine Learning Disease Predictor (MLDP) will predict the disease.This is ought to provide relief to people. The different controlling mechanisms will allow the chair to move with less human intervention. This project will be useful for future research works and will change the life of entire humankind.

N2  - Background: The response to COVID-19 catalyzed the adoption and integration of digital health tools into the health care delivery model for musculoskeletal patients. The change, suspension, or relaxation of Medicare and federal guidelines enabled the rapid implementation of these technologies. The expansion of payment models for virtual care facilitated its rapid adoption. The authors aim to provide several examples of digital health solutions utilized to manage orthopedic patients during the pandemic and discuss what features of these technologies are likely to continue to provide value to patients and clinicians following its resolution. Conclusion: The widespread adoption of new technologies enabling providers to care for patients remotely has the potential to permanently change the expectations of all stakeholders about the way care is provided in orthopedics. The new era of Digital Orthopaedics will see a gradual and nondisruptive integration of technologies that support the patient's journey through the successful management of their musculoskeletal disease.

N2  - Background: Capacity to deliver outpatient care for patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) may soon be outweighed by need. This systematic review aims to investigate the comparative effectiveness, safety, and cost for virtual or remote clinic interventions for patients with CIEDs and explores how outcomes may be influenced by patient or system factors in-depth. Methods: We will perform a systematic literature search in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Proquest Dissertations & Theses, other EBM Reviews, and trial registry databases. Two authors will independently screen titles and abstracts for eligibility. We will include randomized and non-randomized controlled trials, quasi-randomized and experimental studies, cohort, and case-control studies. Study populations of interest are individuals with a CIED (pacemaker, ICD, CRT). Eligibility will be restricted to virtual or remote follow-up or care interventions compared to any other approach. The co-primary outcomes of interest are mortality and patient satisfaction. Secondary outcomes include clinical effectiveness (e.g., ICD shock, time-to-detection of medical event, hospitalizations), safety (e.g., serious or device-related adverse events), device efficacy (e.g., transmissions, malfunctions), costs, workflow (e.g., resources, process outcomes, time-saved), and patient reported (e.g., burden, quality of life). Data will be extracted by one author and checked by a second using a standardized template. We will use published frameworks to capture data relevant to intervention effects that may be influenced by intervention definition or complexity, context and setting, or in socially disadvantaged populations. Detailed descriptive results will be presented for all included studies and outcomes, and where feasible, synthesized using meta-analysis. Risk of bias will be assessed by two review authors independently using Cochrane Risk of Bias tools. Certainty of evidence will be assessed using the GRADE approach. Discussion: Increases in number of CIEDs implanted, combined with an aging population and finite health resource allocations at the system-level may lead to increased reliance on virtual follow-up or care models in the future. These models must prioritize consistent, equitable, and timely care as a priority. Results from this systematic review will provide important insight into the potential contextual factors which moderate or mediate the effectiveness, safety, and cost of virtual follow-up or care models for patients.

N2  - Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are often characterized by their multifactorial complexity. This makes remote monitoring and ambulatory cardiac rehabilitation (CR) therapy challenging. Current wearable multimodal devices enable remote monitoring. Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) can help in tackling multifaceted datasets. However, for clinical acceptance, easy interpretability of the AI models is crucial. The goal of the present study was to investigate whether a multi-parameter sensor could be used during a standardized activity test to interpret functional capacity in the longitudinal follow-up of CR patients. A total of 129 patients were followed for 3 months during CR using 6-min walking tests (6MWT) equipped with a wearable ECG and accelerometer device. Functional capacity was assessed based on 6MWT distance (6MWD). Linear and nonlinear interpretable models were explored to predict 6MWD. The t-distributed stochastic neighboring embedding (t-SNE) technique was exploited to embed and visualize high dimensional data. The performance of support vector machine (SVM) models, combining different features and using different kernel types, to predict functional capacity was evaluated. The SVM model, using chronotropic response and effort as input features, showed a mean absolute error of 42.8 m (±36.8 m). The 3D-maps derived using the t-SNE technique visualized the relationship between sensor-derived biomarkers and functional capacity, which enables tracking of the evolution of patients throughout the CR program. The current study showed that wearable monitoring combined with interpretable ML can objectively track clinical progression in a CR population. These results pave the road towards ambulatory CR.

N2  - Purpose of Review: Out-of-office blood pressure (BP) monitoring techniques, including home and ambulatory BP monitoring, are currently recommended by hypertension guidelines worldwide to confirm the diagnosis of hypertension and to monitor the appropriateness of treatment. However, such techniques are not always effectively implemented or timely available in the routine clinical practice. In recent years, the widespread availability of e-health solutions has stimulated the development of blood pressure telemonitoring (BPT) systems, which allow remote BP tracking and tighter and more efficient monitoring of patients’ health status. Recent Findings: There is currently strong evidence that BPT may be of benefit for hypertension screening and diagnosis and for improving hypertension management. The advantage is more significant when BPT is coupled with multimodal interventions involving a physician, a nurse or pharmacist, and including education on lifestyle and risk factors and drug management. Several randomized controlled studies documented enhanced hypertension management and improved BP control of hypertensive patients through BPT. Potential additional effects of BPT are represented by improved compliance to treatment, intensification, and optimization of drug use, improved quality of life, reduction in risk of developing cardiovascular complications, and cost-saving. Applications based on m-health and making use of wearables or smartwatches integrated with machine learning models are particularly promising for the future development of efficient BPT solutions, and they will provide remarkable support decision tools for doctors. Summary: BPT and telehealth will soon disrupt hypertension management. However, which approach will be the most effective and whether it will be sustainable in the long-term still need to be elucidated.

N2  - Background: Due to demographic change and, more recently, coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the importance of modern intensive care units (ICU) is becoming apparent. One of the key components of an ICU is the continuous monitoring of patients' vital parameters. However, existing advances in informatics, signal processing, or engineering that could alleviate the burden on ICUs have not yet been applied. This could be due to the lack of user involvement in research and development. Objective: This study focused on the satisfaction of ICU staff with current patient monitoring and their suggestions for future improvements. We aimed to identify aspects of monitoring that interrupt patient care, display devices for remote monitoring, use cases for artificial intelligence (AI), and whether ICU staff members are willing to improve their digital literacy or contribute to the improvement of patient monitoring. We further aimed to identify differences in the responses of different professional groups. Methods: This survey study was performed with ICU staff from 4 ICUs of a German university hospital between November 2019 and January 2020. We developed a web-based 36-item survey questionnaire, by analyzing a preceding qualitative interview study with ICU staff, about the clinical requirements of future patient monitoring. Statistical analyses of questionnaire results included median values with their bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals, and chi-square tests to compare the distributions of item responses of the professional groups. Results: In total, 86 of the 270 ICU physicians and nurses completed the survey questionnaire. The majority stated they felt confident using the patient monitoring equipment, but that high rates of false-positive alarms and the many sensor cables interrupted patient care. Regarding future improvements, respondents asked for wireless sensors, a reduction in the number of false-positive alarms, and hospital standard operating procedures for alarm management. Responses to the display devices proposed for remote patient monitoring were divided. Most respondents indicated it would be useful for earlier alerting or when they were responsible for multiple wards. AI for ICUs would be useful for early detection of complications and an increased risk of mortality; in addition, the AI could propose guidelines for therapy and diagnostics. Transparency, interoperability, usability, and staff training were essential to promote the use of AI. The majority wanted to learn more about new technologies for the ICU and required more time for learning. Physicians had fewer reservations than nurses about AI-based intelligent alarm management and using mobile phones for remote monitoring. Conclusions: This survey study of ICU staff revealed key improvements for patient monitoring in intensive care medicine. Hospital providers and medical device manufacturers should focus on reducing false alarms, implementing hospital alarm standard operating procedures, introducing wireless sensors, preparing for the use of AI, and enhancing the digital literacy of ICU staff. Our results may contribute to the user-centered transfer of digital technologies into practice to alleviate challenges in intensive care medicine.

N2  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease affecting millions worldwide. Bespoke subject-specific treatment (medication or deep brain stimulation (DBS)) is critical for management, yet depends on precise assessment cardinal PD symptoms - bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor. Clinician diagnosis is the basis of treatment, yet it allows only a cross-sectional assessment of symptoms which can vary on an hourly basis and is liable to inter- and intra-rater subjectivity across human examiners. Automated symptomatic assessment has attracted significant interest to optimise treatment regimens between clinician visits, however, no wearable has the capacity to simultaneously assess all three cardinal symptoms. Challenges in the measurement of rigidity, mapping muscle activity out-of-clinic and sensor fusion have inhibited translation. In this study, we address all through a novel wearable sensor system and machine learning algorithms. The sensor system is composed of a force-sensor, three inertial measurement units (IMUs) and four custom mechanomyography (MMG) sensors. The system was tested in its capacity to predict Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores based on quantitative assessment of bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor in PD patients. 23 PD patients were tested with the sensor system in parallel with exams conducted by treating clinicians and 10 healthy subjects were recruited as a comparison control group. Results prove the system accurately predicts UPDRS scores for all symptoms (85.4% match on average with physician assessment) and discriminates between healthy subjects and PD patients (96.6% on average). MMG features can also be used for remote monitoring of severity and fluctuations in PD symptoms out-of-clinic. This closed-loop feedback system enables individually tailored and regularly updated treatment, facilitating better outcomes for a very large patient population.

N2  - Historically, the term "artificial intelligence" dates to 1956 when it was first used in a conference at Dartmouth College in the US. Since then, the development of artificial intelligence has in part been shaped by the field of neuroscience. By understanding the human brain, scientists have attempted to build new intelligent machines capable of performing complex tasks akin to humans. Indeed, future research into artificial intelligence will continue to benefit from the study of the human brain. While the development of artificial intelligence algorithms has been fast paced, the actual use of most artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in biomedical engineering and clinical practice is still markedly below its conceivably broader potentials. This is partly because for any algorithm to be incorporated into existing workflows it has to stand the test of scientific validation, clinical and personal utility, application context, and is equitable as well. In this context, there is much to be gained by combining AI and human intelligence (HI). Harnessing Big Data, computing power and storage capacities, and addressing societal issues emergent from algorithm applications, demand deploying HI in tandem with AI. Very few countries, even economically developed states, lack adequate and critical governance frames to best understand and steer the AI innovation trajectories in health care. Drug discovery and translational pharmaceutical research stand to gain from AI technology provided they are also informed by HI. In this expert review, we analyze the ways in which AI applications are likely to traverse the continuum of life from birth to death, and encompassing not only humans but also all animal, plant, and other living organisms that are increasingly touched by AI. Examples of AI applications include digital health, diagnosis of diseases in newborns, remote monitoring of health by smart devices, real-time Big Data analytics for prompt diagnosis of heart attacks, and facial analysis software with consequences on civil liberties. While we underscore the need for integration of AI and HI, we note that AI technology does not have to replace medical specialists or scientists and rather, is in need of such expert HI. Altogether, AI and HI offer synergy for responsible innovation and veritable prospects for improving health care from prevention to diagnosis to therapeutics while unintended consequences of automation emergent from AI and algorithms should be borne in mind on scientific cultures, work force, and society at large.

N2  - Digitization of healthcare will be a major innovation driver in the coming decade. Also, enabled by technological advancements and electronics miniaturization, wearable health device (WHD) applications are expected to grow exponentially. This, in turn, may make 4P medicine (predictive, precise, preventive and personalized) a more attainable goal within dialysis patient care. This article discusses different use cases where WHD could be of relevance for dialysis patient care, i.e. measurement of heart rate, arrhythmia detection, blood pressure, hyperkalaemia, fluid overload and physical activity. After adequate validation of the different WHD in this specific population, data obtained from WHD could form part of a body area network (BAN), which could serve different purposes such as feedback on actionable parameters like physical inactivity, fluid overload, danger signalling or event prediction. For a BAN to become clinical reality, not only must technical issues, cybersecurity and data privacy be addressed, but also adequate models based on artificial intelligence and mathematical analysis need to be developed for signal optimization, data representation, data reliability labelling and interpretation. Moreover, the potential of WHD and BAN can only be fulfilled if they are part of a transformative healthcare system with a shared responsibility between patients, healthcare providers and the payors, using a step-up approach that may include digital assistants and dedicated 'digital clinics'. The coming decade will be critical in observing how these developments will impact and transform dialysis patient care and will undoubtedly ask for an increased 'digital literacy' for all those implicated in their care.

N2  - Background: Implantable cardiac sensors have shown promise in reducing rehospitalization for heart failure (HF), but the efficacy of noninvasive approaches has not been determined. The objective of this study was to determine the accuracy of noninvasive remote monitoring in predicting HF rehospitalization. Methods: The LINK-HF study (Multisensor Non-invasive Remote Monitoring for Prediction of Heart Failure Exacerbation) examined the performance of a personalized analytical platform using continuous data streams to predict rehospitalization after HF admission. Study subjects were monitored for up to 3 months using a disposable multisensor patch placed on the chest that recorded physiological data. Data were uploaded continuously via smartphone to a cloud analytics platform. Machine learning was used to design a prognostic algorithm to detect HF exacerbation. Clinical events were formally adjudicated. Results: One hundred subjects aged 68.4±10.2 years (98% male) were enrolled. After discharge, the analytical platform derived a personalized baseline model of expected physiological values. Differences between baseline model estimated vital signs and actual monitored values were used to trigger a clinical alert. There were 35 unplanned nontrauma hospitalization events, including 24 worsening HF events. The platform was able to detect precursors of hospitalization for HF exacerbation with 76% to 88% sensitivity and 85% specificity. Median time between initial alert and readmission was 6.5 (4.2-13.7) days. Conclusions: Multivariate physiological telemetry from a wearable sensor can provide accurate early detection of impending rehospitalization with a predictive accuracy comparable to implanted devices. The clinical efficacy and generalizability of this low-cost noninvasive approach to rehospitalization mitigation should be further tested.

N2  - Recently, wearable and flexible pressure sensors have sparked tremendous research interest, and considerable applications including human activity monitoring, biomedical research, and artificial intelligence interaction are reported. However, the large-scale preparation of low-cost, high-sensitivity piezoresistive sensors still face huge challenges. Inspired by the specific structures and excellent metal conductivity of a family of two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal carbides and nitrides (MXene) and the high-performance sensing effect of human skin including randomly distributed microstructural receptors, we fabricate a highly sensitive MXene-based piezoresistive sensor with bioinspired microspinous microstructures formed by a simple abrasive paper stencil printing process. The obtained piezoresistive sensor shows high sensitivity (151.4 kPa-1), relatively short response time (<130 ms), subtle pressure detection limit of 4.4 Pa, and excellent cycle stability over 10,000 cycles. The mechanism of the high sensitivity of the sensor is dynamically revealed from the structural perspective by means of in situ electron microscopy experiment and finite element simulation. Bioinspired microspinous microstructures can effectively improve the sensitivity of the pressure sensor and the limit of the detectable subtle pressure. In practice, the sensor shows great performance in monitoring human physiological signals, detecting quantitatively pressure distributions, and remote monitoring of intelligent robot motion in real time.

N2  - Background and Aims: The current use of Health Technology Assessment (HTA) as a supporting tool for decision-making still varies considerably across different healthcare systems in Europe thus resulting in inefficiency of actual reporting of HTA. The new H2020 project, HTx (htx-h2020.eu) aims to develop a framework for next generation HTA that supports patient-centred, societally-oriented, real-time decision-making for integrated healthcare. Four different case studies will be performed to cover different types of disease areas, technologies and treatment strategies, one of them is focused on T1DM and T2DM. Methods: HTx proposes the use of methods to bring together data from different sources such as Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT) and real-world data (RWD) with classical prediction modelling and artificial intelligence algorithms to integrate existing evidence and estimate relative clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in complicated treatment and monitoring pathways. Results: In T1DM and T2DM, the expected results are to assess the impact of using medical devices such as insulin infusion pumps, continuous glucose monitoring and glucose meters, e-health technologies such as tele-monitoring complemented by data visualization and decision support; and/or life-style interventions. We will link data from RCTs on these technologies to large population-based diabetes registries and health care claims data. Conclusions: HTx should be able to provide more accurate estimations of the differential health impact of the technologies in specific subgroups of patients with Diabetes; predict which treatments combinations are most beneficial and costeffective and facilitate tools that support patients and their healthcare providers in making personal decisions on the best treatment.

N2  - In this paper we proposed a wearable electrocardiogram (ECG) telemonitoring system for atrial fibrillation (AF) detection based on a smartphone and cloud computing. A wearable ECG patch was designed to collect ECG signals and send the signals to an Android smartphone via Bluetooth. An Android APP was developed to display the ECG waveforms in real time and transmit every 30 s ECG data to a remote cloud server. A machine learning (CatBoost)-based ECG classification method was proposed to detect AF in the cloud server. In case of detected AF, the cloud server pushed the ECG data and classification results to the web browser of a doctor. Finally, the Android APP displayed the doctor's diagnosis for the ECG signals. Experimental results showed the proposed CatBoost classifier trained with 17 selected features achieved an overall F1 score of 0.92 on the test set (n = 7,270). The proposed wearable ECG monitoring system may potentially be useful for long-term ECG telemonitoring for AF detection.

N2  - This article serves as the introduction to this special issue on Mobile Health and Mobile Rehabilitation for People with Disabilities. Social, technological and policy trends are reviewed. Needs, opportunities and challenges for the emerging fields of mobile health (mHealth, aka eHealth) and mobile rehabilitation (mRehab) are discussed. Healthcare in the United States (U.S.) is at a critical juncture characterized by: (1) a growing need for healthcare and rehabilitation services; (2) maturing technological capabilities to support more effective and efficient health services; (3) evolving public policies designed, by turns, to contain cost and support new models of care; and (4) a growing need to ensure acceptance and usability of new health technologies by people with disabilities and chronic conditions, clinicians and health delivery systems. Discussion of demographic and population health data, healthcare service delivery and a public policy primarily focuses on the U.S. However, trends identified (aging populations, growing prevalence of chronic conditions and disability, labor shortages in healthcare) apply to most countries with advanced economies and others. Furthermore, technologies that enable mRehab (wearable sensors, in-home environmental monitors, cloud computing, artificial intelligence) transcend national boundaries. Remote and mobile healthcare delivery is needed and inevitable. Proactive engagement is critical to ensure acceptance and effectiveness for all stakeholders.

N2  - Objective: Autonomic Dysreflexia (AD) is a potentially life-threatening syndrome which occurs in individuals with higher level spinal cord injuries (SCI). AD is caused by triggers which can lead to rapid escalation of pathophysiological responses and if the trigger is not removed, AD can be fatal. There is currently no objective, non-invasive and accurate monitoring system available to automatically detect the onset of AD symptoms in real time in a non-clinical setting. Technology or Method: We developed a user-independent method of symptomatic AD detection in real time with a wearable physiological telemetry system (PTS) and a machine learning model using data from eleven participants with SCI. Results: The PTS could detect onset of AD symptoms with an average accuracy of 94.10% and a false negative rate of 4.89%. Conclusions: The PTS can detect the onset of the symptoms AD with high sensitivity and specificity to assist people with SCIs in preventing the occurrence of AD. It would enable persons with high level SCIs to be more independent and pursue vocational activities while granting continuous medical oversight. Clinical Impact: The PTS could serve as a supplementary tool to current solutions to detect the onset of AD and prepare individuals who are newly injured to be better prepared for AD episodes. Moreover, it could be translated into a system to encourage individuals to practice better healthcare management to prevent future occurrences.

N2  - The clinical assessment technology such as remote monitoring of rehabilitation progress for lower limb related ailments rely on the automatic evaluation of movement performed along with an estimation of joint angle information. In this paper, we introduce a transfer-learning based Long-term Recurrent Convolution Network (LRCN) named as 'MyoNet' for the classification of lower limb movements, along with the prediction of the corresponding knee joint angle. The model consists of three blocks- (i) feature extractor block, (ii) joint angle prediction block, and (iii) movement classification block. Initially, the model is end-to-end trained for knee joint angle prediction followed by transferring the knowledge of a trained model to the movement classification through transfer-learning approach making a memory and computationally efficient design. The proposed MyoNet was evaluated on publicly available University of California (UC) Irvine machine learning repository dataset of the lower limb for 11 healthy subjects and 11 subjects with knee pathology for three movements type-walking, standing with knee flexion movements and sitting with knee extension movements. The average mean absolute error (MAE) resulted in the prediction of joint angle for healthy subjects and subjects with knee pathology are 8.1 % and 9.2 % respectively. Subsequently, an average classification accuracy of 98.1 % and 92.4 % were achieved for healthy subjects and subjects with knee pathology, respectively. Interestingly, the significance of this study in itself is promising with substantial improvement in the performance compared to state-of-the-art methodologies. The clinical significance of such surface electromyography signals (sEMG) based movement recognition and prediction of corresponding joint angle system could be beneficial for remote monitoring of rehabilitation progress by the physiotherapist using wearables.

N2  - Wearable sensor-based devices are increasingly applied in free-living and clinical settings to collect fine-grained, objective data about activity and sleep behavior. The manufacturers of these devices provide proprietary software that labels the sensor data at specified time intervals with activity and sleep information. If the device wearer has a health condition affecting their movement, such as a stroke, these labels and their values can vary greatly from manufacturer to manufacturer. Consequently, generating outcome predictions based on data collected from patients attending inpatient rehabilitation wearing different sensor devices can be challenging, which hampers usefulness of these data for patient care decisions. In this article, we present a data-driven approach to combining datasets collected from different device manufacturers. With the ability to combine datasets, we merge data from three different device manufacturers to form a larger dataset of time series data collected from 44 patients receiving inpatient therapy services. To gain insights into the recovery process, we use this dataset to build models that predict a patient's next day physical activity duration and next night sleep duration. Using our data-driven approach and the combined dataset, we obtained a normalized root mean square error prediction of 9.11% for daytime physical activity and 11.18% for nighttime sleep duration. Our sleep result is comparable to the accuracy we achieved using the manufacturer's sleep labels (12.26%). Our device-independent predictions are suitable for both point-of-care and remote monitoring applications to provide information to clinicians for customizing therapy services and potentially decreasing recovery time.
