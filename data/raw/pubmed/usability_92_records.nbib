TI  - Improvements in Patient Monitoring in the Intensive Care Unit: Survey Study.
PG  - e19091
LID - 10.2196/19091 [doi]
LID - e19091
AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to demographic change and, more recently, coronavirus disease 
      (COVID-19), the importance of modern intensive care units (ICU) is becoming 
      apparent. One of the key components of an ICU is the continuous monitoring of 
      patients' vital parameters. However, existing advances in informatics, signal 
      processing, or engineering that could alleviate the burden on ICUs have not yet 
      been applied. This could be due to the lack of user involvement in research and 
      development. OBJECTIVE: This study focused on the satisfaction of ICU staff with 
      current patient monitoring and their suggestions for future improvements. We 
      aimed to identify aspects of monitoring that interrupt patient care, display 
      devices for remote monitoring, use cases for artificial intelligence (AI), and 
      whether ICU staff members are willing to improve their digital literacy or 
      contribute to the improvement of patient monitoring. We further aimed to identify 
      differences in the responses of different professional groups. METHODS: This 
      survey study was performed with ICU staff from 4 ICUs of a German university 
      hospital between November 2019 and January 2020. We developed a web-based 36-item 
      survey questionnaire, by analyzing a preceding qualitative interview study with 
      ICU staff, about the clinical requirements of future patient monitoring. 
      Statistical analyses of questionnaire results included median values with their 
      bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals, and chi-square tests to compare the 
      distributions of item responses of the professional groups. RESULTS: In total, 86 
      of the 270 ICU physicians and nurses completed the survey questionnaire. The 
      majority stated they felt confident using the patient monitoring equipment, but 
      that high rates of false-positive alarms and the many sensor cables interrupted 
      patient care. Regarding future improvements, respondents asked for wireless 
      sensors, a reduction in the number of false-positive alarms, and hospital 
      standard operating procedures for alarm management. Responses to the display 
      devices proposed for remote patient monitoring were divided. Most respondents 
      indicated it would be useful for earlier alerting or when they were responsible 
      for multiple wards. AI for ICUs would be useful for early detection of 
      complications and an increased risk of mortality; in addition, the AI could 
      propose guidelines for therapy and diagnostics. Transparency, interoperability, 
      usability, and staff training were essential to promote the use of AI. The 
      majority wanted to learn more about new technologies for the ICU and required 
      more time for learning. Physicians had fewer reservations than nurses about 
      AI-based intelligent alarm management and using mobile phones for remote 
      monitoring. CONCLUSIONS: This survey study of ICU staff revealed key improvements 
      for patient monitoring in intensive care medicine. Hospital providers and medical 
      device manufacturers should focus on reducing false alarms, implementing hospital 
      alarm standard operating procedures, introducing wireless sensors, preparing for 
      the use of AI, and enhancing the digital literacy of ICU staff. Our results may 
      contribute to the user-centered transfer of digital technologies into practice to 
      alleviate challenges in intensive care medicine. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Continuous Monitoring of Vital Signs in the General Ward Using Wearable Devices: 
      Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - e15471
LID - 10.2196/15471 [doi]
LID - e15471
AB  - BACKGROUND: Wearable devices can be used for continuous patient monitoring in the 
      general ward, increasing patient safety. Little is known about the experiences 
      and expectations of patients and health care professionals regarding continuous 
      monitoring with these devices. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify positive 
      and negative effects as well as barriers and facilitators for the use of two 
      wearable devices: ViSi Mobile (VM) and HealthPatch (HP). METHODS: In this 
      randomized controlled trial, 90 patients admitted to the internal medicine and 
      surgical wards of a university hospital in the Netherlands were randomly assigned 
      to continuous vital sign monitoring using VM or HP and a control group. Users' 
      experiences and expectations were addressed using semistructured interviews. 
      Nurses, physician assistants, and medical doctors were also interviewed. 
      Interviews were analyzed using thematic content analysis. Psychological distress 
      was assessed using the State Trait Anxiety Inventory and the Pain Catastrophizing 
      Scale. The System Usability Scale was used to assess the usability of both 
      devices. RESULTS: A total of 60 patients, 20 nurses, 3 physician assistants, and 
      6 medical doctors were interviewed. We identified 47 positive and 30 negative 
      effects and 19 facilitators and 36 barriers for the use of VM and HP. Frequently 
      mentioned topics included earlier identification of clinical deterioration, 
      increased feelings of safety, and VM lines and electrodes. No differences related 
      to psychological distress and usability were found between randomization groups 
      or devices. CONCLUSIONS: Both devices were well received by most patients and 
      health care professionals, and the majority of them encouraged the idea of 
      monitoring vital signs continuously in the general ward. This comprehensive 
      overview of barriers and facilitators of using wireless devices may serve as a 
      guide for future researchers, developers, and health care institutions that 
      consider implementing continuous monitoring in the ward. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

AB  - BACKGROUND: The emergency for the COVID-19 pandemic has led to greater use of 
      home telemonitoring devices. The aim of this study was to assess the usability of 
      continuous home-monitoring care with an oxygen saturation device on post-COVID-19 
      patients. METHOD: The system consists of a digital continuous pulse oximeter and 
      a smartphone with an App, which were provided to patients. A survey composed of a 
      standard Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire, and a satisfaction 
      questionnaire was exploited to conduct a usability and feasibility analysis of 
      the service. RESULTS: A total of 29 patients (17.2% female) with a mean age of 
      65 ± 11.5 years were enrolled: 20 patients were smartphone users (69%) with a 
      mean age of 60.2 ± 9.5 years, and 9 patients (31%) did not own a smartphone (mean 
      age 76.8 ± 5.9). The monitoring period was 1 month: a total of 444 recordings 
      were conducted, 15 recordings per patient averagely. In total, 82% of the 
      recordings performed did not require any intervention, while 18% led to the 
      production of a report and subsequent intervention by a nurse who verified, 
      together with the specialist, the need to intervene (i.e. the patient accessed 
      the clinic for medical control and/or modification of oxygen therapy). A total of 
      17 patients compiled a usability questionnaire. The service was perceived as 
      useful and well-structured, although it often required caregiver support. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Using continuous home-monitoring care with an oxygen saturation 
      device seems feasible and useful for patients who could be followed at home 
      avoiding going back to the hospital every time a trend oximetry is needed. 
      Further improvements in connections, data flow processes, and simplifications, 
      based on patients' feedback, are needed to scale up the service.

LID - 10.1080/03091902.2024.2325964 [doi]
AB  - Although telehealth, and in particular RPM, have demonstrated to drive many 
      benefits, such as reduction in cost and hospital-acquired infections, previous 
      research has shown many usability challenges when patients operate a medical 
      device without supervision of a medical professional. To combat this issue, the 
      Pi-CON methodology is applied to develop a novel sensor with the objective to 
      continuously acquire a patient's vital signs from a distance, without the need to 
      attach any markers or sensors to the patient, and with limited user interaction 
      required. Pi-CON stands for passive, continuous and non-contact, and describes a 
      way to improve the user experience for patients or caregivers that have a need to 
      perform a vital signs measurement themselves, without the presence of a medical 
      professional. The developed sensor utilises radar and optical sensing 
      technologies and transmits acquired data to a cloud-based service where it can be 
      viewed in near real-time by the patient or family members from anywhere via an 
      intuitive user interface. This user interface, as well as the sensor itself were 
      designed based on design needs and requirements to adhere to the user-centered 
      design process. The development of the sensor, including utilised technologies, 
      components, and the user interface are presented, including inspirations for 
      future work.

TI  - Evolution of SmartBEAT for Heart Failure Telemonitoring.
PG  - 189-194
LID - 10.3233/SHTI200637 [doi]
AB  - The prevalence of Heart Failure is growing exponentially in the last decades, 
      particularly amongst older adults. Heart Failure is a chronic cardiovascular 
      disease that demands self-care management and substantial healthcare resources. 
      For that reason, it is highly associated with hospital readmissions and 
      mortality. Due to increased hospitalization costs, excessive waiting times and 
      lack of specialized healthcare professionals to follow-up this growing 
      population, telemedicine and telemonitoring technologies have become the best 
      solutions to support health providers in the disease management tasks. 
      Telemonitoring technologies offer better and more comfortable care because the 
      elderly do not have to leave the comfort of their home to interact with the 
      doctors, giving and receiving daily feedbacks trough these new applications,

LID - 10.3233/SHTI230572 [doi]
AB  - Assisted living services have become increasingly important in recent years as 
      the population ages and the demand for personalized care rises. In this paper, we 
      present the integration of wearable IoT devices in a remote monitoring platform 
      for elderly people that enables seamless data collection, analysis, and 
      visualization while in parallel, alarms and notification functionalities are 
      provided in the context of a personalized monitoring and care plan. The system 
      has been implemented using state-of-the-art technologies and methods to 
      facilitate robust operation, increased usability and real-time communication. The 
      user has the ability to record and visualise their activity, health and alarm 
      data using the tracking devices, and additionally settle an ecosystem of 
      relatives and informal carers to provide assistance daily or support in cases of 
      emergencies.

TI  - A Wireless Wearable Patch for Remote Monitoring of Respiratory and Cardiac Rhythm 
      in Children.
PG  - 1-4
LID - 10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10340323 [doi]
AB  - Remote patient monitoring (RPM) is an innovative strategy to promote health and 
      improve patient management and care. Recent advances in healthcare technologies 
      have seen the emergence of wearable sensors allowing longitudinal physiological 
      measurements in any environment. This paper introduces a wireless wearable patch 
      'Leo' for continuous remote monitoring of physiological data at home and 
      healthcare settings. This includes single lead ECG, chest impedance, heart rate 
      (HR), respiration rate (RR) and body posture. To test Leo's ability to capture 
      longitudinal physiological data at home, 15 children experiencing acute severe 
      asthma exacerbations were recruited during their emergency department (ED) 
      visits. Participants wore the Leo device for 7 (+/-2) days post-hospital 
      discharge. Nocturnal RR and HR and variability were higher during the first half 
      of the night on Day1 compared to Day7 (p<0.005). Participants also completed a 
      usability questionnaire and reported the patch wear to be comfortable (average 
      score of 3.3 out of 5) and easy to wear during the night (average score of 3.5 
      out of 5) with 5/15 (33%) reported very slight barely perceptible skin 
      irritation/redness and 2 (13%) reported well defined skin irritation and 
      redness.Clinical Relevance- These results highlight the potential use of the Leo 
      device in clinical practice for continuous un-obstructive monitoring of diseased 
      populations, such as asthma.

TI  - Design and Usability Assessment of a Multi-Device SOA-Based Telecare Framework 
      for the Elderly.
PG  - 268-279
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2019.2894552 [doi]
AB  - Telemonitoring is a branch of telehealth that aims at remotely monitoring vital 
      signs, which is important for chronically ill patients and the elderly living 
      alone. The available standalone devices and applications for the self-monitoring 
      of health parameters largely suffer from interoperability problems; meanwhile, 
      telemonitoring medical devices are expensive, self-contained, and are not 
      integrated into user-friendly technological platforms for the end user. This 
      paper presents the technical aspects and usability assessment of the 
      telemonitoring features of the HEREiAM platform, which supports heterogeneous 
      information technology systems. By exploiting a service-oriented architecture, 
      the measured parameters collected by off-the-shelf Bluetooth medical devices are 
      sent as XML documents to a private cloud that implements an interoperable health 
      service infrastructure, which is compliant with the most recent healthcare 
      standards and security protocols. This Android-based system is designed to be 
      accessible both via TV and portable devices, and includes other utilities 
      designed to support the elderly living alone. Four usability assessment sessions 
      with quality-validated questionnaires were performed to accurately understand the 
      ease of use, usefulness, acceptance, and quality of the proposed system. The 
      results reveal that our system achieved very high usability scores even at its 
      first use, and the scores did not significantly change over time during a field 
      trial that lasted for four months, reinforcing the idea of an intuitive design. 
      At the end of such a trial, the user-experience questionnaire achieved excellent 
      scores in all aspects with respect to the benchmark. Good results were also 
      reported by general practitioners who assessed the quality of their remote 
      interfaces for telemonitoring.

TI  - Introducing a Remote Patient Monitoring Usability Impact Model to Overcome 
      Challenges.
LID - 10.3390/s24123977 [doi]
LID - 3977
AB  - Telehealth and remote patient monitoring (RPM), in particular, have been through 
      a massive surge of adoption since 2020. This initiative has proven potential for 
      the patient and the healthcare provider in areas such as reductions in the cost 
      of care. While home-use medical devices or wearables have been shown to be 
      beneficial, a literature review illustrates challenges with the data generated, 
      driven by limited device usability. This could lead to inaccurate data when an 
      exam is completed without clinical supervision, with the consequence that 
      incorrect data lead to improper treatment. Upon further analysis of the existing 
      literature, the RPM Usability Impact model is introduced. The goal is to guide 
      researchers and device manufacturers to increase the usability of wearable and 
      home-use medical devices in the future. The importance of this model is 
      highlighted when the user-centered design process is integrated, which is needed 
      to develop these types of devices to provide the proper user experience.

TI  - A Sensor-Based mHealth Platform for Remote Monitoring and Intervention of Frailty 
      Patients at Home.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph182111730 [doi]
LID - 11730
AB  - Frailty syndrome is an independent risk factor for serious health episodes, 
      disability, hospitalization, falls, loss of mobility, and cardiovascular disease. 
      Its high reversibility demands personalized interventions among which exercise 
      programs are highly efficient to contribute to its delay. Information 
      technology-based solutions to support frailty have been recently approached, but 
      most of them are focused on assessment and not on intervention. This paper 
      describes a sensor-based mHealth platform integrated in a service-based 
      architecture inside the FRAIL project towards the remote monitoring and 
      intervention of pre-frail and frail patients at home. The aim of this platform is 
      constituting an efficient and scalable system for reducing both the impact of 
      aging and the advance of frailty syndrome. Among the results of this work are: 
      (1) the development of elderly-focused sensors and platform; (2) a technical 
      validation process of the sensor devices and the mHealth platform with young 
      adults; and (3) an assessment of usability and acceptability of the devices with 
      a set of pre-frail and frail patients. After the promising results obtained, 
      future steps of this work involve performing a clinical validation in order to 
      quantify the impact of the platform on health outcomes of frail patients.

TI  - Remote Wearable Neuroimaging Devices for Health Monitoring and Neurophenotyping: 
      A Scoping Review.
LID - 10.3390/biomimetics9040237 [doi]
LID - 237
AB  - Digital health tracking is a source of valuable insights for public health 
      research and consumer health technology. The brain is the most complex organ, 
      containing information about psychophysical and physiological biomarkers that 
      correlate with health. Specifically, recent developments in electroencephalogram 
      (EEG), functional near-infra-red spectroscopy (fNIRS), and photoplethysmography 
      (PPG) technologies have allowed the development of devices that can remotely 
      monitor changes in brain activity. The inclusion criteria for the papers in this 
      review encompassed studies on self-applied, remote, non-invasive neuroimaging 
      techniques (EEG, fNIRS, or PPG) within healthcare applications. A total of 23 
      papers were reviewed, comprising 17 on using EEGs for remote monitoring and 6 on 
      neurofeedback interventions, while no papers were found related to fNIRS and PPG. 
      This review reveals that previous studies have leveraged mobile EEG devices for 
      remote monitoring across the mental health, neurological, and sleep domains, as 
      well as for delivering neurofeedback interventions. With headsets and ear-EEG 
      devices being the most common, studies found mobile devices feasible for 
      implementation in study protocols while providing reliable signal quality. 
      Moderate to substantial agreement overall between remote and clinical-grade EEGs 
      was found using statistical tests. The results highlight the promise of portable 
      brain-imaging devices with regard to continuously evaluating patients in natural 
      settings, though further validation and usability enhancements are needed as this 
      technology develops.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical trials often face challenges in efficient data collection 
      and participant monitoring. To address these issues, we developed the IMPACT 
      platform, comprising a real-time mobile application for data collection and a 
      web-based dashboard for remote monitoring and management. METHODS: This article 
      presents the design, development, and usability assessment of the IMPACT platform 
      customized for patients with post-bariatric surgery hypoglycemia (PBH). We focus 
      on adapting key IMPACT components, including continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), 
      symptom tracking, and meal logging, as crucial elements for user-friendly and 
      efficient PBH monitoring. RESULTS: The adapted IMPACT platform demonstrated 
      effectiveness in data collection and remote participant monitoring. The mobile 
      application allowed patients to easily track their data, while the clinician 
      dashboard provided a comprehensive overview of enrolled patients, featuring 
      filtering options and alert mechanisms for identifying data collection issues. 
      The platform incorporated various visual representations, including time plots 
      and category-based visualizations, which greatly facilitated data interpretation 
      and analysis. The System Usability Scale questionnaire results indicated a high 
      level of usability for the web dashboard, with an average score of 86.3 out of 
      100. The active involvement of clinicians throughout the development process 
      ensured that the platform allowed for the collection and visualization of 
      clinically meaningful data. CONCLUSIONS: By leveraging IMPACT's existing features 
      and infrastructure, the adapted version streamlined data collection, analysis, 
      and trial customization for PBH research. The platform's high usability 
      underscores its alignment with the requirements for conducting research using 
      continuous real-world data in PBH patients and other populations of interest.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Remote monitoring technologies (RMTs) can measure cognitive and 
      functional decline objectively at-home, and offer opportunities to measure 
      passively and continuously, possibly improving sensitivity and reducing 
      participant burden in clinical trials. However, there is skepticism that age and 
      cognitive or functional impairment may render participants unable or unwilling to 
      comply with complex RMT protocols. We therefore assessed the feasibility and 
      usability of a complex RMT protocol in all syndromic stages of Alzheimer's 
      disease and in healthy control participants. METHODS: For 8 weeks, participants 
      (N = 229) used two activity trackers, two interactive apps with either daily or 
      weekly cognitive tasks, and optionally a wearable camera. A subset of 
      participants participated in a 4-week sub-study (N = 45) using fixed at-home 
      sensors, a wearable EEG sleep headband and a driving performance device. 
      Feasibility was assessed by evaluating compliance and drop-out rates. Usability 
      was assessed by problem rates (e.g., understanding instructions, discomfort, 
      forgetting to use the RMT or technical problems) as discussed during bi-weekly 
      semi-structured interviews. RESULTS: Most problems were found for the active apps 
      and EEG sleep headband. Problem rates increased and compliance rates decreased 
      with disease severity, but the study remained feasible. CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      shows that a highly complex RMT protocol is feasible, even in a mild-to-moderate 
      AD population, encouraging other researchers to use RMTs in their study designs. 
      We recommend evaluating the design of individual devices carefully before 
      finalizing study protocols, considering RMTs which allow for real-time compliance 
      monitoring, and engaging the partners of study participants in the research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Physiotherapy for persons with Parkinson's disease (PwPD) could 
      benefit from objective and continuous tracking of physical activity and falls in 
      daily life. OBJECTIVES: We designed a remote monitoring system for this purpose 
      and describe the experiences of PwPD and physiotherapists who used the system in 
      daily clinical practice. METHODS: Twenty-one PwPD (15 men) wore a sensor necklace 
      to passively record physical activity and falls for 6 weeks. They also used a 
      smartphone app to self-report daily activities, (near-)falls and medication 
      intake. They discussed those data with their PD-specialized physiotherapist (n = 
      9) during three regular treatment sessions. User experiences and aspects to be 
      improved were gathered through interviews with PwPD and physiotherapists, 
      resulting in system updates. The system was evaluated in a second pilot with 25 
      new PwPD (17 men) and eight physiotherapists. RESULTS: We applied thematic 
      analysis to the interview data resulting in two main themes: usability and 
      utility. First, the usability of the system was rated positively, with the 
      necklace being easy to use. However, some PwPD with limited digital literacy or 
      cognitive impairments found the app unclear. Second, the perceived utility of the 
      system varied among PwPD. While many PwPD were motivated to increase their 
      activity level, others were not additionally motivated because they perceived 
      their activity level as high. Physiotherapists appreciated the objective 
      recording of physical activity at home and used the monitoring of falls to 
      enlarge awareness of the importance of falls for PwPD. Based on the interview 
      data of all participants, we drafted three user profiles for PwPD regarding the 
      benefits of remote monitoring for physiotherapy: for profile 1, a monitoring 
      system could act as a flagging dashboard to signal the need for renewed 
      treatment; for profile 2, a monitoring system could be a motivational tool to 
      maintain physical activity; for profile 3, a monitoring system could passively 
      track physical activity and falls at home. Finally, for a subgroup of PwPD the 
      burdens of monitoring will outweigh the benefits. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, both PwPD 
      and physiotherapists underline the potential of a remote monitoring system to 
      support physiotherapy by targeting physical activity and (near-)falls. Our 
      findings emphasize the importance of personalization in remote monitoring 
      technology, as illustrated by our user profiles.

TI  - Comparison of Slate Safety Wearable Device to Ingestible Pill and Wearable Heart 
      Rate Monitor.
LID - 10.3390/s23020877 [doi]
LID - 877
AB  - BACKGROUND: With the increase in concern for deaths and illness related to the 
      increase in temperature globally, there is a growing need for real-time 
      monitoring of workers for heat stress indicators. The purpose of this study was 
      to determine the usability of the Slate Safety (SS) wearable physiological 
      monitoring system. METHODS: Twenty nurses performed a common task in a moderate 
      or hot environment while wearing the SS device, the Polar 10 monitor, and having 
      taken the e-Celsius ingestible pill. Data from each device was compared for 
      correlation and accuracy. RESULTS: High correlation was determined between the SS 
      wearable device and the Polar 10 system (0.926) and the ingestible pill (0.595). 
      The SS was comfortable to wear and easily monitored multiple participants from a 
      distance. CONCLUSIONS: The Slate Safety wearable device demonstrated accuracy in 
      measuring core temperature and heart rate while not restricting the motion of the 
      worker, and provided a remote monitoring platform for physiological parameters.

LID - 10.1177/1932296819895537 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Nightscout Project is a leading example of patient-designed, 
      do-it-yourself (DIY), open-source technology innovations to support type 1 
      diabetes management. We are unaware of studies that have described the evolution 
      of patient-driven innovations from the Nightscout Project to date. METHODS: We 
      identified patient-driven, DIY innovations from posts and comments in the "CGM in 
      the Cloud" private Facebook group as well as data from Twitter, GitHub, and the 
      Nightscout website. For each innovation, we described its intent or its 
      unaddressed need as well as the associated features and improvements. We 
      conducted a thematic analysis to identify overarching patterns among the 
      innovations, features, and improvements, and compared the timeline of innovations 
      in the DIY space with the timing of similar innovations in the commercial space. 
      RESULTS: We identified and categorized innovations in Nightscout with the most 
      commonly appearing themes of: visualization improvements, equipment improvements, 
      and user experience improvements. Other emerging themes included: Care Portal 
      support, safety, remote monitoring, decision support, international support, 
      artificial pancreas, pushover notifications, and open-source collaboration. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This rapid development of patient-designed DIY innovations driven by 
      unmet needs in the type 1 diabetes community reflects a revolutionary, bottom-up 
      approach to medical innovation. Nightscout users accessed features earlier than 
      if they had waited for commercial products, and they also personalized their 
      tools and devices, empowering them to become the experts of their own care.

AB  - Small-scale and high-performance energy storage devices have drawn tremendous 
      attention with their portable, lightweight, and multi-functionalized features. 
      Here, we present a foldable supercapacitor with affordable flexibility by 
      adopting a developed design and electrode material system as a way to extend 
      usability. Notably, to resolve the limited energy density of conventional 
      capacitors, we successfully synthesize the CoO/NiCo-layered double hydroxide 
      (LDH) core-shell nanostructure on Ni framework as a cathode material. Further, 
      glucose-based activated carbon (GBAC) is utilized for the anode. The CoO/NiCo-LDH 
      electrodes exhibited a high specific capacitance of ∼284.8 mAh g(-1) at 1 A 
      g(-1), and GBAC delivers a high specific capacitance of ∼166 F g(-1) at 1 A 
      g(-1). In the following, the combinatorial integration of these materials enabled 
      the asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) to increase the energy density by enhancing 
      the capacitance and the voltage window, in which a hydrogel-based electrolyte was 
      facilitated for the foldable and wearable capability. The energy density of the 
      ASC device was ∼24.9 Wh kg(-1) at a power density of ∼779.5 W kg(-1) with a 
      voltage window of ∼1.6 V. As demonstrated, a self-powered energy source was 
      demonstrated by a serially connected multi-ASC device with a help of a commercial 
      solar cell, which was employed for powering wearable healthcare monitoring 
      devices, including personal alarms for patients and recording the human body's 
      electrical signals. The present work offers a viable approach to preparing 
      potential candidates for high-performance electrodes of supercapacitors with 
      deformable configurations to extend the powering capability of other electronic 
      devices with physical functionalities used in wearable electronics.

TI  - Performance and Usability Evaluation of an Extended Reality Platform to Monitor 
      Patient's Health during Surgical Procedures.
LID - 10.3390/s22103908 [doi]
LID - 3908
AB  - An extended-reality (XR) platform for real-time monitoring of patients' health 
      during surgical procedures is proposed. The proposed system provides real-time 
      access to a comprehensive set of patients' information, which are made promptly 
      available to the surgical team in the operating room (OR). In particular, the XR 
      platform supports the medical staff by automatically acquiring the patient's 
      vitals from the operating room instrumentation and displaying them in real-time 
      directly on an XR headset. Furthermore, information regarding the patient 
      clinical record is also shown upon request. Finally, the XR-based monitoring 
      platform also allows displaying in XR the video stream coming directly from the 
      endoscope. The innovative aspect of the proposed XR-based monitoring platform 
      lies in the comprehensiveness of the available information, in its modularity and 
      flexibility (in terms of adaption to different sources of data), ease of use, and 
      most importantly, in a reliable communication, which are critical requirements 
      for the healthcare field. To validate the proposed system, experimental tests 
      were conducted using instrumentation typically available in the operating room 
      (i.e., a respiratory ventilator, a patient monitor for intensive care, and an 
      endoscope). The overall results showed (i) an accuracy of the data communication 
      greater than 99 %, along with (ii) an average time response below ms, and (iii) 
      satisfying feedback from the SUS questionnaires filled out by the physicians 
      after intensive use.

TI  - Patient Experience and Feasibility of a Remote Monitoring System in Parkinson's 
      Disease.
LID - 10.1002/mdc3.14169 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Remote monitoring systems have the potential to measure symptoms and 
      treatment effects in people with Parkinson's disease (PwP) in the home 
      environment. However, information about user experience and long-term compliance 
      of such systems in a large group of PwP with relatively severe PD symptoms is 
      lacking. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to gain insight into user experience and 
      long-term compliance of a smartwatch (to be worn 24/7) and an online dashboard to 
      report falls and receive feedback of data. METHODS: We analyzed the data of the 
      "Bringing Parkinson Care Back Home" study, a 1-year observational cohort study in 
      200 PwP with a fall history. User experience, compliance, and reasons for 
      noncompliance were described. Multiple Cox regression models were used to 
      identify determinants of 1-year compliance. RESULTS: We included 200 PwP (mean 
      age: 69 years, 37% women), of whom 116 (58%) completed the 1-year study. The main 
      reasons for dropping out of the study were technical problems (61 of 118 
      reasons). Median wear time of the smartwatch was 17.5 h/day. The online dashboard 
      was used by 77% of participants to report falls. Smartphone possession, shorter 
      disease duration, more severe motor symptoms, and less-severe freezing and 
      balance problems, but not age and gender, were associated with a higher 
      likelihood of 1-year compliance. CONCLUSIONS: The 1-year compliance with this 
      specific smartwatch was moderate, and the user experience was generally good, 
      except battery life and data transfer. Future studies can build on these findings 
      by incorporating a smartwatch that is less prone to technical issues.

AB  - PURPOSE: wearable devices aimed at detecting seizures are rapidly emerging. 
      Continuous collection and optimal data quality are paramount to guarantee the 
      acquisition of clinically meaningful data. It is still unknown how successfully 
      patients can self-manage new technologies and which factors have an impact on 
      this. We assessed the performance of patients managing a wrist-worn device. 
      METHOD: patients wearing a wrist-worn device received a single training session 
      to perform 5 tasks: (1) fitting the device correctly; (2) switching the device on 
      and off; (3) charging the device on a daily basis; (4) pairing the device with a 
      phone or tablet; (5) seeking assistance. Participants were then reviewed every 24 
      h and, at the end of the study, a Wearable technology Self-management Score (WSS) 
      was calculated according to their performance in the different tasks (0-12). The 
      association between WSS, seizure capture, demographics and clinical 
      characteristics was analysed. RESULTS: Thirty patients were included. The mean 
      WSS score was 9.4 ± 2.1 points. The task more often performed inaccurately was 
      pairing the device with a phone or tablet, followed by performing charging 
      procedures. A strong association was found between WSS and seizure capture (p = 
      0.019), with higher scores strongly associated with more seizures captured. A WSS 
      of ≥9 was the minimum value of WSS that allowed the device to record all the 
      seizures. Number of AEDs and illness-perception related factors (perceived 
      disease timeline and personal control) were significantly associated with WSS. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Overall, participants demonstrated good performances in 
      self-managing a wrist-worn device. Digital inequalities may extend to variations 
      in how different individuals feel about their own disease and, consequently, 
      manage the technology. These aspects should be addressed when technological 
      solutions are delivered to users.

TI  - Patient and Clinician Perceptions of the Pulse Oximeter in a Remote Monitoring 
      Setting for COVID-19: Qualitative Study.
PG  - e44540
LID - 10.2196/44540 [doi]
LID - e44540
AB  - BACKGROUND: As a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Sydney Local Health 
      District in New South Wales, Australia, launched the rpavirtual program, the 
      first full-scale virtual hospital in Australia, to remotely monitor and follow up 
      stable patients with COVID-19. As part of the intervention, a pulse oximeter 
      wearable device was delivered to patients to monitor their oxygen saturation 
      levels, a critical indicator of COVID-19 patient deterioration. Understanding 
      users' perceptions toward the device is fundamental to assessing its usability 
      and acceptability and contributing to the effectiveness of the intervention, but 
      no research to date has explored the user experience of the pulse oximeter for 
      remote monitoring in this setting. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the 
      use, performance, and acceptability of the pulse oximeter by clinicians and 
      patients in rpavirtual during COVID-19. METHODS: Semistructured interviews and 
      usability testing were conducted. Stable adult patients with COVID-19 (aged ≥18 
      years) who used the pulse oximeter and were monitored by rpavirtual, and 
      rpavirtual clinicians monitoring these patients were interviewed. Clinicians 
      could be nurses, doctors, or staff who were part of the team that assisted 
      patients with the use of the pulse oximeter. Usability testing was conducted with 
      patients who had the pulse oximeter when they were contacted. Interviews were 
      coded using the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability. Usability testing was 
      conducted using a think-aloud protocol. Data were collected until saturation was 
      reached. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients (average age 51, SD 13 years) and 15 
      clinicians (average age 41, SD 11 years) completed the interview. Eight patients 
      (average age 51, SD 13 years) completed the usability testing. All participants 
      liked the device and thought it was easy to use. They also had a good 
      understanding of how to use the device and the device's purpose. Patients' age 
      and device use-related characteristics (eg, the warmth of hands and hand 
      steadiness) were identified by users as factors negatively impacting the accurate 
      use of the pulse oximeter. CONCLUSIONS: Patients and clinicians had very positive 
      perceptions of the pulse oximeter for COVID-19 remote monitoring, indicating high 
      acceptability and usability of the device. However, factors that may impact the 
      accuracy of the device should be considered when delivering interventions using 
      the pulse oximeter for remote monitoring. Targeted instructions about the use of 
      the device may be necessary for specific populations (eg, older people and 
      patients unfamiliar with technology). Further research should focus on the 
      integration of the pulse oximeter data into electronic medical records for 
      real-time and secure patient monitoring.

TI  - Improving the user experience of televisits and telemonitoring for heart failure 
      patients in less than 6 months: a methodological approach.
PG  - 104717

AB  - BACKGROUND: With the spread of COVID-19, telemedicine solutions became crucial to 
      release continuous and remote assistance to chronic patients. The rapid 
      transition to telemedicine solutions did not allow a complete assessment of the 
      user experience by both patients and medical personnel. Despite the well-known 
      benefits in remote care, the lack of usability evaluation of already existing 
      technologies for the vital signs measurement has emerged. A telemedicine platform 
      must match video communication between patients and the medical staff with the 
      possibility to measure vital parameters. Furthermore, technological assistance 
      may overcome the unfamiliarity with telemedicine and drastically reduce the 
      learning time for both patients and medical personnel. OBJECTIVES: The research 
      work presents a method to improve the user experience of a telemedicine service 
      based on the combination of televisits and telemonitoring with wearable sensors 
      for heart failure patients. Skilled technological staff is proposed by the 
      presented method to lead the learning process of both medical personnel and 
      patients in order to reach a high level of usability in less than 6 months. 
      METHODS: The proposed method is composed of 5 steps: identification of 
      technological staff and end users; selection of the telemedicine platform; design 
      of questionnaires for usability analysis; training of clinicians and patients; 
      final usability evaluation of the telemedicine platform by means of customized 
      satisfaction questionnaires and Post-Study System Usability Questionnaires 
      (PSSUQs). The methodological approach has been tested in collaboration with a 
      heart failure clinic by involving 5 physicians, 5 nurses, 15 heart failure 
      patients, a research engineer and 4 technicians. A platform with 3 wearable 
      sensors has been chosen: a wireless thermometer, a finger pulse-oximeter and an 
      undershirt have been used for the detection of ECG trace. While these devices 
      allowed asynchronous measurements of physiological data, scheduled televisits 
      have been used for direct communication between physicians and patients. RESULTS: 
      Satisfaction questionnaires of patients and clinicians reached respectively 
      65.18% and 65.83%, while PSSUQ scores were respectively 91.73% and 81.70%. Both 
      groups of end users confirmed a good level of usability and their satisfaction 
      about the ease of use and the perceived quality of the instrumentation. Moreover, 
      73% of patients did not require help from caregivers to use the kit of sensors. 
      The results have been reached in 5.5 months according to the aim defined 
      initially. Research engineers have played a crucial role in helping clinicians 
      and patients to improve the user experience with the telemedicine platform. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The high level of usability and satisfaction confirmed that the 
      proposed methodological approach helps to learn the technological features of the 
      telemedicine platforms, which are based on different types of technology, such as 
      web applications, wearable sensors and virtual calls. The positive results with 
      heart failure patients encouraged to plan further research studies by using the 
      designed method with other categories of chronic patients.

      Barriers and facilitators.
PG  - 100188

AB  - BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease 
      with a fast increasing prevalence. Several pharmacological and 
      non-pharmacological interventions are available to alleviate symptoms. Technology 
      can be used to improve the efficiency, accessibility and feasibility of these 
      treatments. Although many technologies are available, only few are actually 
      implemented in daily clinical practice. AIM: Here, we study the barriers and 
      facilitators, as experienced by patients, caregivers and/or healthcare providers, 
      to successful implement technology for PD management. METHODS: We performed a 
      systematic literature search in the PubMed and Embase databases until June 2022. 
      Two independent raters screened the titles, abstracts and full texts on: 1) 
      people with PD; 2) using technology for disease management; 3) qualitative 
      research methods providing patients', caregivers and/or healthcare providers' 
      perspective, and; 4) full text available in English or Dutch. Case studies, 
      reviews and conference abstracts were excluded. RESULTS: We found 5420 unique 
      articles of which 34 were included in this study. Five categories were made: 
      cueing (n = 3), exergaming (n = 3), remote monitoring using wearable sensors 
      (n = 10), telerehabilitation (n = 8) and remote consultation (n = 10). The main 
      barriers reported across categories were unfamiliarity with technology, high 
      costs, technical issues and (motor) symptoms hampering the use of some 
      technologies. Facilitators included good usability, experiencing beneficial 
      effects and feeling safe whilst using the technology. CONCLUSION: Although only 
      few articles presented a qualitative evaluation of technologies, we found some 
      important barriers and facilitators that may help to bridge the gap between the 
      fast developing technological world and actual implementation in day-to-day 
      living with PD.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Objective and continuous monitoring of physical activity over the 
      long-term in the community is perhaps the most important step in the paradigm 
      shift toward evidence-based practice and personalized therapy for successful 
      community integration. With the advancement in technology, physical activity 
      monitors have become the go-to tools for objective and continuous monitoring of 
      everyday physical activity in the community. While these devices are widely used 
      in many patient populations, their use in individuals with acquired brain injury 
      is slowly gaining traction. The first step before using activity monitors in this 
      population is to understand the patient perspective on usability and ease of use 
      of physical activity monitors at different wear locations. However, there are no 
      studies that have looked at the feasibility and patient perspectives on long-term 
      utilization of activity monitors in individuals with acquired brain injury. 
      METHODS: This pilot study aims to fill this gap and understand patient-reported 
      aspects of the feasibility of using physical activity monitors for long-term use 
      in community-dwelling individuals with acquired brain injury. RESULTS: This pilot 
      study found that patients with acquired brain injury faced challenges specific to 
      their functional limitations and that the activity monitors worn on the waist or 
      wrist may be better suited in this population. DISCUSSION: The unique wear 
      location-specific challenges faced by individuals with ABI need to be taken into 
      account when selecting wearable activity monitors for long term use in this 
      population.

TI  - Remote and Long-Term Self-Monitoring of Electroencephalographic and Noninvasive 
      Measurable Variables at Home in Patients With Epilepsy (EEG@HOME): Protocol for 
      an Observational Study.
PG  - e25309
LID - 10.2196/25309 [doi]
LID - e25309
AB  - BACKGROUND: Epileptic seizures are spontaneous events that severely affect the 
      lives of patients due to their recurrence and unpredictability. The integration 
      of new wearable and mobile technologies to collect electroencephalographic (EEG) 
      and extracerebral signals in a portable system might be the solution to 
      prospectively identify times of seizure occurrence or propensity. The 
      performances of several seizure detection devices have been assessed by validated 
      studies, and patient perspectives on wearables have been explored to better match 
      their needs. Despite this, there is a major gap in the literature on long-term, 
      real-life acceptability and performance of mobile technology essential to 
      managing chronic disorders such as epilepsy. OBJECTIVE: EEG@HOME is an 
      observational, nonrandomized, noninterventional study that aims to develop a new 
      feasible procedure that allows people with epilepsy to independently, 
      continuously, and safely acquire noninvasive variables at home. The data 
      collected will be analyzed to develop a general model to predict periods of 
      increased seizure risk. METHODS: A total of 12 adults with a diagnosis of 
      pharmaco-resistant epilepsy and at least 20 seizures per year will be recruited 
      at King's College Hospital, London. Participants will be asked to self-apply an 
      easy and portable EEG recording system (ANT Neuro) to record scalp EEG at home 
      twice daily. From each serial EEG recording, brain network ictogenicity (BNI), a 
      new biomarker of the propensity of the brain to develop seizures, will be 
      extracted. A noninvasive wrist-worn device (Fitbit Charge 3; Fitbit Inc) will be 
      used to collect non-EEG biosignals (heart rate, sleep quality index, and steps), 
      and a smartphone app (Seer app; Seer Medical) will be used to collect data 
      related to seizure occurrence, medication taken, sleep quality, stress, and mood. 
      All data will be collected continuously for 6 months. Standardized questionnaires 
      (the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire and System Usability Scale) will 
      be completed to assess the acceptability and feasibility of the procedure. BNI, 
      continuous wrist-worn sensor biosignals, and electronic survey data will be 
      correlated with seizure occurrence as reported in the diary to investigate their 
      potential values as biomarkers of seizure risk. RESULTS: The EEG@HOME project 
      received funding from Epilepsy Research UK in 2018 and was approved by the 
      Bromley Research Ethics Committee in March 2020. The first participants were 
      enrolled in October 2020, and we expect to publish the first results by the end 
      of 2022. CONCLUSIONS: With the EEG@HOME study, we aim to take advantage of new 
      advances in remote monitoring technology, including self-applied EEG, to 
      investigate the feasibility of long-term disease self-monitoring. Further, we 
      hope our study will bring new insights into noninvasively collected personalized 
      risk factors of seizure occurrence and seizure propensity that may help to 
      mitigate one of the most difficult aspects of refractory epilepsy: the 
      unpredictability of seizure occurrence. INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT

PG  - e28873

LID - e28873
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic lung disorders like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
      (COPD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) are characterized by 
      exacerbations. They are unpleasant for patients and sometimes severe enough to 
      cause hospital admission and death. Moreover, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 
      vulnerable populations with these disorders are at high risk, and their routine 
      care cannot be done properly. Remote monitoring offers a low cost and safe 
      solution for gaining visibility into the health of people in their daily lives, 
      making it useful for vulnerable populations. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective is 
      to assess the feasibility and acceptability of remote monitoring using wearables 
      and mobile phones in patients with pulmonary diseases. The secondary objective is 
      to provide power calculations for future studies centered around understanding 
      the number of exacerbations according to sample size and duration. METHODS: 
      Twenty participants will be recruited in each of three cohorts (COPD, IPF, and 
      posthospitalization COVID). Data collection will be done remotely using the 
      RADAR-Base (Remote Assessment of Disease And Relapse) mobile health (mHealth) 
      platform for different devices, including Garmin wearable devices and smart 
      spirometers, mobile app questionnaires, surveys, and finger pulse oximeters. 
      Passive data include wearable-derived continuous heart rate, oxygen saturation, 
      respiration rate, activity, and sleep. Active data include disease-specific 
      patient-reported outcome measures, mental health questionnaires, and symptom 
      tracking to track disease trajectory. Analyses will assess the feasibility of 
      lung disorder remote monitoring (including data quality, data completeness, 
      system usability, and system acceptability). We will attempt to explore disease 
      trajectory, patient stratification, and identification of acute clinical events 
      such as exacerbations. A key aspect is understanding the potential of real-time 
      data collection. We will simulate an intervention to acquire responses at the 
      time of the event to assess model performance for exacerbation identification. 
      RESULTS: The Remote Assessment of Lung Disease and Impact on Physical and Mental 
      Health (RALPMH) study provides a unique opportunity to assess the use of remote 
      monitoring in the evaluation of lung disorders. The study started in the middle 
      of June 2021. The data collection apparatus, questionnaires, and wearable 
      integrations were setup and tested by the clinical teams prior to the start of 
      recruitment. While recruitment is ongoing, real-time exacerbation identification 
      models are currently being constructed. The models will be pretrained daily on 
      data of previous days, but the inference will be run in real time. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The RALPMH study will provide a reference infrastructure for remote monitoring of 
      lung diseases. It specifically involves information regarding the feasibility and 
      acceptability of remote monitoring and the potential of real-time data collection 
      and analysis in the context of chronic lung disorders. It will help plan and 
      inform decisions in future studies in the area of respiratory health. TRIAL

TI  - Introducing the Pi-CON Methodology to Overcome Usability Deficits during Remote 
      Patient Monitoring.
LID - 10.3390/s24072260 [doi]
LID - 2260
AB  - The adoption of telehealth has soared, and with that the acceptance of Remote 
      Patient Monitoring (RPM) and virtual care. A review of the literature 
      illustrates, however, that poor device usability can impact the generated data 
      when using Patient-Generated Health Data (PGHD) devices, such as wearables or 
      home use medical devices, when used outside a health facility. The Pi-CON 
      methodology is introduced to overcome these challenges and guide the definition 
      of user-friendly and intuitive devices in the future. Pi-CON stands for passive, 
      continuous, and non-contact, and describes the ability to acquire health data, 
      such as vital signs, continuously and passively with limited user interaction and 
      without attaching any sensors to the patient. The paper highlights the advantages 
      of Pi-CON by leveraging various sensors and techniques, such as radar, remote 
      photoplethysmography, and infrared. It illustrates potential concerns and 
      discusses future applications Pi-CON could be used for, including gait and fall 
      monitoring by installing an omnipresent sensor based on the Pi-CON methodology. 
      This would allow automatic data collection once a person is recognized, and could 
      be extended with an integrated gateway so multiple cameras could be installed to 
      enable data feeds to a cloud-based interface, allowing clinicians and family 
      members to monitor patient health status remotely at any time.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an increasingly prevalent chronic, 
      autoimmune, and inflammatory central nervous system illness, whose common 
      symptoms undermine the quality of life of patients and their families. Recent 
      technical breakthroughs potentially offer continuous, reliable, sensitive, and 
      objective remote monitoring solutions for healthcare. Wearables can be useful for 
      evaluating falls, fatigue, sedentary behavior, exercise, and sleep quality in 
      people with MS (PwMS). OBJECTIVE: This scoping review of relevant literature 
      explores studies investigating the perceptions of patients and healthcare 
      professionals (HCPs) about the use of wearable technologies in the management of 
      MS. METHODS: The Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for scoping reviews was 
      used. The search strategy was applied to the databases, MEDLINE via Ovid, Embase, 
      APA PsycInfo, and CINAHL. Further searches were performed in IEEE, Scopus, and 
      Web of Science. The review considered studies reporting quantitative or 
      qualitative data on perceptions and experiences of PwMS and HCPs concerning 
      wearables' usability, satisfaction, barriers, and facilitators. RESULTS: 10 
      studies were included in this review. Wearables' usefulness and accessibility, 
      ease of use, awareness, and motivational tool potential were patient-perceived 
      facilitators of use. Barriers related to anxiety and frustration, complexity, and 
      the design of wearables. Perceived usefulness and system requirements are 
      identified as facilitators of using wearables by HCPs, while data security 
      concerns and fears of increased workload and limited effectiveness in the care 
      plan are identified as barriers to use wearables. CONCLUSIONS: This review 
      contributes to our understanding of the benefits of wearable technologies in MS 
      by exploring perceptions of both PwMS and HCPs. The scoping review provided a 
      broad overview of facilitators and barriers to wearable use in MS. There is a 
      need for further studies underlined with sound theoretical frameworks to provide 
      a robust evidence-base for the optimal use of wearables to empower healthcare 
      users and providers.

TI  - Exploring the Feasibility and Usability of Smartphones for Monitoring Physical 
      Activity in Orthopedic Patients: Prospective Observational Study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Smartphones are often equipped with inertial sensors that measure 
      individuals' physical activity (PA). However, their role in remote monitoring of 
      the patients' PAs in telemedicine needs to be adequately explored. OBJECTIVE: 
      This study aimed to explore the correlation between a participant's actual daily 
      step counts and the daily step counts reported by their smartphone. In addition, 
      we inquired about the usability of smartphones for collecting PA data. METHODS: 
      This prospective observational study was conducted among patients undergoing 
      lower limb orthopedic surgery and a group of nonpatients as control. The data 
      from the patients were collected from 2 weeks before surgery until 4 weeks after 
      the surgery, whereas the data collection period for the nonpatients was 2 weeks. 
      The participant's daily step count was recorded by PA trackers worn 24/7. In 
      addition, a smartphone app collected the number of daily steps registered by the 
      participants' smartphones. We compared the cross-correlation between the daily 
      steps time series obtained from the smartphones and PA trackers in different 
      groups of participants. We also used mixed modeling to estimate the total number 
      of steps, using smartphone step counts and the characteristics of the patients as 
      independent variables. The System Usability Scale was used to evaluate the 
      participants' experience with the smartphone app and the PA tracker. RESULTS: 
      Overall, 1067 days of data were collected from 21 patients (n=11, 52% female 
      patients) and 10 nonpatients (n=6, 60% female patients). The median 
      cross-correlation coefficient on the same day was 0.70 (IQR 0.53-0.83). The 
      correlation in the nonpatient group was slightly higher than that in the patient 
      group (median 0.74, IQR 0.60-0.90 and median 0.69, IQR 0.52-0.81, respectively). 
      The likelihood ratio tests on the models fitted by mixed effects methods 
      demonstrated that the smartphone step count was positively correlated with the PA 
      tracker's total number of steps (χ(2)(1)=34.7, P<.001). In addition, the median 
      usability score for the smartphone app was 78 (IQR 73-88) compared with median 73 
      (IQR 68-80) for the PA tracker. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the ubiquity, 
      convenience, and practicality of smartphones, the high correlation between the 
      smartphones and the total daily step count time series highlights the potential 
      usefulness of smartphones in detecting changes in the number of steps in remote 
      monitoring of a patient's PA.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder which 
      requires complex medication regimens to mitigate motor symptoms. The use of 
      digital health technology systems (DHTSs) to collect mobility and medication data 
      provides an opportunity to objectively quantify the effect of medication on motor 
      performance during day-to-day activities. This insight could inform clinical 
      decision-making, personalise care, and aid self-management. This study 
      investigates the feasibility and usability of a multi-component DHTS to remotely 
      assess self-reported medication adherence and monitor mobility in people with 
      Parkinson's (PwP). METHODS: Thirty participants with PD [Hoehn and Yahr stage I 
      (n = 1) and II (n = 29)] were recruited for this cross-sectional study. 
      Participants were required to wear, and where appropriate, interact with a DHTS 
      (smartwatch, inertial measurement unit, and smartphone) for seven consecutive 
      days to assess medication adherence and monitor digital mobility outcomes and 
      contextual factors. Participants reported their daily motor complications [motor 
      fluctuations and dyskinesias (i.e., involuntary movements)] in a diary. Following 
      the monitoring period, participants completed a questionnaire to gauge the 
      usability of the DHTS. Feasibility was assessed through the percentage of data 
      collected, and usability through analysis of qualitative questionnaire feedback. 
      RESULTS: Adherence to each device exceeded 70% and ranged from 73 to 97%. 
      Overall, the DHTS was well tolerated with 17/30 participants giving a score > 75% 
      [average score for these participants = 89%, from 0 (worst) to 100 (best)] for 
      its usability. Usability of the DHTS was significantly associated with age (ρ = 
      -0.560, BCa 95% CI [-0.791, -0.207]). This study identified means to improve 
      usability of the DHTS by addressing technical and design issues of the 
      smartwatch. Feasibility, usability and acceptability were identified as key 
      themes from PwP qualitative feedback on the DHTS. CONCLUSION: This study 
      highlighted the feasibility and usability of our integrated DHTS to remotely 
      assess medication adherence and monitor mobility in people with mild-to-moderate 
      Parkinson's disease. Further work is necessary to determine whether this DHTS can 
      be implemented for clinical decision-making to optimise management of PwP.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of wearable technology offers a promising home-based 
      self-directed option for upper limb training. Although product usability is a 
      crucial aspect of users' acceptance of a wearable device, usability studies in 
      wearable devices are rare, with most studies focusing primarily on clinical 
      validity. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the usability of a wristwatch 
      device called "Smart reminder" for home-based upper limb telerehabilitation for 
      persons with stroke. METHODS: Eleven stroke participants used the proposed 
      wristwatch for at least two weeks and underwent a home-based telerehabilitation 
      program. A mixed-methods design was used to explore the usability of the 
      wristwatch. Quantitative data were collected through the System Usability Scale 
      (SUS) questionnaire, and the participants' rate of therapy compliance (gathered 
      from the device) was reported descriptively. In addition, qualitative data were 
      collected through semi-structured interviews with the participants and were 
      analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that the 
      usability of the proposed wristwatch and telerehabilitation system was rated 
      highly by the participants, with a high SUS mean score of 84.3 (12.3) and high 
      therapy compliance rate (mean  =  91%). Qualitatively, all participants reported 
      positive experiences with the wristwatch and indicated keenness to use it again. 
      Participants reported physical improvements and felt motivated to exercise after 
      using the wristwatch. They found the device easy and convenient and appreciated 
      the remote monitoring function. Meanwhile, they highlighted critical 
      considerations for the design of the device and program, including technical 
      support, a wearable design of the device, graded exercise content according to 
      ability, and flexibility in exercise schedules. Finally, they suggested that an 
      interim review with the therapist on their progress might help them continue 
      using the wristwatch. CONCLUSIONS: This study's results supported the proposed 
      wearable device's usability and showed strong acceptance by the participants for 
      using it as a home-based upper limb telerehabilitation intervention.

AB  - BACKGROUND: During the 30-day period prior to initiating dialysis, there is a 
      10-fold rise in emergency department visits and hospitalizations related to 
      kidney failure. OBJECTIVE: The Virtual Ward Incorporating Electronic Wearables 
      (VIEWER) trial implemented a home telemonitoring system to track changes in 
      patients' vitals and assess their adherence and the acceptability of 
      telemonitoring in a chronic kidney disease (CKD) population. DESIGN: A pilot 
      prospective clinical trial using a mixed methods approach was performed. SETTING: 
      The research was conducted in Winnipeg, Manitoba. PARTICIPANTS: There were 2 
      phases: Phase 1 was a 2-week-long pilot trial consisting of 10 participants. 
      Phase 2 was a 3-month-long trial with a total of 26 participants. Patients with 
      an estimated glomerular filtration rate <15 and a >40% risk of beginning dialysis 
      in the next 2 years according to the kidney failure risk equation were eligible 
      to participate in the study. METHODS: The primary quantitative outcome was 
      adherence, defined as the proportion of daily self-assessments completed using 
      VIEWER over the follow-up period. The usability and acceptability of VIEWER was 
      assessed qualitatively at the end of the trial through structured questionnaires 
      and focus groups. RESULTS: Phase 1 participants (n = 10) had a median adherence 
      of 77.17% for the 2-week observation period. Phase 2 participants (n = 26) showed 
      a lower median adherence of 36% for the 3-month period. Focus group participants 
      (n = 11) identified many positive aspects of VIEWER, including increased 
      awareness and empowerment over health, simplicity of the data platform, and the 
      ability to show clinical staff their health trends. Some challenges identified 
      with VIEWER were connectivity issues with the Bluetooth, perceived inconvenience, 
      and negative thoughts toward their health. LIMITATIONS: Limitations of the study 
      include a small sample size, which limited our ability to measure quantitative 
      outcomes. In addition, patients agreeing to participate in any trial are 
      generally more highly motivated and engaged in their care than those declining 
      participation. Therefore, our results may not be generalizable to individuals who 
      are not interested in self-management of their health. CONCLUSION: Our results 
      suggest that home telemonitoring in patients with advanced CKD is feasible using 
      a CKD-specific platform like VIEWER. We anticipate that improved functionality 
      with incorporation of feedback from this study will result in greater long-term 
      adherence. A future randomized clinical trial is planned.

TI  - Users' Perceptions Toward mHealth Technologies for Health and Well-being 
      Monitoring in Pregnancy Care: Qualitative Interview Study.
PG  - e28628
LID - 10.2196/28628 [doi]
LID - e28628
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mobile health (mHealth) technologies, such as wearable sensors, smart 
      health devices, and mobile apps, that are capable of supporting pregnancy care 
      are emerging. Although mHealth could be used to facilitate the tracking of health 
      changes during pregnancy, challenges remain in data collection compliance and 
      technology engagement among pregnant women. Understanding the interests, 
      preferences, and requirements of pregnant women and those of clinicians is needed 
      when designing and introducing mHealth solutions for supporting pregnant women's 
      monitoring of health and risk factors throughout their pregnancy journey. 
      OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand clinicians' and pregnant women's 
      perceptions on the potential use of mHealth, including factors that may influence 
      their engagement with mHealth technologies and the implications for technology 
      design and implementation. METHODS: A qualitative study using semistructured 
      interviews was conducted with 4 pregnant women, 4 postnatal women, and 13 
      clinicians working in perinatal care. RESULTS: Clinicians perceived the potential 
      benefit of mHealth in supporting different levels of health and well-being 
      monitoring, risk assessment, and care provision in pregnancy care. Most pregnant 
      and postnatal female participants were open to the use of wearables and health 
      monitoring devices and were more likely to use these technologies if they knew 
      that clinicians were monitoring their data. Although it was acknowledged that 
      some pregnancy-related medical conditions are suitable for an mHealth model of 
      remote monitoring, the clinical and technical challenges in the introduction of 
      mHealth for pregnancy care were also identified. Incorporating appropriate health 
      and well-being measures, intelligently detecting any abnormalities, and providing 
      tailored information for pregnant women were the critical aspects, whereas 
      usability and data privacy were among the main concerns of the participants. 
      Moreover, this study highlighted the challenges of engaging pregnant women in 
      longitudinal mHealth monitoring, the additional work required for clinicians to 
      monitor the data, and the need for an evidence-based technical solution. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Clinical, technical, and practical factors associated with the use 
      of mHealth to monitor health and well-being in pregnant women need to be 
      considered during the design and feasibility evaluation stages. Technical 
      solutions and appropriate strategies for motivating pregnant women are critical 
      to supporting their long-term data collection compliance and engagement with 
      mHealth technology during pregnancy.

TI  - Remote Monitoring Telemedicine (REMOTE) Platform for Patients With Anxiety 
      Symptoms and Alcohol Use Disorder: Protocol for a Case-Control Study.
PG  - e16964
LID - 10.2196/16964 [doi]
LID - e16964
AB  - BACKGROUND: Monitoring mental health outcomes has traditionally been based on 
      heuristic decisions, often based on scarce, subjective evidence, making the 
      clinical decisions made by professionals, as well as the monitoring of these 
      diseases, subject to flaws. However, the digital phenotype, which refers to the 
      analysis of data collected by measuring human behavior with mobile sensors and 
      smart bracelets, is a promising tool for filling this gap in current clinical 
      practice. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study are to develop the digital 
      phenotyping of patients with alcohol use disorder and anxiety symptoms using data 
      collected from a mobile device (ie, smartphone) and a wearable sensor (ie, 
      Fitbit) and to analyze usability and patient satisfaction with the data 
      collection service provided by the app. METHODS: We propose to conduct a study 
      among a group of 60 participants split into two subgroups-experimental and 
      control-of 30 participants each. The experimental group will be recruited by 
      physicians from the Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, and the control group will be 
      recruited on a volunteer basis through fliers and social media. All participants 
      will go through pretraining to ensure technological capability and understanding 
      of tasks, then each participant will download the HumanITcare app and will be 
      given a wearable sensor (ie, Fitbit). Throughout the 4-month period, participants 
      will be monitored on a range of factors, including sleep cycle, heart rate, 
      movement patterns, and sociability. All data from the wearable sensors and the 
      mobile devices will be saved and sent to the HumanITcare server. Participants 
      will be asked to complete weekly questionnaires about anxiety, depression, and 
      alcohol use disorder symptoms. Research assistants will ensure timely responses. 
      The data from both sensors will then be compared to the questionnaire responses 
      to determine how accurately the devices can predict the same symptoms. RESULTS: 
      The recruitment phase was completed in November 2019 and all the data were 
      collected by the end of December 2019. Data are being processed; this process is 
      expected to be completed by October 2020. CONCLUSIONS: This study was created and 
      conducted as a pilot study with the Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, with the 
      purpose of exploring the feasibility of our approach. The study is focused on 
      patients diagnosed with anxiety and alcohol use disorder, but participants were 
      also monitored for depressive symptoms throughout the trial, although these were 
      not part of the initial inclusion criteria. A limitation to our study was the 
      exclusive use of Android smartphones over iOS devices; this could result in a 
      potential selection bias, due to the accessibility and affordability of Android 
      phones as opposed to iOS-based phones. Another limitation might be that reviews 
      of usability and satisfaction could be confounded by factors such as age and 
      familiarity. An additional function that we might add in future studies is the 
      ability for patients to manage their own data. INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Vertigo, dizziness, gaze instability and disequilibrium are highly 
      prevalent in people with MS (PwMS) and head movement induced dizziness is 
      commonly reported. Vestibular physical therapy (VPT) is a specialised, 
      non-invasive and effective therapy for these problems but usually involves travel 
      for the person to a specialist center with both personal and carbon costs. The 
      use of wearable sensors to track head movement and smartphone applications to 
      deliver and track programs has potential to improve VPT in MS. METHODS: This 
      study investigated the usability and effects of a commercially available digital 
      VPT system (wearable head sensor, smartphone app and clinician software) to 
      deliver VPT to PwMS. A pre/post treatment design was employed and the primary 
      outcome was the System Usability Scale (SUS). Other patient reported outcomes 
      were the Service User Acceptability Questionnaire (SUTAQ), the Patient Enablement 
      Instrument (PEI) and the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI). Physical outcomes 
      measurements included Mini-BESTest (MB), Modified Dynamic Gait Index (mDGI), Gait 
      Speed (GS), Dynamic Visual Acuity (DVA) and head kinematics and symptoms during 
      exercise. RESULTS: Sixteen PwMS (14 female), mean age 44(±14) years were 
      recruited to the study and twelve completed VPT. Mean adherence to exercise, 
      measured digitally was 60% (±18.4). SUS scores were high at 81 (±14) and SUTAQ 
      scores also demonstrated high levels of satisfaction and acceptability of the 
      system. Statistically significant improvements in MB (mean change 2.25; 
      p = 0.004), mDGI (median change 1.00; p = 0.008), DVA (median change -1.00; 
      p = 0.004) were found. Head frequencies significantly improved with concurrent 
      decreased intensity of dizziness during head movements (mean change across 4 gaze 
      stabilization exercises was 23 beats per minute; p < 0.05). Non-significant 
      improvements were seen in DHI (p = 0.07) and GS (p = 0.15). 64.5% of follow up 
      visits were conducted remotely (video or phone), facilitated by the system. 
      DISCUSSION: This study had two main outcomes and benefits for PwMS. Firstly, we 
      showed that the system used was both acceptable and could be used by PwMS. 
      Secondly, we demonstrated an improvement in a range of dizziness, balance and 
      gait metrics with remotely delivered care. This system has the potential to 
      positively impact on MS physiotherapy service provision with the potential to 
      deliver effective remote care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite continuous advancement in the field, heart failure (HF) 
      remains the leading cause of hospitalization among the elderly and the overall 
      first cause of hospital readmission in developed countries. Implantable 
      hemodynamic monitoring is being tested to anticipate the clinical exacerbation 
      onset, potentially preventing an emergent acute decompensation. To date, only 
      pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) sensor received the approval to be implanted in 
      symptomatic heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction. However, PAP's 
      indirect estimation of left ventricular filling pressure can be inaccurate in 
      some contexts. METHODS: The VECTOR-HF study (NCT03775161) is examining the 
      safety, usability and performance of the V-LAP system, a latest-generation device 
      capable of continuously monitoring left atrial pressure (LAP). In our center, 
      five advanced HF patients have been enrolled. After confirmation of the 
      transmitted data reliability, LAP trends and waveforms have guided therapy 
      optimization. The aim of this work is to share clinical insights from our center 
      preliminary experience with V-LAP application. RESULTS: Over a median follow-up 
      time of 18 months, LAP-based therapy optimization managed to reduce intracardiac 
      pressure over time and no hospital readmission occurred. This result was 
      paralleled by an improvement in both functional capacity (6MWT distance 352.5 ± 
      86.2 meters at baseline to 441.2 ± 125.2 meters at last follow-up) and quality of 
      life indicators (KCCQ overall score 63.82 ± 16.36 vs. 81.92 ± 9.63; clinical 
      score 68.47 ± 19.48 vs. 83.70 ± 15.58). CONCLUSION: Preliminary evidence from 
      V-LAP application at our institution support a promising efficacy. However, 
      further study is needed to confirm the technical reliability of the device and to 
      exploit the clinical benefit of left-sided hemodynamic remote monitoring.

TI  - Evaluating a Remote Monitoring Program for Respiratory Diseases: Prospective 
      Observational Study.
PG  - e51507

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic respiratory diseases and those in the 
      postdischarge period following hospitalization because of COVID-19 are 
      particularly vulnerable, and little is known about the changes in their symptoms 
      and physiological parameters. Continuous remote monitoring of physiological 
      parameters and symptom changes offers the potential for timely intervention, 
      improved patient outcomes, and reduced health care costs. OBJECTIVE: This study 
      investigated whether a real-time multimodal program using commercially available 
      wearable technology, home-based Bluetooth-enabled spirometers, finger pulse 
      oximeters, and smartphone apps is feasible and acceptable for patients with 
      chronic respiratory diseases, as well as the value of low-burden, long-term 
      passive data collection. METHODS: In a 3-arm prospective observational cohort 
      feasibility study, we recruited 60 patients from the Royal Free Hospital and 
      University College Hospital. These patients had been diagnosed with interstitial 
      lung disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or post-COVID-19 condition 
      (n=20 per group) and were followed for 180 days. This study used a comprehensive 
      remote monitoring system designed to provide real-time and relevant data for both 
      patients and clinicians. Data were collected using REDCap (Research Electronic 
      Data Capture; Vanderbilt University) periodic surveys, Remote Assessment of 
      Disease and Relapses-base active app questionnaires, wearables, finger pulse 
      oximeters, smartphone apps, and Bluetooth home-based spirometry. The feasibility 
      of remote monitoring was measured through adherence to the protocol, engagement 
      during the follow-up period, retention rate, acceptability, and data integrity. 
      RESULTS: Lowest-burden passive data collection methods, via wearables, 
      demonstrated superior adherence, engagement, and retention compared with active 
      data collection methods, with an average wearable use of 18.66 (SD 4.69) hours 
      daily (77.8% of the day), 123.91 (SD 33.73) hours weekly (72.6% of the week), and 
      463.82 (SD 156.70) hours monthly (64.4% of the month). Highest-burden spirometry 
      tasks and high-burden active app tasks had the lowest adherence, engagement, and 
      retention, followed by low-burden questionnaires. Spirometry and active 
      questionnaires had the lowest retention at 0.5 survival probability, indicating 
      that they were the most burdensome. Adherence to and quality of home spirometry 
      were analyzed; of the 7200 sessions requested, 4248 (59%) were performed. Of 
      these, 90.3% (3836/4248) were of acceptable quality according to American 
      Thoracic Society grading. Inclusion of protocol holidays improved retention 
      measures. The technologies used were generally well received. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      findings provide evidence supporting the feasibility and acceptability of remote 
      monitoring for capturing both subjective and objective data from various sources 
      for respiratory diseases. The high engagement level observed with passively 
      collected data suggests the potential of wearables for long-term, user-friendly 
      remote monitoring in respiratory disease management. The unique piloting of 
      certain features such as protocol holidays, alert notifications for missing data, 
      and flexible support from the study team provides a reference for future studies 
      in this field. INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID):

TI  - Neural Network-Enabled Flexible Pressure and Temperature Sensor with 
      Honeycomb-like Architecture for Voice Recognition.
LID - 10.3390/s22030759 [doi]
LID - 759
AB  - Flexible pressure sensors have been studied as wearable voice-recognition devices 
      to be utilized in human-machine interaction. However, the development of highly 
      sensitive, skin-attachable, and comfortable sensing devices to achieve clear 
      voice detection remains a considerable challenge. Herein, we present a wearable 
      and flexible pressure and temperature sensor with a sensitive response to 
      vibration, which can accurately recognize the human voice by combing with the 
      artificial neural network. The device consists of a polyethylene terephthalate 
      (PET) printed with a silver electrode, a filament-microstructured 
      polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) film embedded with single-walled carbon nanotubes and 
      a polyimide (PI) film sputtered with a patterned Ti/Pt thermistor strip. The 
      developed pressure sensor exhibited a pressure sensitivity of 0.398 kPa-1 in the 
      low-pressure regime, and the fabricated temperature sensor shows a desirable 
      temperature coefficient of resistance of 0.13% ∘C in the range of 25 ∘C to 105 
      ∘C. Through training and testing the neural network model with the waveform data 
      of the sensor obtained from human pronunciation, the vocal fold vibrations of 
      different words can be successfully recognized, and the total recognition 
      accuracy rate can reach 93.4%. Our results suggest that the fabricated sensor has 
      substantial potential for application in the human-computer interface fields, 
      such as voice control, vocal healthcare monitoring, and voice authentication.

TI  - Feasibility of a Multimodal Telemedical Intervention for Patients with 
      Parkinson's Disease-A Pilot Study.

AB  - Symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) can be controlled well, but treatment often 
      requires expert judgment. Telemedicine and sensor-based assessments can allow 
      physicians to better observe the evolvement of symptoms over time, in particular 
      with motor fluctuations. In addition, they potentially allow less frequent visits 
      to the expert's office and facilitate care in rural areas. A variety of systems 
      with different strengths and shortcomings has been investigated in recent years. 
      We designed a multimodal telehealth intervention (TelePark) to mitigate the 
      shortcomings of individual systems and assessed the feasibility of our approach 
      in 12 patients with PD over 12 weeks in preparation for a larger randomized 
      controlled trial. TelePark uses video visits, a smartphone app, a camera system, 
      and wearable sensors. Structured training included setting up the equipment in 
      patients' homes and group-based online training. Usability was assessed by 
      questionnaires and semi-standardized telephone interviews. Overall, 11 out of 12 
      patients completed the trial (5 female, 6 male). Mean age was 65 years, mean 
      disease duration 7 years, mean MoCA score 27. Adherence was stable throughout the 
      study and 79% for a short questionnaire administered every second day, 62% for 
      medication confirmation, and 33% for an electronic Hauser diary. Quality of life 
      did not change in the course of the study, and a larger cohort will be required 
      to determine the effect on motor symptoms. Interviews with trial participants 
      identified motivations to use such systems and areas for improvements. These 
      insights can be helpful in designing similar trials.

TI  - Cross-Talk Signal Free Recyclable Thermoplastic Polyurethane/Graphene-Based 
      Strain and Pressure Sensor for Monitoring Human Motions.
PG  - 17279-17292
LID - 10.1021/acsami.3c01364 [doi]
AB  - Developing a sensor that can read out cross-talk free signals while determining 
      various active physiological parameters is demanding in the field of 
      point-of-care applications. While there are a few examples of non-flexible 
      sensors available, the management of electronic waste generated from such sensors 
      is critical. Most of such available sensors are rigid in form factor and hence 
      limit their usability in healthcare monitoring due to their poor conformity to 
      human skin. Combining these facets, studies on the development of a recyclable 
      cross-talk free flexible sensor for monitoring human motions and active 
      parameters are far and few. In this work, we report on the development of a 
      recyclable flexible sensor that can provide accurate data for detecting small 
      changes in strain as well as pressure. The developed sensor could decipher the 
      signals individually responsible due to strain as well as pressure. Hence, it can 
      deliver a cross-talk free output. Thermoplastic polyurethane and graphene were 
      selected as the model system. The thermoplastic polyurethane/graphene sensor 
      exhibited a tensile strain sensitivity of GF ≃ 3.375 for 0-100% strain and 10.551 
      for 100-150% strain and a pressure sensitivity of ∼-0.25 kPa(-1). We demonstrate 
      the applicability of the strain sensor for monitoring a variety of human motions 
      ranging from a very small strain of eye blinking to a large strain of elbow 
      bending with unambiguous peaks and a very fast response and recovery time of 165 
      ms. The signals received are mostly electrical hysteresis free. To confirm the 
      recyclability, the developed sensor was recycled up to three times. Marginal 
      decrement in the sensitivity was noted with recycling without compromising the 
      sensing capabilities. These findings promise to open up a new avenue for 
      developing flexible sensors with lesser carbon footprints.

TI  - Smart Offloading Boot System for Remote Patient Monitoring: Toward Adherence 
      Reinforcement and Proper Physical Activity Prescription for Diabetic Foot Ulcer 
      Patients.
PG  - 42-51
LID - 10.1177/19322968211070850 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A critical factor in healing diabetic foot ulcers is patient 
      adherence to offloading devices. We tested a smart offloading boot (SmartBoot) 
      combined with a smartwatch app and cloud dashboard to remotely monitor patient 
      adherence and activity. In addition, the impact of SmartBoot on balance, gait, 
      and user experience was investigated. METHODS: Fourteen volunteers (31.6±8.7 
      years; 64% female) performed natural activities (eg, sitting, standing, walking) 
      with and without the SmartBoot for approximately 30 minutes. All participants 
      completed balance tests, 10-meter walking tests at slow, normal, and fast pace 
      while wearing the SmartBoot, and a user experience questionnaire. The accuracy of 
      real-time adherence reporting was assessed by comparing the SmartBoot and staff 
      observation. Center of mass (COM) sway and step counts were measured using a 
      validated wearable system. RESULTS: Average sensitivity, specificity, and 
      accuracy for adherence and non-adherence were 90.6%, 88.0%, and 89.3%, 
      respectively. The COM sway area was significantly smaller with the SmartBoot than 
      without the SmartBoot regardless of test condition. Step count error was 4.4% for 
      slow waking, 36.2% for normal walking, 16.0% for fast walking. Most participants 
      agreed that the SmartBoot is easy to use, relatively comfortable, nonintrusive, 
      and innovative. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first smart offloading 
      system that enables remote patient monitoring and real-time adherence and 
      activity reporting. The SmartBoot enhanced balance performance, likely due to 
      somatosensory feedback. Questionnaire results highlight SmartBoot's technical and 
      clinical potential. Future studies warrant clinical validation of real-time 
      non-adherence alerting to improve wound healing outcomes in people with diabetic 
      foot ulcers.

TI  - Safety, usability, and performance of a wireless left atrial pressure monitoring 
      system in patients with heart failure: the VECTOR-HF trial.
PG  - 902-911
LID - 10.1002/ejhf.2869 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: In heart failure (HF), implantable haemodynamic monitoring devices have 
      been shown to optimize therapy, anticipating clinical decompensation and 
      preventing hospitalization. Direct left-sided haemodynamic sensors offer 
      theoretical benefits beyond pulmonary artery pressure monitoring systems. We 
      evaluated the safety, usability, and performance of a novel left atrial pressure 
      (LAP) monitoring system in HF patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: The VECTOR-HF study 
      (NCT03775161) was a first-in-human, prospective, multicentre, single-arm, 
      clinical trial enrolling 30 patients with HF. The device consisted of an 
      interatrial positioned leadless sensor, able to transmit LAP data wirelessly. 
      After 3 months, a right heart catheterization was performed to correlate mean 
      pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) with simultaneous mean LAP obtained 
      from the device. Remote LAP measurements were then used to guide patient 
      management. The miniaturized device was successfully implanted in all 30 
      patients, without acute major adverse cardiac and neurological events (MACNE). At 
      3 months, freedom from short-term MACNE was 97%. Agreement between 
      sensor-calculated LAP and PCWP was consistent, with a mean difference of 
      -0.22 ± 4.92 mmHg, the correlation coefficient and the Lin's concordance 
      correlation coefficient values were equal to 0.79 (p < 0.0001) and 0.776 (95% 
      confidence interval 0.582-0.886), respectively. Preliminary experience with 
      V-LAP-based HF management was associated with significant improvements in New 
      York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class (32% of patients reached NYHA 
      class II at 6 months, p < 0.005; 60% of patients at 12 months, p < 0.005) and 
      6-min walk test distance (from 244.59 ± 119.59 m at baseline to 311.78 ± 129.88 m 
      after 6 months, p < 0.05, and 343.95 ± 146.15 m after 12 months, p < 0.05). 
      CONCLUSION: The V-LAP™ monitoring system proved to be generally safe and provided 
      a good correlation with invasive PCWP. Initial evidence also suggests possible 
      improvement in HF clinical symptoms.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the experiences of patients with type 1 diabetes 
      following transition from a calibration-requiring to a calibration-free sensor 
      and remote monitoring in the context of using automated insulin delivery (AID). 
      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Fifteen participants aged 7-65 years with type 1 
      diabetes participating in a longitudinal study used a Medtronic® advanced hybrid 
      closed loop (AHCL) device with initially calibration-requiring then 
      calibration-free sensors. Qualitative interviews were conducted ≥20 weeks 
      following use of the calibration-requiring and ≥4 weeks after use of the 
      calibration-free sensors/remote monitoring. Thematic analysis was used to 
      identify key themes and subthemes. RESULTS: At baseline, mean diabetes duration 
      was 14.5 years ( ± 10.9), mean Hba1c 54.8 mmol/mol ( ± 10.2) (7.2 ± 0.9%) and 
      Time in range 75.4% ( ± 11.6). Participants reported a progressive improvement in 
      digital and lifestyle integration, and device trust following transition to 
      calibration-free sensors with remote monitoring potential. They also reported a 
      reduced need for capillary glucose, increased device satisfaction and trust, and 
      reduced burden of diabetes care. Negative aspects reported included periodic 
      early sensor loss, and for some, impaired integration with mobile devices. 
      CONCLUSION: Transitioning to calibration-free sensors with remote monitoring 
      while using AHCL was associated with better user experience, including 
      perceptions of improved quality of life and a reduced burden of diabetes care. 
      Appropriate expectation setting, training, and ongoing support allow for the 
      optimal user experience while using AHCL. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Measuring the Usability of eHealth Solutions for Patients With Parkinson Disease: 
      Observational Study.
PG  - e39954
LID - 10.2196/39954 [doi]
LID - e39954
AB  - BACKGROUND: Parkinson disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with a variety 
      of motor and nonmotor symptoms. Many of these symptoms can be monitored by 
      eHealth solutions, including smartphone apps, wearable sensors, and camera 
      systems. The usability of such systems is a key factor in long-term use, but not 
      much is known about the predictors of successful use and preferable methods to 
      assess usability in patients with PD. OBJECTIVE: This study tested methods to 
      assess usability and determined prerequisites for successful use in patients with 
      PD. METHODS: We performed comprehensive usability assessments with 18 patients 
      with PD using a mixed methods usability battery containing the System Usability 
      Scale, a rater-based evaluation of device-specific tasks, and qualitative 
      interviews. Each patient performed the usability battery with 2 of 3 randomly 
      assigned devices: a tablet app, wearable sensors, and a camera system. The 
      usability battery was administered at the beginning and at the end of a 4-day 
      testing period. Between usability batteries, the systems were used by the 
      patients during 3 sessions of motor assessments (wearable sensors and camera 
      system) and at the movement disorder ward (tablet app). RESULTS: In this study, 
      the rater-based evaluation of tasks discriminated the best between the 3 eHealth 
      solutions, whereas subjective modalities such as the System Usability Scale were 
      not able to distinguish between the systems. Successful use was associated with 
      different clinical characteristics for each system: eHealth literacy and 
      cognitive function predicted successful use of the tablet app, and better motor 
      function and lower age correlated with the independent use of the camera system. 
      The successful use of the wearable sensors was independent of clinical 
      characteristics. Unfortunately, patients who were not able to use the devices 
      well provided few improvement suggestions in qualitative interviews. CONCLUSIONS: 
      eHealth solutions should be developed with a specific set of patients in mind and 
      subsequently tested in this cohort. For a complete picture, usability assessments 
      should include a rater-based evaluation of task performance, and there is a need 
      to develop strategies to circumvent the underrepresentation of poorly performing 
      patients in qualitative usability research.

      Status in Palliative Cancer Patients Using Wearables.
PG  - 386-395
LID - 10.1159/000501433 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mobile health is a promising strategy aiming to anticipate and 
      prevent the deterioration of health status in palliative cancer patients. A 
      prerequisite for successful implementation of this technology into clinical 
      routine is a high level of usability and acceptance of devices. OBJECTIVES: We 
      aimed to evaluate feasibility as well as patients' acceptance of remote 
      monitoring using wearables in palliative cancer patients. METHODS: In this 
      prospective single-center observational feasibility study, 30 cancer patients 
      treated with palliative intent in an inpatient setting with an estimated life 
      expectancy of >8 weeks and <12 months were provided with a smartphone including a 
      pre-installed "Activity Monitoring" app and a sensor-equipped bracelet and 
      monitored over a period of 12 weeks starting at discharge from hospital. We 
      report detailed feasibility and usability aspects and comment on patients' 
      acceptance of the wearables. RESULTS: Between February 2017 and May 2018 a total 
      of 30 patients were included in the study. From these, 25 participants (83%) 
      completed the whole study period. On average, the bracelet was worn on 53% and 
      smartphone used on 85% of the study days. The completion rate of daily digital 
      questionnaires for subjective ratings (pain and distress scale) was 73%, and 28 
      patients were able to handle the wearables and to operate the app without major 
      problems. Use of the bracelet was low during the night hours, with a wearing time 
      of 1.7% of all night hours (8 p.m. to 8 a.m.). CONCLUSIONS: Remote monitoring of 
      health care status in palliative cancer patients with a limited life expectancy 
      is feasible and patients are able to handle the smartphone and the 
      sensor-equipped bracelet. Feedback towards use of this monitoring system was 
      mostly positive.

LID - e46866
AB  - BACKGROUND: The recent growth of eHealth is unprecedented, especially after the 
      COVID-19 pandemic. Within eHealth, wearable technology is increasingly being 
      adopted because it can offer the remote monitoring of chronic and acute 
      conditions in daily life environments. Wearable technology may be used to monitor 
      and track key indicators of physical and psychological stress in daily life 
      settings, providing helpful information for clinicians. One of the key challenges 
      is to present extensive wearable data to clinicians in an easily interpretable 
      manner to make informed decisions. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this research was to 
      design a wearable data dashboard, named CarePortal, to present analytic 
      visualizations of wearable data that are meaningful to clinicians. The study was 
      divided into 2 main research objectives: to understand the needs of clinicians 
      regarding wearable data interpretation and visualization and to develop a system 
      architecture for a web application to visualize wearable data and related 
      analytics. METHODS: We used a wearable data set collected from 116 adolescent 
      participants who experienced trauma. For 2 weeks, participants wore a Microsoft 
      Band that logged physiological sensor data such as heart rate (HR). A total of 
      834 days of HR data were collected. To design the CarePortal dashboard, we used a 
      participatory design approach that interacted directly with clinicians 
      (stakeholders) with backgrounds in clinical psychology and neuropsychology. A 
      total of 8 clinicians were recruited from the Rhode Island Hospital and the 
      University of Massachusetts Memorial Health. The study involved 5 stages of 
      participatory workshops and began with an understanding of the needs of 
      clinicians. A User Experience Questionnaire was used at the end of the study to 
      quantitatively evaluate user experience. Physiological metrics such as daily and 
      hourly maximum, minimum, average, and SD of HR and HR variability, along with 
      HR-based activity levels, were identified. This study investigated various data 
      visualization graphing methods for wearable data, including radar charts, stacked 
      bar plots, scatter plots combined with line plots, simple bar plots, and box 
      plots. RESULTS: We created a CarePortal dashboard after understanding the 
      clinicians' needs. Results from our workshops indicate that overall clinicians 
      preferred aggregate information such as daily HR instead of continuous HR and 
      want to see trends in wearable sensor data over a period (eg, days). In the User 
      Experience Questionnaire, a score of 1.4 was received, which indicated that 
      CarePortal was exciting to use (question 5), and a similar score was received, 
      indicating that CarePortal was the leading edge (question 8). On average, 
      clinicians reported that CarePortal was supportive and can be useful in making 
      informed decisions. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that the CarePortal dashboard 
      integrated with wearable sensor data visualization techniques would be an 
      acceptable tool for clinicians to use in the future.

TI  - Post-Operative Remote Monitoring for Same-Day Discharge Elective Orthopedic 
      Surgery: A Pilot Study.
LID - 10.3390/s21175754 [doi]
LID - 5754
AB  - The purposes of this pilot study are to utilize digital remote monitoring to (a) 
      evaluate the usability and satisfaction of a wireless blood pressure (BP) and 
      heart rate (HR) monitor and (b) determine whether these data can enable safe 
      mobilization at home after same-day discharge (SDD) joint replacement. A 
      population of 23 SDD patients undergoing unicompartmental knee arthroplasty 
      (UKA), total knee arthroplasty (TKA), or total hip arthroplasty (THA) were given 
      a cellular BP/HR monitor, with real-time data capture. Patients took three 
      readings after surgery, observing for specific blood pressure decreases, HR 
      increases, or hypotensive symptoms. If any criteria applied, patients followed a 
      hydration protocol and delayed ambulation. Home coaching was also provided to 
      each patient. Patient experience was surveyed, and responses were assessed using 
      descriptive statistics. Of 18 patients discharged (78%), 17 returned surveys, of 
      which 100% reported successful device operation. The mean "ease of use" rating 
      was 8.9/10; satisfaction with home coaching was 9.7/10; and belief that the 
      protocol improved patient safety was 8.4/10. A total of 27.8% (n = 5) had 
      hypotensive readings and appropriately delayed ambulation. Our pilot findings 
      support the feasibility of and confirm the satisfaction with remote monitoring 
      after SDD arthroplasty. All patients with symptoms of hypotension were 
      successfully remotely managed using a standardized hydration protocol prior to 
      safe mobilization.

TI  - Older Adults' and Clinicians' Perspectives on a Smart Health Platform for the 
      Aging Population: Design and Evaluation Study.
PG  - e29623
LID - 10.2196/29623 [doi]
LID - e29623
AB  - BACKGROUND: Over recent years, interest in the development of smart health 
      technologies aimed at supporting independent living for older populations has 
      increased. The integration of innovative technologies, such as the Internet of 
      Things, wearable technologies, artificial intelligence, and ambient-assisted 
      living applications, represents a valuable solution for this scope. Designing 
      such an integrated system requires addressing several aspects (eg, equipment 
      selection, data management, analytics, costs, and users' needs) and involving 
      different areas of expertise (eg, medical science, service design, biomedical and 
      computer engineering). OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is 2-fold; we aimed 
      to design the functionalities of a smart health platform addressing 5 chronic 
      conditions prevalent in the older population (ie, hearing loss, cardiovascular 
      diseases, cognitive impairments, mental health problems, and balance disorders) 
      by considering both older adults' and clinicians' perspectives and to evaluate 
      the identified smart health platform functionalities with a small group of older 
      adults. METHODS: Overall, 24 older adults (aged >65 years) and 118 clinicians 
      were interviewed through focus group activities and web-based questionnaires to 
      elicit the smart health platform requirements. Considering the elicited 
      requirements, the main functionalities of smart health platform were designed. 
      Then, a focus group involving 6 older adults was conducted to evaluate the 
      proposed solution in terms of usefulness, credibility, desirability, and 
      learnability. RESULTS: Eight main functionalities were identified and 
      assessed-cognitive training and hearing training (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; 
      credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 6/6, 100%; learnability: 6/6, 100%), 
      monitoring of physiological parameters (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; credibility: 6/6, 
      100%; desirability: 6/6, 100%; learnability: 5/6, 83%), physical training 
      (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 5/6, 83%; 
      learnability: 2/6, 33%), psychoeducational intervention (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; 
      credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 4/6, 67%; learnability: 2/6, 33%), mood 
      monitoring (usefulness: 4/6, 67%; credibility: 4/6, 67%; desirability: 3/6, 50%; 
      learnability: 5/6, 50%), diet plan (usefulness: 5/6, 83%; credibility: 4/6, 67%; 
      desirability: 1/6, 17%; learnability: 2/6, 33%), and environment monitoring and 
      adjustment (usefulness: 1/6, 17%; credibility: 1/6, 17%; desirability: 0/6, 0%; 
      learnability: 0/6, 0%). Most of them were highly appreciated by older 
      participants, with the only exception being environment monitoring and 
      adjustment. The results showed that the proposed functionalities met the needs 
      and expectations of users (eg, improved self-management of patients' disease and 
      enhanced patient safety). However, some aspects need to be addressed (eg, 
      technical and privacy issues). CONCLUSIONS: The presented smart health platform 
      functionalities seem to be able to meet older adults' needs and desires to 
      enhance their self-awareness and self-management of their medical condition, 
      encourage healthy and independent living, and provide evidence-based support for 
      clinicians' decision-making. Further research with a larger and more 
      heterogeneous pool of stakeholders in terms of demographics and clinical 
      conditions is needed to assess system acceptability and overall user experience 
      in free-living conditions.

TI  - Personalized Analytics and a Wearable Biosensor Platform for Early Detection of 
      COVID-19 Decompensation (DeCODe): Protocol for the Development of the COVID-19 
      Decompensation Index.
PG  - e27271
LID - 10.2196/27271 [doi]
LID - e27271
AB  - BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, novel digital health technologies have 
      the potential to improve our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, improve 
      care delivery, and produce better health outcomes. The National Institutes of 
      Health called on digital health leaders to contribute to a high-quality data 
      repository that will support researchers to make discoveries that are otherwise 
      not possible with small, limited data sets. OBJECTIVE: To this end, we seek to 
      develop a COVID-19 digital biomarker for early detection of physiological 
      exacerbation or decompensation. We propose the development and validation of a 
      COVID-19 decompensation Index (CDI) in a 2-phase study that builds on existing 
      wearable biosensor-derived analytics generated by physIQ's end-to-end cloud 
      platform for continuous physiological monitoring with wearable biosensors. This 
      effort serves to achieve two primary objectives: (1) to collect adequate data to 
      help develop the CDI and (2) to collect rich deidentified clinical data 
      correlating with outcomes and symptoms related to COVID-19 progression. Our 
      secondary objectives include evaluation of the feasibility and usability of 
      pinpointIQ, a digital platform through which data are gathered, analyzed, and 
      displayed. METHODS: This is a prospective, nonrandomized, open-label, 2-phase 
      study. Phase I will involve data collection for the digital data hub of the 
      National Institutes of Health as well as data to support the preliminary 
      development of the CDI. Phase II will involve data collection for the hub and 
      contribute to continued refinement and validation of the CDI. While this study 
      will focus on the development of a CDI, the digital platform will also be 
      evaluated for feasibility and usability while clinicians deliver care to 
      continuously monitored patients enrolled in the study. RESULTS: Our target CDI 
      will be a binary classifier trained to distinguish participants with and those 
      without decompensation. The primary performance metric for CDI will be the area 
      under the receiver operating characteristic curve with a minimum performance 
      criterion of ≥0.75 (α=.05; power [1-β]=0.80). Furthermore, we will determine the 
      sex or gender and race or ethnicity of the participants, which would account for 
      differences in the CDI performance, as well as the lead time-time to predict 
      decompensation-and its relationship with the ultimate disease severity based on 
      the World Health Organization COVID-19 ordinal scale. CONCLUSIONS: Using machine 
      learning techniques on a large data set of patients with COVID-19 could provide 
      valuable insights into the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and a digital biomarker 
      for COVID-19 decompensation. Through this study, we intend to develop a tool that 
      can uniquely reflect physiological data of a diverse population and contribute to 
      high-quality data that will help researchers better understand COVID-19. TRIAL

AB  - Background: The idea of product usability has been discussed in several research 
      areas including product research and development. Usability, in telecare 
      monitoring systems, determines how much the system is effective and efficient for 
      the telecare users. Usability has been considered an important factor in the 
      acceptance of telecare monitoring systems by individuals who encounter challenges 
      in the use of such systems and who possess a limited knowledge of their 
      use.Objectives: The purpose of this study is to explore the relevant usability 
      issues and identify possible solutions to improve the usability of telecare 
      monitoring systems.Method: The study is based on eight research questions and to 
      find the answers to those research questions, a systematic literature is 
      performed.Results: The research findings highlight various usability issues, 
      including the complexity of the interface, difficulty in reading the text, and 
      insufficient provision of instructions. These studies have also suggested 
      solutions to enhance the usability of systems, including development of the 
      technical skills of users, explanations of usability evaluation techniques for 
      telecare monitoring systems, and engaging the appropriate users during the 
      development of telecare monitoring systems.Implications for 
      rehabilitationSuccessful implementation of telecare monitoring systems can 
      increase the chances of acceptance of telecare monitoring systems by the 
      users.Implementing an efficient and effective system will make telecare users 
      more independent at their homes.The development of usable telecare monitoring 
      systems can significantly contribute to a basis for clinical and home-based 
      implementation of the telehealth technology to promote remote monitoring for 
      elderly and people with disabilities.Considering the usability issues and 
      solutions identified in this study, it will go a long way towards aiding 
      subsequent researchers and developers in the implementation of more usable and 
      valid telecare monitoring systems.

TI  - Assessing the Usability of a Novel Wearable Remote Patient Monitoring Device for 
      the Early Detection of In-Hospital Patient Deterioration: Observational Study.
PG  - e36066
LID - 10.2196/36066 [doi]
LID - e36066
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients admitted to general wards are inherently at risk of 
      deterioration. Thus, tools that can provide early detection of deterioration may 
      be lifesaving. Frequent remote patient monitoring (RPM) has the potential to 
      allow such early detection, leading to a timely intervention by health care 
      providers. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the potential of a novel 
      wearable RPM device to provide timely alerts in patients at high risk for 
      deterioration. METHODS: This prospective observational study was conducted in two 
      general wards of a large tertiary medical center. Patients determined to be at 
      high risk to deteriorate upon admission and assigned to a telemetry bed were 
      included. On top of the standard monitoring equipment, a wearable monitor was 
      attached to each patient, and monitoring was conducted in parallel. The data 
      gathered by the wearable monitors were analyzed retrospectively, with the medical 
      staff being blinded to them in real time. Several early warning scores of the 
      risk for deterioration were used, all calculated from frequent data collected by 
      the wearable RPM device: these included (1) the National Early Warning Score 
      (NEWS), (2) Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Neurology, and Other (ABCNO) score, 
      and (3) deterioration criteria defined by the clinical team as a "wish list" 
      score. In all three systems, the risk scores were calculated every 5 minutes 
      using the data frequently collected by the wearable RPM device. Data generated by 
      the early warning scores were compared with those obtained from the clinical 
      records of actual deterioration among these patients. RESULTS: In total, 410 
      patients were recruited and 217 were included in the final analysis. The median 
      age was 71 (IQR 62-78) years and 130 (59.9%) of them were male. Actual clinical 
      deterioration occurred in 24 patients. The NEWS indicated high alert in 16 of 
      these 24 (67%) patients, preceding actual clinical deterioration by 29 hours on 
      average. The ABCNO score indicated high alert in 18 (75%) of these patients, 
      preceding actual clinical deterioration by 38 hours on average. Early warning 
      based on wish list scoring criteria was observed for all 24 patients 40 hours on 
      average before clinical deterioration was detected by the medical staff. 
      Importantly, early warning based on the wish list scoring criteria was also 
      observed among all other patients who did not deteriorate. CONCLUSIONS: Frequent 
      remote patient monitoring has the potential for early detection of a high risk to 
      deteriorate among hospitalized patients, using both grouped signal-based scores 
      and algorithm-based prediction. In this study, we show the ability to formulate 
      scores for early warning by using RPM. Nevertheless, early warning scores 
      compiled on the basis of these data failed to deliver reasonable specificity. 
      Further efforts should be directed at improving the specificity and sensitivity 
      of such tools. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04220359;

TI  - Feasibility and Usability of a Mobile App-Based Interactive Care Plan for 
      Migraine in a Community Neurology Practice: Development and Pilot Implementation 
      Study.
PG  - e48372
LID - 10.2196/48372 [doi]
LID - e48372
AB  - BACKGROUND: Migraine is a common and major cause of disability, poor quality of 
      life, and high health care use. Access to evidence-based migraine care is limited 
      and projected to worsen. Novel mobile health app-based tools may effectively 
      deliver migraine patient education to support self-management, facilitate remote 
      monitoring and treatment, and improve access to care. The risk that such an 
      intervention may increase the care team workload is a potential implementation 
      barrier. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe a novel electronic health 
      record-integrated mobile app-based Migraine Interactive Care Plan (MICP) and 
      evaluate its feasibility, usability, and impact on care teams in a community 
      neurology practice. METHODS: Consecutive enrollees between September 1, 2020, and 
      February 16, 2022, were assessed in a single-arm observational study of 
      usability, defined by 74.3% (127/171) completing ≥1 assigned task. Task response 
      rates, rate and type of care team escalations, and patient-reported outcomes were 
      summarized. Patients were prospectively recruited and randomly assigned to 
      routine care with or without the MICP from September 1, 2020, to September 1, 
      2021. Feasibility was defined by equal to or fewer downstream face-to-face 
      visits, telephone contacts, and electronic messages in the MICP cohort. The 
      Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare continuous variables, and the 
      chi-square test was used for categorical variables for those with at least 3 
      months of follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 171 patients were enrolled, and of 
      these, 127 (74.3%) patients completed ≥1 MICP-assigned task. Mean escalations per 
      patient per month was 0.9 (SD 0.37; range 0-1.7). Patient-confirmed understanding 
      of the educational materials ranged from 26.6% (45/169) to 56.2% (95/169). 
      Initial mean headache days per week was 4.54 (SD 2.06) days and declined to 2.86 
      (SD 1.87) days at week 26. The percentage of patients reporting favorable 
      satisfaction increased from a baseline of 35% (20/57) to 83% (15/18; response 
      rate of 42/136, 30.9% to 28/68, 41%) over the first 6 months. A total of 121 
      patients with MICP were compared with 62 patients in the control group. No 
      differences were observed in the rate of telephone contacts or electronic 
      messages. Fewer face-to-face visits were observed in the MICP cohort (13/121, 
      10.7%) compared with controls (26/62, 42%; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: We describe the 
      successful implementation of an electronic health record-integrated mobile 
      app-based care plan for migraine in a community neurology practice. We observed 
      fewer downstream face-to-face visits without increasing telephone calls, 
      medication refills, or electronic messages. Our findings suggest that the MICP 
      has the potential to improve patient access without increasing care team workload 
      and the need for patient input from diverse populations to improve and sustain 
      patient engagement. Additional studies are needed to assess its impact in primary 
      care.

TI  - Block freeze concentration by centrifugation and vacuum increases the content of 
      lactose-free milk macronutrients.
PG  - 5317-5329
LID - 10.1111/1750-3841.16383 [doi]
AB  - Lactose-free milk is rising in popularity among consumers due to its claim to be 
      a better digestible product compared to regular fluid milk. For that reason, 
      concentrating on this food is a good alternative for increasing its versatility 
      and usability in different dairy industry segments. Block freeze concentration 
      (BFC) is a simple technology used to concentrate liquid foods through ice crystal 
      formation and subsequent removal of water. Thus, this work aimed to test two 
      variants of the BFC technique on lactose-free milk concentration. In the first 
      approach, it was investigated the centrifugation-assisted BFC of skim 
      lactose-free milk by applying a factorial experimental design. Temperature, time, 
      and rotation speed were the factors, and the response variables included the 
      concentrate yield, concentration index, and efficiency of the process. 
      Concentrate yield and concentration index were mainly affected by the 
      centrifugation temperature. On the other hand, individual factors did not have a 
      significant effect on the efficiency, only their interactions. In the case of 
      centrifugation-assisted BFC in a single step, the condition at 40°C, 70 min, and 
      4500 rpm was considered the best, given the highest values of efficiency and 
      concentrate yield (80.87 and 67.02, respectively), and still an excellent value 
      for concentration index (2.05). Conversely, the condition at 30°C, 45 min, and 
      3500 rpm was chosen to integrate a freeze concentration process in two stage. 
      Then, the ice obtained from the first cycle was subjected to the vacuum-assisted 
      BFC, which consisted in the second cycle. The concentrate obtained from the 
      vacuum-assisted BFC presented contents of total solids, carbohydrates, and 
      protein 2.95, 3.00, and 2.91 times more than the initial lactose-free milk, 
      respectively. Therefore, we believe that the concentrates obtained can be used 
      for the development of innovative lactose-free dairy products. PRACTICAL 
      APPLICATION: Using concentration processes in the dairy industry can 
      significantly contribute to enhancing the overall efficiency of milk processing 
      since huge quantities of water from milk can be reduced, increasing the total 
      solids content. In turn, dairy products that provide a high amount of solids 
      (especially protein) are gaining in popularity among consumers, with consequent 
      interest from researchers. In addition, milk concentration shows advantages in 
      terms of processing, packaging, transportation, and handling. Since most changes 
      occur in an aqueous environment, the removal of some parts of water results in 
      the preservation of milk. It is noteworthy that dairy industries are concerned 
      principally with food preservation, green technologies, and the production of 
      high-quality products. Thus, concentration processes could favor the development 
      of milk products rich in proteins to meet certain demands on functional and 
      nutritional properties, for example in beverages and formulated food.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with colorectal cancer who undergo surgery face many 
      postoperative problems. These problems include the risk of relapse, side effects, 
      and long-term complications. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to design and develop a 
      remote monitoring system as a technological solution for the postdischarge care 
      of these patients. METHODS: This research was conducted in 3 main steps: system 
      feature extraction, system design, and evaluation. After feature extraction from 
      a systematic review, the necessary features were defined by 18 clinical experts 
      in Iran. In the next step, the architecture of the system was designed based on 
      the requirements; the software and hardware parts of the system were embedded in 
      the architecture, then the software system components were drawn using the 
      unified modeling language diagrams, and the details of software system 
      implementation were identified. Regarding the hardware design, different 
      accessible hardware modules were evaluated, and suitable ones were selected. 
      Finally, the usability of the system was evaluated by demonstrating it over a 
      Skype virtual meeting session and using Nilsen's usability principles. RESULTS: A 
      total of 21 mandatory features in 5 main categories, including patient 
      information registration, periodic monitoring of health parameters, education, 
      reminders, and assessments, were defined and validated for the system. The 
      software was developed using an ASP.Net core backend, a Microsoft SQL Server 
      database, and an Ionic frontend alongside the Angular framework, to build an 
      Android app. The user roles of the system included 3 roles: physicians, patients, 
      and the system administrator. The hardware was designed to contain an Esp8266 as 
      the Internet of Things module, an MLX90614 infrared temperature sensor, and the 
      Maxim Integrated MAX30101 sensor for sensing the heartbeat. The hardware was 
      designed in the shape of a wristband device using SolidWorks 2020 and printed 
      using a 3D printer. The firmware of the hardware was developed in Arduino with 
      the capability of firmware over the air. In evaluating the software system from 
      the perspective of usability, the system received an average score of 3.8 out of 
      5 from 4 evaluators. CONCLUSIONS: Sensor-based telemonitoring systems for 
      patients with colorectal cancer after surgery are possible solutions that can 
      make the process automatic for patients and caregivers. The apps for remote 
      colorectal patient monitoring could be designed to be useful; however, more 
      research regarding the developed system's implementation in clinic settings and 
      hospitals is required to understand the probable barriers and limitations.

TI  - Postoperative Remote Automated Monitoring and Virtual Hospital-to-Home Care 
      System Following Cardiac and Major Vascular Surgery: User Testing Study.
PG  - e15548
LID - 10.2196/15548 [doi]
LID - e15548
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac and major vascular surgeries are common surgical procedures 
      associated with high rates of postsurgical complications and related hospital 
      readmission. In-hospital remote automated monitoring (RAM) and virtual 
      hospital-to-home patient care systems have major potential to improve patient 
      outcomes following cardiac and major vascular surgery. However, the science of 
      deploying and evaluating these systems is complex and subject to risk of 
      implementation failure. OBJECTIVE: As a precursor to a randomized controlled 
      trial (RCT), this user testing study aimed to examine user performance and 
      acceptance of a RAM and virtual hospital-to-home care intervention, using 
      Philip's Guardian and Electronic Transition to Ambulatory Care (eTrAC) 
      technologies, respectively. METHODS: Nurses and patients participated in systems 
      training and individual case-based user testing at two participating sites in 
      Canada and the United Kingdom. Participants were video recorded and asked to 
      think aloud while completing required user tasks and while being rated on user 
      performance. Feedback was also solicited about the user experience, including 
      user satisfaction and acceptance, through use of the Net Promoter Scale (NPS) 
      survey and debrief interviews. RESULTS: A total of 37 participants (26 nurses and 
      11 patients) completed user testing. The majority of nurse and patient 
      participants were able to complete most required tasks independently, 
      demonstrating comprehension and retention of required Guardian and eTrAC system 
      workflows. Tasks which required additional prompting by the facilitator, for 
      some, were related to the use of system features that enable continuous 
      transmission of patient vital signs (eg, pairing wireless sensors to the patient) 
      and assigning remote patient monitoring protocols. NPS scores by user group 
      (nurses using Guardian: mean 8.8, SD 0.89; nurses using eTrAC: mean 7.7, SD 1.4; 
      patients using eTrAC: mean 9.2, SD 0.75), overall NPS scores, and participant 
      debrief interviews indicated nurse and patient satisfaction and acceptance of the 
      Guardian and eTrAC systems. Both user groups stressed the need for additional 
      opportunities to practice in order to become comfortable and proficient in the 
      use of these systems. CONCLUSIONS: User testing indicated a high degree of user 
      acceptance of Philips' Guardian and eTrAC systems among nurses and patients. Key 
      insights were provided that informed refinement of clinical workflow training and 
      systems implementation. These results were used to optimize workflows before the 
      launch of an international RCT of in-hospital RAM and virtual hospital-to-home 
      care for patients undergoing cardiac and major vascular surgery.

TI  - Understanding Barriers to the Collection of Mobile and Wearable Device Data to 
      Monitor Health and Cognition in Older Adults: A Scoping Review.
PG  - 186-195
AB  - Advances in technology have made continuous/remote monitoring of digital health 
      data possible, which can enable the early detection and treatment of age-related 
      cognitive and health declines. Using Arksey and O'Malley's methodology, this 
      scoping review evaluated potential barriers to the collection of mobile and 
      wearable device data to monitor health and cognitive status in older adults with 
      and without mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Selected articles were US based and 
      focused on experienced or perceived barriers to the collection of mobile and 
      wearable device data by adults 55 years of age or older. Fourteen articles met 
      the study's inclusion criteria. Identified themes included barriers related to 
      usability, users' prior experiences with health technologies, first and second 
      level digital divide, aesthetics, comfort, adherence, and attitudinal barriers. 
      Addressing these barriers will be crucial for effective digital data-collection 
      among older adults to achieve goals of improving quality of life and reducing 
      care costs.

TI  - Testing the Feasibility of Sensor-Based Home Health Monitoring (TEC4Home) to 
      Support the Convalescence of Patients With Heart Failure: Pre-Post Study.
PG  - e24509
LID - 10.2196/24509 [doi]
LID - e24509
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with heart failure (HF) can be affected by disabling 
      symptoms and low quality of life. Furthermore, they may frequently need to visit 
      the emergency department or be hospitalized due to their condition deteriorating. 
      Home telemonitoring can play a role in tracking symptoms, reducing hospital 
      visits, and improving quality of life. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to conduct a 
      feasibility study of a home health monitoring (HHM) solution for patients with HF 
      in British Columbia, Canada, to prepare for conducting a randomized controlled 
      trial. METHODS: Patients with HF were recruited from 3 urban hospitals and 
      provided with HHM technology for 60 days of monitoring postdischarge. 
      Participants were asked to monitor their weight, blood pressure, and heart rate 
      and to answer symptomology questions via Bluetooth sensors and a tablet computer 
      each day. A monitoring nurse received this data and monitored the patient's 
      condition. In our evaluation, the primary outcome was the combination of 
      unscheduled emergency department revisits of discharged participants or death 
      within 90 days. Secondary outcomes included 90-day hospital readmissions, patient 
      quality of life (as measured by Veterans Rand 12-Item Health Survey and Kansas 
      City Cardiomyopathy Scale), self-efficacy (as measured by European Heart Failure 
      Self-Care Behaviour Scale 9), end-user experience, and health system 
      cost-effectiveness including cost reduction and hospital bed capacity. In this 
      feasibility study, we also tested the recruitment strategy, clinical protocols, 
      evaluation framework, and data collection methods. RESULTS: Seventy participants 
      were enrolled into this trial. Participant engagement to monitoring was measured 
      at 94% (N=70; ie, data submitted 56/60 days on average). Our evaluation framework 
      allowed us to collect sound data, which also showed encouraging trends: a 79% 
      reduction of emergency department revisits post monitoring, an 87% reduction in 
      hospital readmissions, and a 60% reduction in the median hospital length of stay 
      (n=36). Cost of hospitalization for participants decreased by 71%, and emergency 
      department visit costs decreased by 58% (n=30). Overall health system costs for 
      our participants showed a 56% reduction post monitoring (n=30). HF-specific 
      quality of life (Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Scale) scores showed a significant 
      increase of 101% (n=35) post monitoring (P<.001). General quality of life 
      (Veterans Rand 12-Item Health Survey) improved by 19% (n=35) on the mental 
      component score (P<.001) and 19% (n=35) on the physical component score (P=.02). 
      Self-efficacy improved by 6% (n=35). Interviews with participants revealed that 
      they were satisfied overall with the monitoring program and its usability, and 
      participants reported being more engaged, educated, and involved in their 
      self-management. CONCLUSIONS: Results from this small-sample feasibility study 
      suggested that our HHM intervention can be beneficial in supporting patients post 
      discharge. Additionally, key insights from the trial allowed us to refine our 
      methods and procedures, such as shifting our recruitment methods to in-patient 
      wards and increasing our scope of data collection. Although these findings are 
      promising, a more rigorous trial design is required to test the true efficacy of 
      the intervention. The results from this feasibility trial will inform our next 
      step as we proceed with a randomized controlled trial across British Columbia.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Digital devices have demonstrated benefits to patients with chronic 
      and neurodegenerative diseases. But when patients use medical devices in their 
      homes, the technologies have to fit into their lives. We investigated the 
      technology acceptance of seven digital devices for home use. METHODS: We 
      conducted 60 semi-structured interviews with participants of a larger device 
      study on their views on the acceptability of seven devices. Transcriptions were 
      analysed using qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Based on the unified theory 
      of acceptance and use of technology, we evaluated effort, facilitating 
      conditions, performance expectancy and social influence of each device.In the 
      effort category, five themes emerged: (a) the hassle to use the device; (b) its 
      usability; (c) comfort; (d) disturbance to daily life; and (e) problems during 
      usage. Facilitating conditions consisted of five themes: (a) expectations 
      regarding a device; (b) quality of the instructions; (c) insecurities with usage; 
      (d) possibilities of optimization; and (e) possibilities to use the device 
      longer. Regarding performance expectancy, we identified three themes: (a) 
      insecurities with the performance of a device; (b) feedback; and (c) motivation 
      for using a device. In the social influence category, three themes emerged: (a) 
      reactions of peers; (b) concerns with the visibility of a device; and (c) 
      concerns regarding data privacy. CONCLUSIONS: We identify key factors that 
      determine the acceptability of medical devices for home use from the 
      participants' perspective. These include low effort of use, minor disruptions to 
      their daily lives and good support from the study team.

TI  - Participant Experiences of a COVID-19 Virtual Clinical Study Using the Current 
      Health Remote Monitoring Platform: Case Study and Qualitative Analysis.
PG  - e37567

AB  - BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals with a positive viral test 
      were enrolled in a study, within 48 hours, to remotely monitor their vital signs 
      to characterize disease progression and recovery. A virtual trial design was 
      adopted to reduce risks to participants and the research community in a study 
      titled Risk Stratification and Early Alerting Regarding COVID-19 Hospitalization 
      (RiskSEARCH). The Food and Drug Administration-cleared Current Health platform 
      with a wearable device is a continuous remote patient monitoring technology that 
      supports hospital-at-home care and is used as a data collection tool. Enrolled 
      participants wore the Current Health wearable device continuously for up to 30 
      days and took a daily symptom survey via a tablet that was provided. A 
      qualitative substudy was conducted in parallel to better understand virtual trial 
      implementation, including barriers and facilitators for participants. OBJECTIVE: 
      This study aimed to understand the barriers and facilitators of the user 
      experience of interacting with a virtual care platform and research team, while 
      participating in a fully virtual study using qualitative and quantitative data. 
      METHODS: Semistructured interviews were conducted to understand participants' 
      experience of participating in a virtual study during a global pandemic. The 
      schedule included their experience of enrollment and their interactions with 
      equipment and study staff. A total of 3 RiskSEARCH participants were interviewed 
      over telephone, and transcriptions were inductively coded and analyzed using 
      thematic analysis. Themes were mapped onto the Theoretical Domains Framework 
      (TDF) to identify and describe the factors that influenced study adherence. 
      Quantitative metrics, including adherence to wearable and scheduled tasks 
      collected as part of the RiskSEARCH main study, were paired with the interviews 
      to present an overall picture of participation. RESULTS: All participants 
      exceeded our definition of a fully adherent participant and reported that 
      participation was feasible and had a low burden. The symptoms progressively 
      resolved during the trial. Inductive thematic analysis identified 13 main themes 
      from the interview data, which were deductively mapped onto 11 of the 14 TDF 
      domains, highlighting barriers and facilitators for each. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Participants in the RiskSEARCH substudy showed high levels of adherence and 
      engagement throughout participation. Although participants experienced some 
      challenges in setting up and maintaining the Current Health kit (eg, charging 
      devices), they reported feeling that the requirements of participation were both 
      reasonable and realistic. We demonstrated that the TDF can be used for inductive 
      thematic analysis. We anticipate expanding this work in future virtual studies 
      and trials to identify barriers and enabling factors for implementation.

TI  - Active surveillance of chemotherapy-related symptom burden in ambulatory cancer 
      patients via the implementation of electronic patient-reported outcomes and 
      sensor-enabled vital signs capture: protocol for a decentralised feasibility 
      pilot study.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Remote patient monitoring (RPM) has emerged as a potential avenue 
      for optimising the management of symptoms in patients undergoing chemotherapy. 
      However, RPM is a complex, multilevel intervention with technology, workflow, 
      contextual and patient experience components. The purpose of this pilot study is 
      to determine the feasibility of RPM protocol implementation with respect to 
      decentralised recruitment, patient retention, adherence to reporting 
      recommendations, RPM platform usability and patient experience in ambulatory 
      cancer patients at high risk for chemotherapy-related symptoms. METHODS AND 
      ANALYSIS: This protocol describes a single-arm decentralised feasibility pilot 
      study of technology-enhanced outpatient symptom management system in patients 
      with gastrointestinal and thoracic cancer receiving chemotherapy and cancer care 
      at a single site (MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston Texas). An anticipated total 
      of 25 patients will be recruited prior to the initiation of chemotherapy and 
      provided with a set of validated questionnaires at enrollment and after our 
      1-month feasibility pilot trial period. Our intervention entails the 
      self-reporting of symptoms and vital signs via a HIPAA-compliant, secure tablet 
      interface that also enables (1) the provision of self-care materials to patients, 
      (2) generation of threshold alerts to a dedicated call-centre and (3) 
      videoconferencing. Vital sign information (heart rate, blood pressure, pulse, 
      oxygen saturation, weight and temperature) will be captured via Bluetooth-enabled 
      biometric monitoring devices which are integrated with the tablet interface. 
      Protocolised triage and management of symptoms will occur in response to the 
      alerts. Feasibility and acceptability metrics will characterise our recruitment 
      process, protocol adherence, patient retention and usability of the RPM platform. 
      We will also document the perceived effectiveness of our intervention by 
      patients. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has been granted approval by the 
      institutional review board of MD Anderson Cancer Center. We anticipate 
      dissemination of our pilot and subsequent effectiveness trial results via 
      presentations at national conferences and peer-reviewed publications in the 
      relevant medical journals. Our results will also be made available to cancer 
      survivors, their caregivers and hospital administration. TRIAL REGISTRATION

TI  - Feasibility of a Mobile-Based System for Unsupervised Monitoring in Parkinson's 
      Disease.
LID - 10.3390/s21154972 [doi]
LID - 4972
AB  - Mobile health (mHealth) has emerged as a potential solution to providing valuable 
      ecological information about the severity and burden of Parkinson's disease (PD) 
      symptoms in real-life conditions. Objective: The objective of our study was to 
      explore the feasibility and usability of an mHealth system for continuous and 
      objective real-life measures of patients' health and functional mobility, in 
      unsupervised settings. Methods: Patients with a clinical diagnosis of PD, who 
      were able to walk unassisted, and had an Android smartphone were included. 
      Patients were asked to answer a daily survey, to perform three weekly active 
      tests, and to perform a monthly in-person clinical assessment. Feasibility and 
      usability were explored as primary and secondary outcomes. An exploratory 
      analysis was performed to investigate the correlation between data from the 
      mKinetikos app and clinical assessments. Results: Seventeen participants (85%) 
      completed the study. Sixteen participants (94.1%) showed a medium-to-high level 
      of compliance with the mKinetikos system. A 6-point drop in the total score of 
      the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire was observed. Conclusions: Our 
      results support the feasibility of the mKinetikos system for continuous and 
      objective real-life measures of a patient's health and functional mobility. The 
      observed correlations of mKinetikos metrics with clinical data seem to suggest 
      that this mHealth solution is a promising tool to support clinical decisions.

TI  - Multimodal Remote Home Monitoring of Lung Transplant Recipients during COVID-19 
      Vaccinations: Usability Pilot Study of the COVIDA Desk Incorporating Wearable 
      Devices.
LID - 10.3390/medicina59030617 [doi]
LID - 617
AB  - Background and Objectives: Remote patient monitoring (RPM) of vital signs and 
      symptoms for lung transplant recipients (LTRs) has become increasingly relevant 
      in many situations. Nevertheless, RPM research integrating multisensory home 
      monitoring in LTRs is scarce. We developed a novel multisensory home monitoring 
      device and tested it in the context of COVID-19 vaccinations. We hypothesize that 
      multisensory RPM and smartphone-based questionnaire feedback on signs and 
      symptoms will be well accepted among LTRs. To assess the usability and 
      acceptability of a remote monitoring system consisting of wearable devices, 
      including home spirometry and a smartphone-based questionnaire application for 
      symptom and vital sign monitoring using wearable devices, during the first and 
      second SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Materials and Methods: Observational usability 
      pilot study for six weeks of home monitoring with the COVIDA Desk for LTRs. 
      During the first week after the vaccination, intensive monitoring was performed 
      by recording data on physical activity, spirometry, temperature, pulse oximetry 
      and self-reported symptoms, signs and additional measurements. During the 
      subsequent days, the number of monitoring assessments was reduced. LTRs reported 
      on their perceptions of the usability of the monitoring device through a 
      purpose-designed questionnaire. Results: Ten LTRs planning to receive the first 
      COVID-19 vaccinations were recruited. For the intensive monitoring study phase, 
      LTRs recorded symptoms, signs and additional measurements. The most frequent 
      adverse events reported were local pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance and headache. 
      The duration of these symptoms was 5-8 days post-vaccination. Adherence to the 
      main monitoring devices was high. LTRs rated usability as high. The majority were 
      willing to continue monitoring. Conclusions: The COVIDA Desk showed favorable 
      technical performance and was well accepted by the LTRs during the vaccination 
      phase of the pandemic. The feasibility of the RPM system deployment was proven by 
      the rapid recruitment uptake, technical performance (i.e., low number of errors), 
      favorable user experience questionnaires and detailed individual user feedback.

TI  - Feasibility of a Waistband-Type Wireless Wearable Electrocardiogram Monitoring 
      System Based on a Textile Electrode: Development and Usability Study.
PG  - e26469
LID - 10.2196/26469 [doi]
LID - e26469
AB  - BACKGROUND: Electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring in daily life is essential for 
      effective management of cardiovascular disease, a leading cause of death. 
      Wearable ECG measurement systems in the form of clothing have been proposed to 
      replace Holter monitors used for clinical ECG monitoring; however, they have 
      limitations in daily use because they compress the upper body and, in doing so, 
      cause discomfort during wear. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to develop 
      a wireless wearable ECG monitoring system that includes a textile ECG electrode 
      that can be applied to the lining of pants and can be used in the same way that 
      existing lower clothing is worn, without compression to the upper body. METHODS: 
      A textile electrode with stretchable characteristics was fabricated by knitting a 
      conductive yarn together with polyester-polyurethane fiber, which was then coated 
      with silver compound; an ECG electrode was developed by placing it on an elastic 
      band in a modified limb lead configuration. In addition, a system with 
      analog-to-digital conversion, wireless communication, and a smartphone app was 
      developed, allowing users to be able to check and store their own ECGs in real 
      time. A signal processing algorithm was also developed to remove noise from the 
      obtained signal and to calculate the heart rate. To evaluate the ECG and heart 
      rate measurement performance of the developed module, a comparative evaluation 
      with a commercial device was performed. ECGs were measured for 5 minutes each in 
      standing, sitting, and lying positions; the mean absolute percentage errors of 
      heart rates measured with both systems were then compared. RESULTS: The system 
      was developed in the form of a belt buckle with a size of 53 × 45 × 12 mm (width 
      × height × depth) and a weight of 23 g. In a qualitative evaluation, it was 
      confirmed that the P-QRS-T waveform was clearly observed in ECGs obtained with 
      the wearable system. From the results of the heart rate estimation, the developed 
      system could track changes in heart rate as calculated by a commercial ECG 
      measuring device; in addition, the mean absolute percentage errors of heart rates 
      were 1.80%, 2.84%, and 2.48% in the standing, sitting, and lying positions, 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The developed system was able to effectively measure 
      ECG and calculate heart rate simply through being worn as existing clothing 
      without upper body pressure. It is anticipated that general usability can be 
      secured through further evaluation under more diverse conditions.

TI  - Satisfaction and Usability of an Information and Communications Technology-Based 
      System by Clinically Healthy Patients With COVID-19 and Medical Professionals: 
      Cross-sectional Survey and Focus Group Interview Study.
PG  - e26227
LID - 10.2196/26227 [doi]
LID - e26227
AB  - BACKGROUND: Digital health care is an important strategy in the war against 
      COVID-19. South Korea introduced living and treatment support centers (LTSCs) to 
      control regional outbreaks and care for patients with asymptomatic or mild 
      COVID-19. Seoul National University Hospital (SNUH) introduced information and 
      communications technology (ICT)-based solutions to manage clinically healthy 
      patients with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate satisfaction 
      and usability by patients and health professionals in the optimal use of a mobile 
      app and wearable device that SNUH introduced to the LTSC for clinically healthy 
      patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Online surveys and focus group interviews were 
      conducted to collect quantitative and qualitative data. RESULTS: Regarding 
      usability testing of the wearable device, perceived usefulness had the highest 
      mean score of 4.45 (SD 0.57) points out of 5. Regarding usability of the mobile 
      app, perceived usefulness had the highest mean score of 4.62 (SD 0.48) points out 
      of 5. Regarding satisfaction items for the mobile app among medical 
      professionals, the "self-reporting" item had the highest mean score of 4.42 (SD 
      0.58) points out of 5. In focus group interviews of health care professionals, 
      hospital information system interfacing was the most important functional 
      requirement for ICT-based COVID-19 telemedicine. CONCLUSIONS: Improvement of 
      patient safety and reduction of the burden on medical staff were the expected 
      positive outcomes. Stability and reliability of the device, patient education, 
      accountability, and reimbursement issues should be considered as part of the 
      development of remote patient monitoring. In responding to a novel contagious 
      disease, telemedicine and a wearable device were shown to be useful during a 
      global crisis.

TI  - Re-imagining the future state of the ventricular assist device controller 
      interface through human-centered design.
LID - 10.1111/aor.14817 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ventricular assist devices (VADs) are effective therapy for patients 
      with end-stage heart failure. Current VAD controllers offer improved 
      interactivity, yet limitations of the visual, tactile, and auditory interface 
      persist that impact patient experience and quality of life (QoL). This study 
      explores how VAD controllers can be redesigned using a human-centered design 
      approach to enhance the emotional and functional experience of the device for 
      patients. METHODS: VAD patients (n = 21), caregivers (n = 4) and healthcare 
      practitioners (n = 24) were interviewed to uncover design opportunities. From 
      this, a series of realistic scenarios to design for emerged. A "design by 
      analogy" method took inspiration from existing consumer products to ideate new 
      functionality for the VAD wearable system, creating concepts for a controller 
      interface and paired wearable device. An additional 15 patients and 2 caregivers 
      were engaged to explore current VAD controller experiences and evaluate the 
      future-state concepts. RESULTS: This research validated the need for increased 
      automation and emergency functionality in VAD controllers, including remote 
      monitoring of data, accurate communication of battery status, and automated 
      medical alerts for critical device alarms. "Manage my health," "Feeling normal," 
      "Social belonging," "Feeling safe," and "Sense of control" emerged as key patient 
      concerns to be met by future VAD controller designs. CONCLUSIONS: The study 
      demonstrated an innovative and relevant approach to improve usability of future 
      VAD peripherals. By considering both emotional and functional perspectives in the 
      design of lifesaving medical devices such as VADs, device manufacturers can 
      uncover new opportunities to improve patient QoL through improved user 
      experiences.

TI  - Usability Evaluation of a Noninvasive Neutropenia Screening Device (PointCheck) 
      for Patients Undergoing Cancer Chemotherapy: Mixed Methods Observational Study.
PG  - e37368
LID - 10.2196/37368 [doi]
LID - e37368
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with cancer undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy face an 
      elevated risk of developing serious infection as a consequence of their 
      treatment, which lowers their white blood cell count and, more specifically, 
      their absolute neutrophil count. This condition is known as neutropenia. 
      Neutropenia accompanied by a fever is referred to as febrile neutropenia, a 
      common side effect of chemotherapy with a high mortality rate. The timely 
      detection of severe neutropenia (<500 absolute neutrophil count/μL) is critical 
      in detecting and managing febrile neutropenia. Current methods rely on blood 
      draws, which limit them to clinical settings and do not allow frequent or 
      portable monitoring. In this study, we demonstrated the usability of PointCheck, 
      a noninvasive device for neutropenia screening, in a simulated home environment 
      without clinical supervision. PointCheck automatically performs microscopy 
      through the skin of the finger to image the blood flowing through superficial 
      microcapillaries and enables the remote monitoring of neutropenia status, without 
      requiring venipuncture. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the usability of 
      PointCheck, a noninvasive optical technology for screening severe neutropenia, 
      with the goal of identifying potential user interface, functionality, and design 
      issues from the perspective of untrained users. METHODS: We conducted a 
      multicenter study using quantitative and qualitative approaches to evaluate the 
      usability of PointCheck across 154 untrained participants. We used a mixed method 
      approach to gather usability data through user testing observations, a 
      short-answer qualitative questionnaire, and a standardized quantitative System 
      Usability Scale (SUS) survey to assess perceived usability and satisfaction. 
      RESULTS: Of the 154 participants, we found that 108 (70.1%) scored above 80.8 on 
      the SUS across all sites, with a mean SUS score of 86.1 across all sites. 
      Furthermore, the SUS results indicated that, out of the 151 users who completed 
      the SUS survey, 145 (96%) found that they learned how to use PointCheck very 
      quickly, and 141 (93.4%) felt very confident when using the device. CONCLUSIONS: 
      We have shown that PointCheck, a novel technology for noninvasive, home-based 
      neutropenia detection, can be safely and effectively operated by first-time 
      users. In a simulated home environment, these users found it easy to use, with a 
      mean SUS score of 86.1, indicating an excellent perception of usability and 
      placing this device within the top tenth percentile of systems evaluated for 
      usability by the SUS. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04448314;

TI  - Perspectives on the Gamification of an Interactive Health Technology for 
      Postoperative Rehabilitation of Pediatric Anterior Cruciate Ligament 
      Reconstruction: User-Centered Design Approach.
PG  - e27195
LID - 10.2196/27195 [doi]
LID - e27195
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pediatric and adolescent athletes are a large demographic undergoing 
      anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACL-R). Postoperative rehabilitation 
      is critical, requiring patients to complete home exercise programs (HEPs). To 
      address obstacles to HEP adherence, we developed an interactive health 
      technology, interACTION (iA), to monitor knee-specific rehabilitation. iA is a 
      web-based platform that incorporates wearable motion sensors and a mobile app 
      that provides feedback and allows remote monitoring. The Wheel of Sukr is a 
      gamification mechanism that includes numerous behavioral elements. OBJECTIVE: 
      This study aims to use a user-centered design process to incorporate behavioral 
      change strategies derived from self-management theory into iA using the Wheel of 
      Sukr, with the aim of influencing patient behavior. METHODS: In total, 10 
      athletes aged 10-18 years with a history of ACL-R were included in this study. 
      Patients were between 4 weeks and 1 year post-ACL-R. Participants underwent a 
      60-minute triphasic interview. Phase 1 focused on elements of gaming that led to 
      high participation and information regarding surgery and recovery. In phase 2, 
      participants were asked to think aloud and rank cards representing the components 
      of the Wheel of Sukr in order of interest. In phase 3, the patients reviewed the 
      current version of iA. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and checked for 
      accuracy. Qualitative content analysis segmented the data and tagged meaningful 
      codes until descriptive redundancy was achieved; next, 2 coders independently 
      coded the data set. These elements were categorized according to the Wheel of 
      Sukr framework. The mean age of participants was 12.8 (SD 1.32) years, and 70% 
      (7/10) were female. Most participants (7/10, 70%) reported attending sessions 
      twice weekly. All patients were prescribed home exercises. Self-reported HEP 
      compliance was 75%-100% in 40% (4/10), 50%-75% in 40% (4/10), and 25%-50% of 
      prescribed exercises in 20% (2/10) of the participants. RESULTS: The participants 
      responded positively to an app that could track home exercises. Desirable 
      features included exercise demonstrations, motivational components, and 
      convenience. The participants listed sports specificity, competition, 
      notifications, reminders, rewards, and social aspects of gameplay as features to 
      incorporate. In the Wheel of Sukr card sort exercise, motivation was ranked 
      first; self-management, second; and growth, esteem, and fun tied for the third 
      position. The recommended gameplay components closely followed the themes from 
      the Wheel of Sukr card sort activity. CONCLUSIONS: The participants believe iA is 
      a helpful addition to recovery and want the app to include exercise movement 
      tracking and encouragement. Despite the small number of participants, thematic 
      saturation was reached, suggesting the sample was sufficient to obtain a 
      representative range of perspectives. Future work will implement motivation; 
      self-management; and growth, confidence, and fun in the iA user experience. Young 
      athlete ACL-R patients will complete typical clinical scenarios using 
      increasingly developed prototypes of the gamified iA in a controlled setting.

TI  - The Utility of a Novel Electrocardiogram Patch Using Dry Electrodes Technology 
      for Arrhythmia Detection During Exercise and Prolonged Monitoring: 
      Proof-of-Concept Study.
PG  - e49346
LID - 10.2196/49346 [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate detection of myocardial ischemia and arrhythmias during 
      free-living exercise could play a pivotal role in screening and monitoring for 
      the prevention of exercise-related cardiovascular events in high-risk 
      populations. Although remote electrocardiogram (ECG) solutions are emerging 
      rapidly, existing technology is neither designed nor validated for continuous use 
      during vigorous exercise. OBJECTIVE: In this proof-of-concept study, we evaluated 
      the usability, signal quality, and accuracy for arrhythmia detection of a 
      single-lead ECG patch platform featuring self-adhesive dry electrode technology 
      in individuals with chronic coronary syndrome. This sensor was evaluated during 
      exercise and for prolonged, continuous monitoring. METHODS: We recruited a total 
      of 6 consecutive patients with chronic coronary syndrome scheduled for an 
      exercise stress test (EST) as part of routine cardiac follow-up. Traditional 
      12-lead ECG recording was combined with monitoring with the ECG patch. Following 
      the EST, the participants continuously wore the sensor for 5 days. Intraclass 
      correlation coefficients (ICC) and Wilcoxon signed rank tests were used to assess 
      the utility of detecting arrhythmias with the patch by comparing the evaluations 
      of 2 blinded assessors. Signal quality during EST and prolonged monitoring was 
      evaluated by using a signal quality indicator. Additionally, connection time was 
      calculated for prolonged ECG monitoring. The comfort and usability of the patch 
      were evaluated by a web-based self-assessment questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 
      6 male patients with chronic coronary syndrome (mean age 69.8, SD 6.2 years) 
      completed the study protocol. The patch was worn for a mean of 118.3 (SD 5.6) 
      hours. The level of agreement between the patch and 12-lead ECG was excellent for 
      the detection of premature atrial contractions and premature ventricular 
      contractions during the whole test (ICC=0.998, ICC=1.000). No significant 
      differences in the total number of premature atrial contractions and premature 
      ventricular contractions were detected neither during the entire exercise test 
      (P=.79 and P=.18, respectively) nor during the exercise and recovery stages 
      separately (P=.41, P=.66, P=.18, and P=.66). A total of 1 episode of atrial 
      fibrillation was detected by both methods. Total connection time during recording 
      was between 88% and 100% for all participants. There were no reports of skin 
      irritation, erythema, or pain while wearing the patch. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      proof-of-concept study showed that this innovative ECG patch based on 
      self-adhesive dry electrode technology can potentially be used for arrhythmia 
      detection during vigorous exercise. The results suggest that the wearable patch 
      is also usable for prolonged continuous ECG monitoring in free-living conditions 
      and can therefore be of potential use in cardiac rehabilitation and 
      tele-monitoring for the prevention of exercise-related cardiovascular events. 
      Future efforts will focus on optimizing signal quality over time and conducting a 
      larger-scale validation study focusing on both arrhythmia and ischemia detection.

TI  - Day and night comfort and stability on the body of four wearable devices for 
      seizure detection: A direct user-experience.

AB  - PURPOSE: Wearable devices are progressively becoming an available tool for 
      continuous seizure detection. Motivation to use wearables is not only driven by 
      the accuracy and reliability of the performance but also by the form factor, 
      comfort, and stability on the body. We collected direct feedback and device 
      placement-related issues experienced by a cohort of people with epilepsy (PWE) to 
      investigate to what extent available devices are nonintrusive, comfortable, and 
      stable on the body. METHODS: Four models of wearable devices (E4 wrist band, 
      Everion upper arm band, IMEC upper arm band, and Epilog scalp patch electrodes) 
      were worn by PWE who were admitted to two epilepsy monitoring units (EMUs) in 
      London and Freiburg. Participants were periodically reviewed, and accidental 
      displacements of the devices were annotated. Participants' experience was 
      assessed using the Technology Acceptance Model Fast Form (TAM-FF) plus two 
      additional questions on comfort. A thematic analysis was also performed on the 
      free text of the questionnaire. RESULTS: One hundred and fifteen participants 
      were enrolled. The devices had a good stability on the body including during 
      seizures. Overall, all the devices were considered comfortable to be worn, 
      including during sleep. However, devices containing wires and patches 
      demonstrated a lesser degree of stability on the body and were judged less 
      positively. Participants age was correlated with TAM-FF mean scores, and older 
      participants judged the devices less favorably compared with younger 
      participants. DISCUSSION: Removable but securely fitted, wireless, and 
      comfortable designs were considered more appropriate for a continuous monitoring 
      aimed at seizure detection. Some caution may be required when patch electrodes 
      and electrodes glued to the skin or to the scalp are used, as those evaluated in 
      the present study demonstrated a lower level of acceptability and a lower degree 
      of stability to the body, especially at night. These factors could limit a 
      continuous monitoring decreasing the device performance for nocturnal, 
      unsupervised seizures which are at higher risk of lethality.

AB  - BACKGROUND: More responsive, reliable, and clinically valid endpoints of 
      disability are essential to reduce size, duration, and burden of clinical trials 
      in adult persons with spinal muscular atrophy (aPwSMA). OBJECTIVE: The aim is to 
      investigate the feasibility of smartphone-based assessments in aPwSMA and provide 
      evidence on the reliability and construct validity of sensor-derived measures 
      (SDMs) of mobility and manual dexterity collected remotely in aPwSMA. METHODS: 
      Data were collected from 59 aPwSMA (23 walkers, 20 sitters and 16 non-sitters) 
      and 30 age-matched healthy controls (HC). SDMs were extracted from five 
      smartphone-based tests capturing mobility and manual dexterity, which were 
      administered in-clinic and remotely in daily life for four weeks. Reliability 
      (Intraclass Correlation Coefficients, ICC) and construct validity (ability to 
      discriminate between HC and aPwSMA and correlations with Revised Upper Limb 
      Module, RULM and Hammersmith Functional Scale - Expanded HFMSE) were quantified 
      for all SDMs. RESULTS: The smartphone-based assessments proved feasible, with 
      92.1% average adherence in aPwSMA. The SDMs allowed to reliably assess both 
      mobility and dexterity (ICC > 0.75 for 14/22 SDMs). Twenty-one out of 22 SDMs 
      significantly discriminated between HC and aPwSMA. The highest correlations with 
      the RULM were observed for SDMs from the manual dexterity tests in both 
      non-sitters (Typing, ρ= 0.78) and sitters (Pinching, ρ= 0.75). In walkers, the 
      highest correlation was between mobility tests and HFMSE (5 U-Turns, ρ= 0.79). 
      CONCLUSIONS: This exploratory study provides preliminary evidence for the 
      usability of smartphone-based assessments of mobility and manual dexterity in 
      aPwSMA when deployed remotely in participants' daily life. Reliability and 
      construct validity of SDMs remotely collected in real-life was demonstrated, 
      which is a pre-requisite for their use in longitudinal trials. Additionally, 
      three novel smartphone-based performance outcome assessments were successfully 
      established for aPwSMA. Upon further validation of responsiveness to 
      interventions, this technology holds potential to increase the efficiency of 
      clinical trials in aPwSMA.

TI  - Experiences With Developing and Using Vital Sign Telemonitoring to Support Mobile 
      Nursing in Rural Regions: Feasibility and Usability Study.
PG  - e17113
LID - 10.2196/17113 [doi]
LID - e17113
AB  - BACKGROUND: Modern information and communication technology has the potential to 
      support mobile care in rural regions such as the Alpine region, which is 
      characterized by long distances or even physically unreachable areas. OBJECTIVE: 
      This study investigated the potential of supporting mobile nursing organizations 
      in rural regions with the use of mobile telemonitoring systems in a case study 
      setting. METHODS: As a subproject of the European Union-funded project INTESI, 
      the VITAl parameter MOnitoring (VITAMO) project gathered stakeholders' 
      requirements for telemonitoring support of mobile care in rural regions and then 
      developed and implemented a prototype system that was used for a 3-month test 
      period with a local nursing organization in Austria. Log analysis, surveys, and 
      interviews were used to evaluate the system according to the Technology 
      Acceptance Model. The focus was technology assessment and user satisfaction of 
      both patients and nurses. RESULTS: Participants were provided Bluetooth devices 
      to measure blood pressure, body weight, and blood glucose and to track activity. 
      They also received a tablet with a mobile internet connection to see the results. 
      The nurses were able to access the results remotely. Regularly executed speed 
      tests and log analysis demonstrated the availability of high-speed mobile 
      internet in the rural test region. Log analysis, surveys, and interviews revealed 
      the suitability of the technology environment and showed that the system was easy 
      to use and potentially useful. The perceived usefulness for supporting mobile 
      care was rated meaningfully low, and the frequency of nurses using the tool 
      declined continuously over the field test period. Further group discussions 
      investigated this issue. CONCLUSIONS: While the technology environment with 
      mobile internet, Bluetooth devices, and smart vital sign monitoring devices was 
      adequate and suitable to support mobile nursing in rural regions, the potential 
      benefit for the nursing organization could not be confirmed. Further analysis 
      revealed that operational care processes did not follow a well-defined care 
      strategy. Technology has the potential to leverage the available environment for 
      developing meaningful solutions. These experiences could contribute to further 
      investigations that need to identify and analyze existing mobile care processes 
      at an organizational level.

TI  - Home-Based Treatment for Chronic Pain Combining Neuromodulation, 
      Computer-Assisted Training, and Telemonitoring in Patients With Breast Cancer: 
      Protocol for a Rehabilitative Study.
PG  - e49508
LID - 10.2196/49508 [doi]
LID - e49508
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic pain is a disabling symptom frequently reported in patients 
      with breast cancer with a prevalence ranging from 25% to 60%, representing a 
      major health issue. It has negative consequences on health status, causing 
      psychological distress and affecting quality of life. Furthermore, the clinical 
      management of chronic pain is often inadequate, and many patients do not benefit 
      from the administration of pharmacological treatments. Alternative therapeutic 
      options have been implemented to improve the psychophysical well-being of 
      patients, including neuromodulation and complementary interventions. OBJECTIVE: 
      We aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a home care strategy combining 
      computerized rehabilitation, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and 
      remote telemonitoring via a web-based platform in patients with breast cancer 
      suffering for chronic pain. METHODS: A web-based structured survey aimed at 
      monitoring chronic pain and its effect on psychological functions will be 
      delivered to patients with breast cancer through social media and email. In 
      total, 42 patients with breast cancer affected by chronic pain will be recruited 
      during the medical screening visit. The patients will be randomly divided into 3 
      treatment groups that will carry out either tDCS only, exercise therapy only, or 
      a combination of both over a 3-week period. All the treatments will be delivered 
      at the patients' home through the use of a system including a tablet, wearable 
      inertial sensors, and a tDCS programmable medical device. Using web-based 
      questionnaires, the perception of pain (based on the pain self-efficacy 
      questionnaire, visual analogue scale, pain catastrophizing scale, and brief pain 
      inventory) and psychological variables (based on the hospital and anxiety 
      depression scale and 12-item short form survey) will be assessed at the beginning 
      of treatment, 1 week after the start of treatment, at the end of treatment, 1 
      month after the start of treatment, and 3 months after the start of treatment. 
      The system's usability (based on the mobile app rating scale and system usability 
      scale) and its involvement in the decision-making process (based on the 9-item 
      shared decision-making questionnaire) will be also evaluated. Finally, at the end 
      of the treatment, a digital focus group will be conducted with the 42 patients to 
      explore their unexpressed needs and preferences concerning treatment. RESULTS: 
      The study project is scheduled to start in June 2023, and it is expected to be 
      completed by August 2025. CONCLUSIONS: We expect that the combination of tDCS and 
      telemedicine programs will reduce pain perceived by patients with breast cancer 
      and improve their mental well-being more effectively than single interventions. 
      Furthermore, we assume that this home-based approach will also improve patients' 
      participation in routine clinical care, reducing disparities in accessing health 
      care processes. This integrated home care strategy could be useful for patients 
      with breast cancer who cannot find relief from chronic pain with pharmacological 
      treatments or for those who have limited access to care due to poor mobility or 
      geographical barriers, thus increasing the patients' empowerment and reducing 
      health care costs. INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID):

TI  - Validity and usability of a smart ball-driven serious game to monitor grip 
      strength in independent elderlies.
PG  - 1952-1968
LID - 10.1177/1460458219895381 [doi]
AB  - Telemonitoring is one of the most expedient answers to the strong need for 
      preventive care imposed by the rapidly aging society. We propose an innovative 
      solution to the detection of early signs of frailty by presenting a serious game 
      controlled by a smart sensorized soft plastic ball, designed to achieve 
      continuous home-based monitoring of muscle weakness in older adults. Design, 
      development, and testing of the smart ball and of the game interface devised to 
      guide the monitoring procedure are presented. Reliability and concurrent validity 
      of the system in measuring maximal grip strength against the clinical standard 
      Jamar(®) were evaluated. Serious game usability and acceptance were investigated 
      on 26 elderlies. Smart ball and Jamar measurements were well correlated (0.76 and 
      0.80 for dominant and non-dominant hands) and test-retest reliability of pressure 
      measurements was excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient >0.94). The 
      serious game was well accepted by the 96.1 percent of participants, who provided 
      a strongly positive usability score (87.7/100). The smart ball-driven serious 
      game demonstrated excellent reliability and good validity in measuring grip 
      strength. The proposed smart ball-driven serious game can be used for home 
      self-monitoring of grip strength in elderlies.

TI  - Issues Associated With the Management and Governance of Sensor Data and 
      Information to Assist Aging in Place: Focus Group Study With Health Care 
      Professionals.
PG  - e24157
LID - 10.2196/24157 [doi]
LID - e24157
AB  - BACKGROUND: Smart home and telemonitoring technologies have often been suggested 
      to assist health care workers in supporting older people to age in place. 
      However, there is limited research examining diverse information needs of 
      different groups of health care workers and their access to appropriate 
      information technologies. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the 
      issues associated with using technologies that connect older people to their 
      health care providers to support aging in place and enhance older people's health 
      and well-being. METHODS: Seven focus group discussions were conducted comprising 
      44 health care professionals who provided clinic-based or in-home services to 
      community-dwelling older people. Participants were asked about their information 
      needs and how technology could help them support older people to age in place. 
      The recordings of the sessions were transcribed and thematically analyzed. 
      RESULTS: The perspectives varied between the respondents who worked in primary 
      care clinics and those who worked in community-based services. Three overarching 
      themes were identified. The first theme was "access to technology and systems," 
      which examined the different levels of technology in use and the problems that 
      various groups of health care professionals had in accessing information about 
      their patients. Primary care professionals had access to good internal 
      information systems but they experienced poor integration with other health care 
      providers. The community-based teams had poor access to technology. The second 
      theme was "collecting and sharing of information," which focused on how 
      technology might be used to provide them with more information about their 
      patients. Primary care teams were interested in telemonitoring for specific 
      clinical indicators but they wanted the information to be preprocessed. 
      Community-based teams were more concerned about gaining information on the 
      patients' social environment. The third theme was that all respondents identified 
      similar "barriers to uptake": cost and funding issues, usability of systems by 
      older people, and information security and privacy concerns. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      participants perceived the potential benefits of technologies, but they were 
      concerned that the information they received should be preprocessed and 
      integrated with current information systems and tailored to the older people's 
      unique and changing situations. Several management and governance issues were 
      identified, which needed to be resolved to enable the widespread integration of 
      these technologies into the health care system. The disconnected nature of the 
      current information architecture means that there is no clear way for sensor data 
      from telemonitoring and smart home devices to be integrated with other patient 
      information. Furthermore, cost, privacy, security, and usability barriers also 
      need to be resolved. This study highlights the importance and the complexity of 
      management and governance of systems to collect and disseminate such information. 
      Further research into the requirements of all stakeholder groups and how the 
      information can be processed and disseminated is required.

TI  - Usability of the REHOME Solution for the Telerehabilitation in Neurological 
      Diseases: Preliminary Results on Motor and Cognitive Platforms.

AB  - The progressive aging of the population and the consequent growth of individuals 
      with neurological diseases and related chronic disabilities, will lead to a 
      general increase in the costs and resources needed to ensure treatment and care 
      services. In this scenario, telemedicine and e-health solutions, including remote 
      monitoring and rehabilitation, are attracting increasing interest as tools to 
      ensure the sustainability of the healthcare system or, at least, to support the 
      burden for health care facilities. Technological advances in recent decades have 
      fostered the development of dedicated and innovative Information and 
      Communication Technology (ICT) based solutions, with the aim of complementing 
      traditional care and treatment services through telemedicine applications that 
      support new patient and disease management strategies. This is the background for 
      the REHOME project, whose technological solution, presented in this paper, 
      integrates innovative methodologies and devices for remote monitoring and 
      rehabilitation of cognitive, motor, and sleep disorders associated with 
      neurological diseases. One of the primary goals of the project is to meet the 
      needs of patients and clinicians, by ensuring continuity of treatment from 
      healthcare facilities to the patient's home. To this end, it is important to 
      ensure the usability of the solution by elderly and pathological individuals. 
      Preliminary results of usability and user experience questionnaires on 70 
      subjects recruited in three experimental trials are presented here.

TI  - Digital health care solution for proactive heart failure management with the 
      Cordella Heart Failure System: results of the SIRONA first-in-human study.
PG  - 1912-1919
LID - 10.1002/ejhf.1870 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Incorporation of remote monitoring of pulmonary artery pressure and vital 
      signs has been demonstrated to reduce heart failure (HF) hospitalization and 
      all-cause mortality in selected symptomatic HF patients. The aim of this study is 
      to investigate the safety and accuracy of the new Cordella(TM) Pulmonary Artery 
      Pressure Sensor (Endotronix, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and the usability of the 
      comprehensive Cordella(TM) Heart Failure System (CHFS). METHODS AND RESULTS: 
      Multicentre, open-label, first-in-human, feasibility study to evaluate the CHFS 
      and the safety and accuracy of the Cordella™ Pulmonary Artery Pressure Sensor in 
      15 patients with New York Heart Association class III HF. All patients were 
      successfully implanted with the Cordella Pulmonary Artery Pressure Sensor, 
      without sensor failure. No device system-related complications, defined as 
      invasive treatment, device explant or death, occurred. The primary efficacy 
      endpoint of a mean pulmonary artery pressure at 90 days was met in all but one 
      patients with a cohort difference of 2.7 mmHg (Cordella Sensor 22.5 ± 11.8 mmHg, 
      Swan-Ganz catheter 25.2 ± 8.5 mmHg). One patient did not go through the 90-day 
      right heart catheterization for safety reasons. Patient adherence to daily 
      measurement, transmission of vital signs and pulmonary artery pressure sensor 
      readings were recorded 99% of the time. CONCLUSION: The initial experience of the 
      CHFS incorporating comprehensive vital signs and pulmonary artery pressure 
      monitoring enables safe and accurate monitoring of HF status.

TI  - Assessing the use of a noninvasive monitoring system providing multiple 
      cardio-pulmonary parameters following revascularization in STEMI patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Continuous monitoring of ECG, respiratory rate, systolic and 
      diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, cardiac output, and cardiac index is 
      important in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) admitted to 
      the intensive cardiac care unit (ICCU). However, monitoring these parameters in 
      this setting and in these patients using noninvasive, wireless devices has not 
      been conducted so far. We aimed to assess the use of a novel noninvasive 
      continuous monitoring device in STEMI patients admitted to the ICCU. METHODS: 
      Participants included STEMI patients that were admitted to the ICCU after primary 
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI). Patients were continuously monitored 
      using a novel wearable chest patch monitor. RESULTS: Fifteen patients with STEMI 
      who underwent PPCI were included in this study. The median age was 52.8 years, 
      the majority were males, and the median body mass index (BMI) was 25.7. 
      Monitoring lasted for 66  ±  16 hours, and included the automatic collection and 
      recording of all vitals, freeing the nursing staff to focus on other tasks. The 
      user experience of nurses as reflected in filled questionnaires showed high 
      satisfaction rates in all aspects. CONCLUSION: A novel noninvasive, wireless 
      device showed high feasibility in continuously monitoring multiple crucial 
      parameters in STEMI patients admitted to the ICCU after PPCI.

TI  - Support Through Remote Observation and Nutrition Guidance (STRONG), a digital 
      health intervention to reduce malnutrition among pancreatic cancer patients: A 
      study protocol for a pilot randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 101271
LID - 10.1016/j.conctc.2024.101271 [doi]
LID - 101271
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malnutrition is a common and distressing condition among pancreatic 
      cancer patients. Fewer than a quarter of pancreatic cancer patients receive 
      medical nutrition therapy (MNT), important for improving nutritional status, 
      weight maintenance, quality of life and survival. System, provider, and patient 
      level barriers limit access to MNT. We propose to examine the feasibility of a 
      12-week multi-level, digital health intervention designed to expand MNT access 
      among pancreatic cancer patients. METHODS: Individuals with advanced pancreatic 
      cancer starting chemotherapy (N = 80) will be 1:1 randomized to the intervention 
      or usual care. The Support Through Remote Observation and Nutrition Guidance 
      (STRONG) intervention includes system-level (e.g., routine malnutrition and 
      screening), provider-level (e.g., dietitian training and web-based dashboard), 
      and patient-level strategies (e.g., individualized nutrition plan, 
      self-monitoring of dietary intake via Fitbit, ongoing goal monitoring and 
      feedback). Individuals receiving usual care will be referred to dietitians based 
      on their oncologists' discretion. Study assessments will be completed at 
      baseline, 4-, 8-, 12-, and 16-weeks. RESULTS: Primary outcomes will be 
      feasibility (e.g., recruitment, retention, assessment completion) and 
      acceptability. We will collect additional implementation outcomes, such as 
      intervention adherence, perceived usability, and feedback on intervention quality 
      via an exit interview. We will collect preliminary data on outcomes that may be 
      associated with the intervention including malnutrition, quality of life, 
      treatment outcomes, and survival. CONCLUSION: This study will advance our 
      knowledge on the feasibility of a digital health intervention to reduce 
      malnutrition among individuals with advanced pancreatic cancer. Trial 
      registration: NCT05675059, registered on December 9, 2022.

TI  - A Scalable System for Passively Monitoring Oral Health Behaviors Using Electronic 
      Toothbrushes in the Home Setting: Development and Feasibility Study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dental disease (including dental caries and periodontal disease) is 
      largely preventable and closely linked to inadequate oral health behaviors. 
      Digital health technologies have great potential for unobtrusively monitoring 
      brushing behaviors in home settings and promoting optimal oral self-care routines 
      at scale. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to leverage the ubiquity of 
      electronic toothbrushes and smartphones with the development of a Remote Oral 
      Behaviors Assessment System (ROBAS) and evaluate its feasibility for passively 
      tracking brushing behaviors in real-world settings. METHODS: We developed ROBAS 
      by linking inertial sensors contained within consumer electronic toothbrushes to 
      a scalable software platform comprised of a smartphone app linked to a cloud 
      platform. First, the criterion validity of ROBAS for accurately capturing 
      brushing details was established in a laboratory setting. Next, real-world 
      performance and usability were evaluated in a stratified community sample of 32 
      participants who used ROBAS daily for 1 month and maintained a diary of their 
      brushing episodes. Semistructured interviews at baseline and exit captured the 
      user experience. We used regression models and Bland-Altman analyses to assess 
      the criterion validity, functionality, accuracy, and consistency of ROBAS. 
      RESULTS: Using a stopwatch as the criterion reference, ROBAS showed a mean 
      absolute percent error (MAPE) of 1.8%, an estimated bias of 0.64 seconds that was 
      not statistically distinguishable from zero (95% CI -0.93 to 2.22 seconds, SE 
      0.79), and a connection failure rate of 6.7% (95% CI 0.8%-22.1%, SE 4.6%). In 
      real-world testing, ROBAS showed close agreement with the daily diary recordings 
      of brushing episodes; estimated average discrepancies between the diary and ROBAS 
      were 0.13 sessions per day (95% CI 0.01-0.26, SE 0.06), 8.0 seconds per brushing 
      session (95% CI 1.4-14.7, SE 3.3), and 30 seconds of brushing per day (95% CI 
      9.3-50.1, SE 10.0). Retrospective self-reports produced substantially higher 
      estimates of brushing frequency and duration compared to ROBAS measurements. 
      Participants reported ROBAS was easy to use and expressed an interest in 
      receiving ROBAS-delivered feedback on their brushing behaviors. Most participants 
      were bothered by the use of an additional study phone, and some reported 
      connectivity-related issues. CONCLUSIONS: ROBAS has a high criterion validity for 
      measuring oral health behaviors. It can accurately and reliably monitor brushing 
      patterns in home settings for extended periods. Unobtrusive data collection 
      through ROBAS sets the stage for automated coaching and optimization of oral 
      self-care practices at the individual and population level.

TI  - "Listen to Your Immune System When It's Calling for You": Monitoring Autoimmune 
      Diseases Using the iShU App.
LID - 10.3390/s22103834 [doi]
LID - 3834
AB  - The immune system plays a key role in protecting living beings against bacteria, 
      viruses, and fungi, among other pathogens, which may be harmful and represent a 
      threat to our own health. However, for reasons that are not fully understood, in 
      some people this protective mechanism accidentally attacks the organs and 
      tissues, thus causing inflammation and leads to the development of autoimmune 
      diseases. Remote monitoring of human health involves the use of sensor network 
      technology as a means of capturing patient data, and wearable devices, such as 
      smartwatches, have lately been considered good collectors of biofeedback data, 
      owing to their easy connectivity with a mHealth system. Moreover, the use of 
      gamification may encourage the frequent usage of such devices and behavior 
      changes to improve self-care for autoimmune diseases. This study reports on the 
      use of wearable sensors for inflammation surveillance and autoimmune disease 
      management based on a literature search and evaluation of an app prototype with 
      fifteen stakeholders, in which eight participants were diagnosed with autoimmune 
      or inflammatory diseases and four were healthcare professionals. Of these, six 
      were experts in human-computer interaction to assess critical aspects of user 
      experience. The developed prototype allows the monitoring of autoimmune diseases 
      in pre-, during-, and post-inflammatory crises, meeting the personal needs of 
      people with this health condition. The findings suggest that the proposed 
      prototype-iShU-achieves its purpose and the overall experience may serve as a 
      foundation for designing inflammation surveillance and autoimmune disease 
      management monitoring solutions.

TI  - Performance of an eHealth (NOMHAD) System Comprising Telemonitoring, 
      Telenotification, and Telecoaching for Patients With Multimorbidity: 
      Proof-of-Concept Study.
PG  - e32205
LID - 10.2196/32205 [doi]
LID - e32205
AB  - BACKGROUND: Management of patients with multiple chronic diseases is a growing 
      public health challenge, especially in rural sectors where access to physicians 
      may be limited. Connected medical devices monitoring vital signs, associated with 
      eHealth program and structured telephone support, may improve complex patient 
      management through early detection of disease complications, positive impact on 
      patients' health, and health resources consumption optimization. OBJECTIVE: The 
      aim of this study was to evaluate the technical performance and user experience 
      of the NOMHAD eHealth system in patients with multimorbidity. METHODS: This was a 
      pilot, single-arm, interventional study. Patients with multimorbidity with any 
      combination of chronic heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary 
      disease, and diabetes were followed for 80-100 days using the NOMHAD eHealth 
      system. This system used connected devices telemonitoring symptoms and vital 
      signs (eg, body weight, oxygen saturation, pulse rate, blood pressure, and blood 
      glucose), associated with structured telecoaching and educational support by call 
      center nurses. An overall risk indicator (ORI) was automatically computed after 
      each data teletransmission. The ORI was color coded; green indicated no action 
      required; yellow, orange, and red (low to high priority, respectively) generated 
      telenotifications and indicated to the nurses the need for a telecoaching action. 
      Each ORI was calculated by combining 7 clinical stability system indicators based 
      on symptom questionnaires and vital signs. Technical accuracy of the system was 
      assessed by comparing system-generated ORIs with ORIs recalculated from raw data. 
      Ease of use, usefulness, satisfaction, and acceptability of the system were 
      assessed through patient adherence to self-assessments, and through 
      self-administered questionnaires to patients, call center nurses, and physicians. 
      RESULTS: A total of 23 patients were enrolled in this study and participated 
      between April 2016 and March 2017 at 5 study centers in France. All patients were 
      successfully equipped and evaluable for analysis. Mean age was 68.5 (SD 10.4) 
      years and most patients were men (n=20). The most common multimorbidity was CHF + 
      diabetes (n=15), followed by patients with all 3 diseases (n=5). Mean effective 
      follow-up was 78.7 (SD 24.2) days. The system generated 6263 ORIs, as several 
      ORIs could be generated on a single day for any patient. Overall system 
      sensitivity was 99.2% (95% CI 98.9-99.4) and overall specificity was 91.3% (95% 
      CI 87.7-94.1). Most patients (20/23, 87%) were satisfied with the system and 
      agreed that it helped them to better understand and manage their diseases, and 
      19/23 (83%) valued the nurse regular contacts. Nurses and physicians were 
      generally satisfied with the system and considered it useful. All users indicated 
      they would agree to long-term use of the system. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides 
      evidence that the NOMHAD eHealth system is accurate, acceptable, informative, and 
      feasible for patients with multimorbidity, supporting further investigation of 
      its clinical benefits. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Agence Nationale de Sécurité du

      perspective.
PG  - e30001

AB  - This study primarily aimed to explore the capabilities of digitalisation in the 
      healthcare context, focusing on a specific disease. In this case, the study 
      examined the potential of remote monitoring of gait to address the sensitivity of 
      multiple sclerosis progression to gait characteristics by adopting a non-invasive 
      approach to remotely quantify gait disturbances in a patient's daily life. To 
      better understand the managerial aspects associated with this approach, the 
      researchers conducted a literature review along with a set of semi-structured 
      interviews. The target population included MS patients as well as the key agents 
      involved in their care: patients' family members, neurologists, MS nurses, 
      physiotherapists, medical directors, and pharmacist. The study identifies the 
      perceived barriers and drivers that could contribute to the successful deployment 
      of PSS remote gait monitoring as a healthcare service: i) At mega-level 
      governance. Implications on privacy and security data are notable barriers 
      missing on the speech. ii) At macro level, funding is highlighted as main 
      barrier. The cost and lack of health system subsidies may render initiatives 
      unsustainable, as emphasised by the interviewees. iii) At meso level, useable 
      data is recognised as a driver. The data collection process can align with 
      diverse interests to create value and business opportunities for the ecosystem 
      actors, enhance care, attract stakeholders, such as insurers and pharma, and form 
      partnerships. iv) At micro-level processes, we find two potential barriers: 
      wearable device and app usability (comfort, navigation, efficiency) and 
      organisational/behavioural aspects (training, digital affinity, skills), which 
      are crucial for value creation in innovation ecosystems among patients and 
      healthcare professionals. Finally, we find an interesting gap in the literature 
      and interviews. Stakeholders' limited awareness of technological demands, 
      especially from information technologies, for a successful long-term service, can 
      be consider two key barriers for PSS.

AB  - Although conventional skin-attachable electronics exhibit good functionalities, 
      their direct attachment (without any adhesive) to human skin with sufficient 
      conformal contact is challenging. Herein, all-solution-processed on-skin 
      electronics based on self-reconfigurable high-weight-per- volume-gelatin (HWVG) 
      film constructed using an effective, biocompatible water absorption-evaporation 
      technique are demonstrated. Completely conformal contact of self-reconfigurable 
      HWVG films is realized by rapidly inducing anisotropic swelling in the 
      perpendicular direction and covering any curvature on the skin without spatial 
      gap or void after shrinking. A sufficiently thin HWVG film (~2 um) exhibited 
      higher adhesion owing to van der Waals force and the carboxylic acid and amine 
      groups in HWVG film form cross-linkages through intermolecular bonds with human 
      skin. Self-reconfigurable HWVG films with high biocompatibility are optimized to 
      afford a superior efficiency of 87.83 % at a concentration of 20 % (w/v) and a 
      storage modulus of 1822 MPa at 36.5 °C. Furthermore, functional nanoelectrodes 
      consisting of self-reconfigurable silver nanowires/HWVG films for 
      high-performance on-skin sensors allowing the detection of sensitive motion and 
      electrophysiological signals, as well as an armband-type sensor system 
      incorporated with a smartphone for health-care monitoring are demonstrated. 
      Outstanding performances, including stability, reliability, flexibility, 
      re-usability, biocompatibility, and permeability of on-skin electronics based on 
      HWVG films can open-up a prospective route to realizing breathable human-machine 
      interfaces based on biocompatible materials and processes.

TI  - A Digital System (YouXin) to Facilitate Self-Management by People With Psychosis 
      in China: Protocol for a Nonrandomized Validity and Feasibility Study With a 
      Mixed Methods Design.
PG  - e45170

AB  - BACKGROUND: Psychosis is one of the most disabling mental health conditions and 
      causes significant personal, social, and economic burden. Accurate and timely 
      symptom monitoring is critical to offering prompt and time-sensitive clinical 
      services. Digital health is a promising solution for the barriers encountered by 
      conventional symptom monitoring approaches, including accessibility, the 
      ecological validity of assessments, and recall bias. However, to date, there has 
      been no digital health technology developed to support self-management for people 
      with psychosis in China. OBJECTIVE: We report the study protocol to evaluate the 
      validity, feasibility, acceptability, usability, and safety of a symptom 
      self-monitoring smartphone app (YouXin; Chinese name ) for people with psychosis 
      in China. METHODS: This is a nonrandomized validity and feasibility study with a 
      mixed methods design. The study was approved by the University of Manchester and 
      Beijing Anding Hospital Research Ethics Committee. YouXin is a smartphone app 
      designed to facilitate symptom self-monitoring for people with psychosis. YouXin 
      has 2 core functions: active monitoring of symptoms (ie, smartphone survey) and 
      passive monitoring of behavioral activity (ie, passive data collection via 
      embedded smartphone sensors). The development process of YouXin utilized a 
      systematic coproduction approach. A series of coproduction consultation meetings 
      was conducted by the principal researcher with service users and clinicians to 
      maximize the usability and acceptability of the app for end users. Participants 
      with psychosis aged 16 years to 65 years were recruited from Beijing Anding 
      Hospital, Beijing, China. All participants were invited to use the YouXin app to 
      self-monitor symptoms for 4 weeks. At the end of the 4-week follow-up, we invited 
      participants to take part in a qualitative interview to explore the acceptability 
      of the app and trial procedures postintervention. RESULTS: Recruitment to the 
      study was initiated in August 2022. Of the 47 participants who were approached 
      for the study from August 2022 to October 2022, 41 participants agreed to take 
      part in the study. We excluded 1 of the 41 participants for not meeting the 
      inclusion criteria, leaving a total of 40 participants who began the study. As of 
      December 2022, 40 participants had completed the study, and the recruitment was 
      complete. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to develop and test a symptom 
      self-monitoring app specifically designed for people with psychosis in China. If 
      the study shows the feasibility of YouXin, a potential future direction is to 
      integrate the app into clinical workflows to facilitate digital mental health 
      care for people with psychosis in China. This study will inform improvements to 
      the app, trial procedures, and implementation strategies with this population. 
      Moreover, the findings of this trial could lead to optimization of digital health 
      technologies designed for people with psychosis in China. INTERNATIONAL

TI  - Feasibility, Acceptability, and Preliminary Effectiveness of a Combined Digital 
      Platform and Community Health Worker Intervention for Patients With Heart 
      Failure: Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - e59948
LID - 10.2196/59948 [doi]
LID - e59948
AB  - BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is a burdensome condition and a leading cause of 
      30-day hospital readmissions in the United States. Clinical and social factors 
      are key drivers of hospitalization. These 2 strategies, digital platforms and 
      home-based social needs care, have shown preliminary effectiveness in improving 
      adherence to clinical care plans and reducing acute care use in HF. Few studies, 
      if any, have tested combining these 2 strategies in a single intervention. 
      OBJECTIVE: This study aims to perform a pilot randomized controlled trial 
      assessing the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary effectiveness of a 
      30-day digitally-enabled community health worker (CHW) intervention in HF. 
      METHODS: Adults hospitalized with a diagnosis of HF at an academic hospital were 
      randomly assigned to receive digitally-enabled CHW care (intervention; digital 
      platform +CHW) or CHW-enhanced usual care (control; CHW only) for 30 days after 
      hospital discharge. Primary outcomes were feasibility (use of the platform) and 
      acceptability (willingness to use the platform in the future). Secondary outcomes 
      assessed preliminary effectiveness (30-day readmissions, emergency department 
      visits, and missed clinic appointments). RESULTS: A total of 56 participants were 
      randomized (control: n=31; intervention: n=25) and 47 participants (control: 
      n=28; intervention: n=19) completed all trial activities. Intervention 
      participants who completed trial activities wore the digital sensor on 78% of 
      study days with mean use of 11.4 (SD 4.6) hours/day, completed symptom 
      questionnaires on 75% of study days, used the blood pressure monitor 1.1 (SD 
      0.19) times/day, and used the digital weight scale 1 (SD 0.13) time/day. Of 
      intervention participants, 100% responded very or somewhat true to the statement 
      "If I have access to the [platform] moving forward, I will use it." Some (n=9, 
      47%) intervention participants indicated they required support to use the digital 
      platform. A total of 19 (100%) intervention participants and 25 (89%) control 
      participants had ≥5 CHW interactions during the 30-day study period. All 
      intervention (n=19, 100%) and control (n=26, 93%) participants who completed 
      trial activities indicated their CHW interactions were "very satisfying." In the 
      full sample (N=56), fewer participants in the intervention group were readmitted 
      30 days after hospital discharge compared to the control group (n=3, 12% vs n=8, 
      26%; P=.12). Both arms had similar rates of missed clinic appointments and 
      emergency department visits. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot trial of a digitally-enabled 
      CHW intervention for HF demonstrated feasibility, acceptability, and a clinically 
      relevant reduction in 30-day readmissions among participants who received the 
      intervention. Additional investigation is needed in a larger trial to determine 
      the effect of this intervention on HF home management and clinical outcomes.

TI  - A Smart Shoe Insole to Monitor Frail Older Adults' Walking Speed: Results of Two 
      Evaluation Phases Completed in a Living Lab and Through a 12-Week Pilot Study.
PG  - e15641
LID - 10.2196/15641 [doi]
LID - e15641
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent World Health Organization reports propose wearable devices to 
      collect information on activity and walking speed as innovative health 
      indicators. However, mainstream consumer-grade tracking devices and smartphone 
      apps are often inaccurate and require long-term acceptability assessment. 
      OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to assess the user acceptability of an instrumented shoe 
      insole in frail older adults. This device monitors participants' walking speed 
      and differentiates active walking from shuffling after step length calibration. 
      METHODS: A multiphase evaluation has been designed: 9 older adults were evaluated 
      in a living lab for a day, 3 older adults were evaluated at home for a month, and 
      a prospective randomized trial included 35 older adults at home for 3 months. A 
      qualitative research design using face-to-face and phone semistructured 
      interviews was performed. Our hypothesis was that this shoe insole was acceptable 
      in monitoring long-term outdoor and indoor walking. The primary outcome was 
      participants' acceptability, measured by a qualitative questionnaire and average 
      time of insole wearing per day. The secondary outcome described physical frailty 
      evolution in both groups. RESULTS: Living lab results confirmed the importance of 
      a multiphase design study with participant involvement. Participants proposed 
      insole modifications. Overall acceptability had mixed results: low scores for 
      reliability (2.1 out of 6) and high scores for usability (4.3 out of 6) outcomes. 
      The calibration phase raised no particular concern. During the field test, a 
      majority of participants (mean age 79 years) were very (10/16) or quite satisfied 
      (3/16) with the insole's comfort at the end of the follow-up. Participant insole 
      acceptability evolved as follows: 63% (12/19) at 1 month, 50% (9/18) at 2 months, 
      and 75% (12/16) at 3 months. A total of 9 participants in the intervention group 
      discontinued the intervention because of technical issues. All participants 
      equipped for more than a week reported wearing the insole every day at 1 month, 
      83% (15/18) at 2 months, and 94% (15/16) at 3 months for 5.8, 6.3, and 5.1 hours 
      per day, respectively. Insole data confirmed that participants effectively wore 
      the insole without significant decline during follow-up for an average of 13.5 
      days per 4 months and 5.6 hours per day. For secondary end points, the change in 
      frailty parameters or quality of life did not differ for those randomly assigned 
      to the intervention group compared to usual care. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reports 
      acceptability data on an instrumented insole in indoor and outdoor walking with 
      remote monitoring in frail older adults under real-life conditions. To date, 
      there is limited data in this population set. This thin instrumentation, 
      including a flexible battery, was a technical challenge and seems to provide an 
      acceptable solution over time that is valued by participants. However, users 
      still raised certain acceptability issues. Given the growing interest in wearable 
      health care devices, these results will be useful for future developments. TRIAL

AB  - BACKGROUND: Multi-parametric assessment, including heart sounds in addition to 
      conventional parameters, may enhance the efficacy of noninvasive telemonitoring 
      for heart failure (HF). We sought to assess the feasibility of 
      self-telemonitoring with multiple devices including a handheld heart sound 
      recorder and its association with clinical events in patients with HF. METHODS: 
      Ambulatory HF patients recorded their own heart sounds, mono‑lead 
      electrocardiograms, oxygen saturation, body weight, and vital signs using 
      multiple devices every morning for six months. RESULTS: In the 77 patients 
      enrolled (63 ± 13 years old, 84 % male), daily measurements were feasible with a 
      self-measurement rate of >70 % of days in 75 % of patients. Younger age and 
      higher Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire scores were 
      independently associated with lower adherence (p = 0.002 and 0.027, 
      respectively). A usability questionnaire showed that 87 % of patients felt 
      self-telemonitoring was helpful, and 96 % could use the devices without routine 
      cohabitant support. Six patients experienced ten HF events of re-hospitalization 
      and/or unplanned hospital visits due to HF. In patients who experienced HF 
      events, a significant increase in heart rate and diastolic blood pressure and a 
      decrease in the time interval from Q wave onset to the second heart sound were 
      observed 7 days before the events compared with those without HF events. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Self-telemonitoring with multiple devices including a handheld heart 
      sound recorder was feasible even in elderly patients with HF. This intervention 
      may confer a sense of relief to patients and enable monitoring of physiological 
      parameters that could be valuable in detecting the deterioration of HF.

TI  - Home Blood Pressure Telemonitoring Technology for Patients With Asymptomatic 
      Elevated Blood Pressure Discharged From the Emergency Department: Pilot Study.
PG  - e49592
LID - 10.2196/49592 [doi]
LID - e49592
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension affects 1 in 5 Canadians and is the leading cause of 
      morbidity and mortality globally. Hypertension control is declining due to 
      multiple factors including lack of access to primary care. Consequently, patients 
      with hypertension frequently visit the emergency department (ED) due to high 
      blood pressure (BP). Telehealth for Emergency-Community Continuity of Care 
      Connectivity via Home-Telemonitoring Blood Pressure is a pilot project that 
      implements and evaluates a comprehensive home blood pressure telemonitoring 
      (HBPT) and physician case management protocol designed as a postdischarge 
      management strategy to support patients with asymptomatic elevated BP as they 
      transition from the ED to home. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to conduct a 
      feasibility study of an HBPT program for patients with asymptomatic elevated BP 
      discharged from the ED. METHODS: Patients discharged from an urban, tertiary care 
      hospital ED with asymptomatic elevated BP were recruited in Vancouver, British 
      Columbia, Canada, and provided with HBPT technology for 3 months of monitoring 
      post discharge and referred to specialist hypertension clinics. Participants 
      monitored their BP twice in the morning and evenings and tele-transmitted 
      readings via Bluetooth Sensor each day using an app. A monitoring clinician 
      received these data and monitored the patient's condition daily and adjusted 
      antihypertensive medications. Feasibility outcomes included eligibility, 
      recruitment, adherence to monitoring, and retention rates. Secondary outcomes 
      included proportion of those who were defined as having hypertension post-ED 
      visits, changes in mean BP, overall BP control, medication adherence, changes to 
      antihypertensive medications, quality of life, and end user experience at 3 
      months. RESULTS: A total of 46 multiethnic patients (mean age 63, SD 17 years, 
      69%, n=32 women) found to have severe hypertension (mean 191, SD 23/mean 100, SD 
      14 mm Hg) in the ED were recruited, initiated on HBPT with hypertension 
      specialist physician referral and followed up for 3 months. Eligibility and 
      recruitment rates were 40% (56/139) and 88% (49/56), respectively. The proportion 
      of participants that completed ≥80% of home BP measurements at 1 and 3 months 
      were 67% (31/46) and 41% (19/46), respectively. The proportion of individuals who 
      achieved home systolic BP and diastolic BP control at 3 months was 71.4% (30/42) 
      and 85.7% (36/42) respectively. Mean home systolic and diastolic BP improved by 
      -13/-5 mm Hg after initiation of HBPT to the end of the study. Patients were 
      prescribed 1 additional antihypertensive medication. No differences in medication 
      adherence from enrollment to 3 months were noted. Most patients (76%, 25/33) were 
      highly satisfied with the HBPT program and 76% (25/33) found digital health tools 
      easy to use. CONCLUSIONS: HBPT intervention is a feasible postdischarge 
      management strategy and can be beneficial in supporting patients with 
      asymptomatic elevated BP from the ED. A randomized trial is underway to evaluate 
      the efficacy of this intervention on BP control.

TI  - Effectiveness of current perioperative telemonitoring on postoperative outcome in 
      patients undergoing major abdominal surgery: A systematic review of controlled 
      trials.
PG  - 215-229
LID - 10.1177/1357633X211047710 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Perioperative telemonitoring of patients undergoing major surgery 
      might lead to improved postoperative outcomes. The aim of this systematic review 
      is to evaluate the effectiveness of current perioperative telemonitoring 
      interventions on postoperative clinical, patient-reported, and financial outcome 
      measures in patients undergoing major surgery. METHODS: For this systematic 
      review, PubMed, CINAHL, and Embase databases were searched for eligible articles 
      published between January 1, 2009 and March 15, 2021. Studies were eligible as 
      they described: (P) patients aged 18 years or older who underwent major abdominal 
      surgery, (I) perioperative telemonitoring as intervention, (C) a control group 
      receiving usual care, (O) any type of postoperative clinical, patient-reported, 
      or financial outcome measures, and (S) an interventional study design. RESULTS: 
      The search identified 2958 articles of which 10 were eligible for analysis, 
      describing nine controlled trials of 2438 patients. Perioperative telemonitoring 
      comprised wearable biosensors (n = 3), websites (n = 3), e-mail (n = 1), and 
      mobile applications (n = 2). Outcome measures were clinical (n = 8), 
      patient-reported (n = 5), and financial (n = 2). Results show significant 
      improvement of recovery time, stoma self-efficacy and pain in the early 
      postoperative phase in patients receiving telemonitoring. Other outcome measures 
      were not significantly different between the groups. CONCLUSION: Evidence for the 
      effectiveness of perioperative telemonitoring in major surgery is scarce. There 
      is a need for good quality studies with sufficient patients while ensuring that 
      the quality and usability of the technology and the adoption in care processes 
      are optimal.

AB  - PURPOSE: The potential of combining teledentistry and engaging parents as 
      underutilised resources to monitor paediatric dental health was emphasised during 
      the COVID-19 pandemic and remains underexplored. This study aims to assess 
      parental acceptance and use of a commercially available intraoral camera (IOC) 
      for effective remote monitoring. METHODS: 47 child-parent dyads, where the parent 
      was the main caregiver and the child was treated under general anaesthesia for 
      early childhood caries, were recruited. Caregivers were trained to image their 
      child's teeth on a commercially available IOC. Subsequently, submitted images 
      were reviewed asynchronously by dentists for image quality, presence of dislodged 
      fillings, abscesses, cavitation, and oral hygiene. Post-surgery monitoring was 
      performed using teledentistry at 1 and 2 months and in-person at 4 months. A 
      modified Telehealth Usability Questionnaire (TUQ) was used to record caregiver 
      acceptance for study procedures. RESULTS: A mean TUQ of 6.09 out of 7 was scored 
      by caregivers. Caregiver-reported issues were limited to problems with technique 
      and child uncooperativeness. The number of clear images during the second 
      teledentistry review was improved compared to the first (p = 0.007). 68% of 
      children liked having images of their teeth taken. CONCLUSION: This study 
      supports the feasibility of using an IOC as a clinically appropriate avenue for 
      teledentistry with a high level of caregiver-child acceptance.

TI  - SPHYNCS: Feasibility of long-term monitoring with Fitbit smartwatches in central 
      disorders of hypersomnolence and extraction of digital biomarkers in narcolepsy.

AB  - The Swiss Primary Hypersomnolence and Narcolepsy Cohort Study (SPHYNCS) is a 
      multicenter research initiative to identify new biomarkers in central disorders 
      of hypersomnolence (CDH). Whereas narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) is well characterized, 
      other CDH disorders lack precise biomarkers. In SPHYNCS, we utilized Fitbit 
      smartwatches to monitor physical activity, heart rate, and sleep parameters over 
      one year. We examined the feasibility of long-term ambulatory monitoring using 
      the wearable device. We then explored digital biomarkers differentiating patients 
      with NT1 from healthy controls (HC). A total of 115 participants received a 
      Fitbit smartwatch. Using a compliance metric to evaluate the usability of the 
      wearable device, we found an overall compliance rate of 80% over one year. We 
      calculated daily physical activity, heart rate, and sleep parameters from two 
      weeks of greatest compliance to compare NT1 (n=20) and HC (n=9) subjects. 
      Compared to controls, NT1 patients demonstrated findings consistent with 
      increased sleep fragmentation, including significantly greater wake-after-sleep 
      onset (p=0.007) and awakening index (p=0.025), as well as standard deviation of 
      time in bed (p=0.044). Moreover, NT1 patients exhibited a significantly shorter 
      REM latency (p=0.019), and sleep latency (p=0.001), as well as a lower peak heart 
      rate (p=0.008), heart rate standard deviation (p=0.039) and high-intensity 
      activity (p=0.009) compared to HC. This ongoing study demonstrates the 
      feasibility of long-term monitoring with wearable technology in patients with CDH 
      and potentially identifies a digital biomarker profile for NT1. While further 
      validation is needed in larger datasets, these data suggest that long-term 
      wearable technology may play a future role in diagnosing and managing narcolepsy.

TI  - The evaluation of a decision support system integrating assistive technology for 
      people with dementia at home.
PG  - 1400624
LID - 10.3389/frdem.2024.1400624 [doi]
LID - 1400624
AB  - INTRODUCTION: With a decreasing workforce of carers and a transition from care 
      homes to home care, people with dementia (PwD) increasingly rely on informal 
      caregivers (ICs) and assistive technologies (ATs). There is growing evidence that 
      ATs in the home environment can reduce workload for formal carers (FCs) and ICs, 
      reduce care costs, and can have a positive influence on quality of life (QoL) for 
      PwD and their caregivers. In practice, using multiple ATs still often implies 
      using different separate point solutions and applications. However, the integral, 
      combined use of the data generated using various applications can potentially 
      enhance the insight into the health and wellbeing status of PwD and can provide 
      decision support for carers. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the 
      use of a DSS that integrated multiple ATs into one dashboard through a 
      small-scale field study. METHODS: The current study presents the formative 
      evaluation of a Decision Support System (DSS) connected to multiple ATs. This DSS 
      has been developed by means of co-creation during an international project. The 
      DSS provides an insight into the physical and cognitive status of a PwD, as well 
      as an insight into sleep activity and general wellbeing. Semi-structured 
      interview sessions were held in three countries (Netherlands, Italy, and Taiwan) 
      with 41 participants to gain insight into the experiences of formal and informal 
      carers and PwD with both the ATs and the DSS Alpha prototype dashboard. RESULTS: 
      The results showed that participants using the DSS were satisfied and perceived 
      added value and a fit with certain care demands from the PwD. In general, ICs and 
      FCs have limited insight into the status of PwD living independently at home, and 
      in these moments, the DSS dashboard and AT bundle can provide valuable insights. 
      Participants experienced the DSS dashboard as well-organized and easy to 
      navigate. The accuracy of the data displayed in the dashboard is important, the 
      context, and (perceived) privacy issues should be tackled according to all users. 
      Furthermore, based in the insight gained during the evaluation a set of design 
      improvements was composed which can be used to further improve the DSS for the 
      Beta evaluation. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The current paper evaluates a 
      possible solution for excess AT usage and how the use of a DSS which integrated 
      multiple AT into one single technology could support caregivers in providing care 
      for PwD. The formative evaluation scrutinized the integration of the developed 
      DSS and the composed bundle of ATs across diverse cultural contexts. Insights 
      from multi-center observations shed light on user experiences, encompassing 
      overall usability, navigational efficacy, and attitudes toward the system. FCs 
      and ICs expressed positivity toward the DSS dashboard's design and 
      functionalities, highlighting its utility in remote monitoring, tracking changes 
      in the person's abilities, and managing urgent situations. There is a need for 
      personalized solutions and the findings contribute to a nuanced understanding of 
      DSS and AT integration, providing insights for future developments and research 
      in the field of DSS for the care of PwD.
