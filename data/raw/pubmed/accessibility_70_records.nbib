TI  - IoT Wearable Sensors and Devices in Elderly Care: A Literature Review.
LID - 10.3390/s20102826 [doi]
LID - 2826
AB  - The increasing ageing global population is causing an upsurge in ailments related 
      to old age, primarily dementia and Alzheimer's disease, frailty, Parkinson's, and 
      cardiovascular disease, but also a general need for general eldercare as well as 
      active and healthy ageing. In turn, there is a need for constant monitoring and 
      assistance, intervention, and support, causing a considerable financial and human 
      burden on individuals and their caregivers. Interconnected sensing technology, 
      such as IoT wearables and devices, present a promising solution for objective, 
      reliable, and remote monitoring, assessment, and support through ambient assisted 
      living. This paper presents a review of such solutions including both earlier 
      review studies and individual case studies, rapidly evolving in the last decade. 
      In doing so, it examines and categorizes them according to common aspects of 
      interest such as health focus, from specific ailments to general eldercare; IoT 
      technologies, from wearables to smart home sensors; aims, from assessment to fall 
      detection and indoor positioning to intervention; and experimental evaluation 
      participants duration and outcome measures, from acceptability to accuracy. 
      Statistics drawn from this categorization aim to outline the current 
      state-of-the-art, as well as trends and effective practices for the future of 
      effective, accessible, and acceptable eldercare with technology.

AB  - Wearable sensors in healthcare monitoring have recently found widespread 
      applications in biomedical fields for their non- or minimal-invasive, 
      user-friendly and easy-accessible features. Sensing materials is one of the major 
      challenges to achieve these superiorities of wearable sensors for healthcare 
      monitoring, while graphene-based materials with many favorable properties have 
      shown great efficiency in sensing various biochemical and biophysical signals. In 
      this paper, we review state-of-the-art advances in the development and 
      modification of graphene-based materials (i.e., graphene, graphene oxide and 
      reduced graphene oxide) for fabricating advanced wearable sensors with 1D 
      (fibers), 2D (films) and 3D (foams/aerogels/hydrogels) macroscopic structures. We 
      summarize the structural design guidelines, sensing mechanisms, applications and 
      evolution of the graphene-based materials as wearable sensors for healthcare 
      monitoring of biophysical signals (e.g., mechanical, thermal and 
      electrophysiological signals) and biochemical signals from various body fluids 
      and exhaled gases. Finally, existing challenges and future prospects are 
      presented in this area.

LID - e12045
AB  - As a fundamental and ubiquitous body motion, respiration offers a large amount of 
      biomechanical energy with an average power up to the Watt level through movements 
      of multiple muscles. The energy from respiration featured with excellent 
      stability, accessibility and continuality inspires the design and engineering of 
      biomechanical energy harvesting devices, such as triboelectric nanogenerators 
      (TENGs), to realize human-powered electronics. This review article is thus 
      dedicated to the emerging respiration-driven TENG technology, covering 
      fundamentals, applications, and perspectives. Specifically, the human breathing 
      mechanics are first introduced serving as the base for the developments of TENG 
      devices with different configurations. Biomedical applications including 
      electrical energy generation, healthcare monitoring, air filtration, gas sensing, 
      electrostimulation, and powering implantable medical devices are then analyzed 
      focusing on the design-application relationships. At last, current developments 
      are summarized and critical challenges for driving these intriguing developments 
      toward practical applications are discussed together with promising solutions.

TI  - A Review of Skin-Wearable Sensors for Non-Invasive Health Monitoring 
      Applications.
LID - 10.3390/s23073673 [doi]
LID - 3673
AB  - The early detection of fatal diseases is crucial for medical diagnostics and 
      treatment, both of which benefit the individual and society. Portable devices, 
      such as thermometers and blood pressure monitors, and large instruments, such as 
      computed tomography (CT) and X-ray scanners, have already been implemented to 
      collect health-related information. However, collecting health information using 
      conventional medical equipment at home or in a hospital can be inefficient and 
      can potentially affect the timeliness of treatment. Therefore, on-time vital 
      signal collection via healthcare monitoring has received increasing attention. As 
      the largest organ of the human body, skin delivers significant signals reflecting 
      our health condition; thus, receiving vital signals directly from the skin offers 
      the opportunity for accessible and versatile non-invasive monitoring. In 
      particular, emerging flexible and stretchable electronics demonstrate the 
      capability of skin-like devices for on-time and continuous long-term health 
      monitoring. Compared to traditional electronic devices, this type of device has 
      better mechanical properties, such as skin conformal attachment, and maintains 
      compatible detectability. This review divides the health information that can be 
      obtained from skin using the sensor aspect's input energy forms into five 
      categories: thermoelectrical signals, neural electrical signals, photoelectrical 
      signals, electrochemical signals, and mechanical pressure signals. We then 
      summarize current skin-wearable health monitoring devices and provide outlooks on 
      future development.

AB  - Telemedicine and remote patient monitoring (RPM) systems have been gaining 
      interest and received adaptation in healthcare sectors since the COVID-19 
      pandemic due to their efficiency and capability to deliver timely healthcare 
      services while containing COVID-19 transmission. These systems were developed 
      using the latest technology in wireless sensors, medical devices, cloud 
      computing, mobile computing, telecommunications, and machine learning 
      technologies. In this article, a real-time remote patient monitoring system is 
      proposed with an accessible, compact, accurate, and low-cost design. The 
      implemented system is designed to an end-to-end communication interface between 
      medical practitioners and patients. The objective of this study is to provide 
      remote healthcare services to patients who need ongoing care or those who have 
      been discharged from the hospital without affecting their daily routines. The 
      developed monitoring system was then evaluated on 1177 records from MIMIC-III 
      clinical dataset (aged between 19 and 99 years). The performance analysis of the 
      proposed system achieved 88.7% accuracy in generating alerts with logistic 
      regression classification algorithm. This result reflects positively on the 
      quality and robustness of the proposed study. Since the processing time of the 
      proposed system is less than 2 minutes, it can be stated that the system has a 
      high computational speed and is convenient to use in real-time monitoring. 
      Furthermore, the proposed system will fulfil to cover the lower doctor-to-patient 
      ratio by monitoring patients from remote locations and aged people who reside in 
      their residences.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic and discovery of new mutant strains have a devastating 
      impact worldwide. Patients with severe COVID-19 require various equipment, such 
      as ventilators, infusion pumps, and patient monitors, and a dedicated medical 
      team to operate and monitor the equipment in isolated intensive care units 
      (ICUs). Medical staff must wear personal protective equipment to reduce the risk 
      of infection. This study proposes a tele-monitoring system for isolation ICUs to 
      assist in the monitoring of COVID-19 patients. The tele-monitoring system 
      consists of three parts: medical-device panel image processing, transmission, and 
      tele-monitoring. This system can monitor the ventilator screen with obstacles, 
      receive and store data, and provide real-time monitoring and data analysis. The 
      proposed tele-monitoring system is compared with previous studies, and the image 
      combination algorithm for reconstruction is evaluated using structural similarity 
      index (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). The system achieves an SSIM 
      score of 0.948 in the left side and a PSNR of 23.414 dB in the right side with no 
      obstacles. It also reduces blind spots, with an SSIM score of 0.901 and a PSNR 
      score of 18.13 dB. The proposed tele-monitoring system is compatible with both 
      wired and wireless communication, making it accessible in various situations. It 
      uses camera and performs live data monitoring, and the two monitoring systems 
      complement each other. The system also includes a comprehensive database and an 
      analysis tool, allowing medical staff to collect and analyze data on ventilator 
      use, providing them a quick, at-a-glance view of the patient's condition. With 
      the implementation of this system, patient outcomes may be improved and the 
      burden on medical professionals may be reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic-like 
      situations.

AB  - Telemedicine enables the remote provision of medical care through information and 
      communication technologies, facilitating data transmission, patient 
      participation, promotion of heart-healthy habits, diagnosis, early detection of 
      acute decompensation, and monitoring and follow-up of cardiovascular diseases. 
      Wearable devices have multiple clinical applications, ranging from arrhythmia 
      detection to remote monitoring of chronic diseases and risk factors. Integrating 
      these technologies safely and effectively into routine clinical practice will 
      require a multidisciplinary approach. Technological advances and data management 
      will increase telemonitoring strategies, which will allow greater accessibility 
      and equity, as well as more efficient and accurate patient care. However, there 
      are still unresolved issues, such as identifying the most appropriate 
      technological infrastructure, integrating these data into medical records, and 
      addressing the digital divide, which can hamper patients' adoption of remote 
      care. This article provides an updated overview of digital tools for a more 
      comprehensive approach to atrial fibrillation, heart failure, risk factors, and 
      treatment adherence.

TI  - Using Technology to Deliver Cardiovascular Care in African Countries.
PG  - 1823-1830
LID - 10.1007/s11886-023-01988-2 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review aims to explore the applications of digital 
      technology in cardiovascular care across African countries. It highlights the 
      opportunities and challenges associated with leveraging technology to enhance 
      patient self-monitoring, remote patient-clinician interactions, telemedicine, 
      clinician and patient education, and research facilitation. The purpose is to 
      highlight how technology can transform cardiovascular care in Africa. RECENT 
      FINDINGS: Recent findings indicate that the increasing penetration of mobile 
      phones and internet connectivity in Africa offers a unique opportunity to improve 
      cardiovascular care. Smartphone-based applications and text messaging services 
      have been employed to promote self-monitoring and lifestyle management, although 
      challenges related to smartphone ownership and digital literacy persist. Remote 
      monitoring of patients by clinicians using home-based devices and wearables shows 
      promise but requires greater accessibility and validation studies in African 
      populations. Telemedicine diagnosis and management of cardiovascular conditions 
      demonstrates significant potential but faces adoption challenges. Investing in 
      targeted clinician and patient education on novel digital technology and devices 
      as well as promoting technology-assisted research for participant recruitment and 
      data collection can facilitate cardiovascular care advancements in Africa. 
      Technology has the potential to revolutionize cardiovascular care in Africa by 
      improving access, efficiency, and patient outcomes. However, barriers related to 
      limited resources, supportive infrastructure, digital literacy, and access to 
      devices must be addressed. Strategic actions, including investment in digital 
      infrastructure, training programs, community collaboration, and policy advocacy, 
      are crucial to ensuring equitable integration of digital health solutions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) programs and people with CF (PwCF) employed 
      various monitoring methods for virtual care during the COVID-19 pandemic. This 
      paper characterizes experiences with remote monitoring across the U.S. CF 
      community. METHODS: The CF Foundation (CFF) sponsored distribution of home 
      spirometers (April 2020 to May 2021), surveys to PwCF and CF programs (July to 
      September 2020), and a second program survey (April to May 2021). We used mixed 
      methods to explore access, use, and perspectives regarding the use of remote 
      monitoring in future care. RESULTS: By October 2020, 13,345 spirometers had been 
      distributed, and 19,271 spirometers by May 2021. Programs (n=286) estimated 
      proportions of PwCF with home devices increased over seven months: spirometers 
      (30% to 70%), scales (50% to 70%), oximeters (5% to 10%) with higher estimates in 
      adult programs for spirometers and oximeters. PwCF (n=378) had access to scales 
      (89%), followed by oximeters (48%) and spirometers (47%), often using scales and 
      oximeters weekly, and spirometers monthly. Over both surveys, some programs had 
      no method to collect respiratory specimens for cultures associated with 
      telehealth visits (47%, n=132; 41%, n=118). Most programs (81%) had a process for 
      phlebotomy associated with a telehealth visit, primarily through off-site labs. 
      Both PwCF and programs felt future care should advance remote monitoring and 
      recommended improvements for access, training, and data collection systems. 
      CONCLUSIONS: PwCF and programs experienced unprecedented access to remote 
      monitoring and raised its importance for future care. Improvements to current 
      systems may leverage these shared experiences to augment future care models.

TI  - Virtual health care for children: Parental willingness to adopt virtual 
      health-care technologies.
PG  - 1323-1329
LID - 10.1111/jpc.15974 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To understand parental awareness and appetite for virtual health modalities, 
      including asynchronous communication and remote monitoring. To understand which 
      socio-demographic characteristics are associated with greater awareness and 
      appetite for virtual health. METHODS: Nationally representative survey of 
      Australian parents, recruited via an online panel in February 2021 as part of the 
      Royal Children's Hospital National Child Health Poll. Participants were randomly 
      selected from the consumer panel. RESULTS: 1981 (59.4% response rate) parents 
      completed the survey. 39.9% were aware of virtual health care, defined by digital 
      technology and medical devices to support remote monitoring. Higher levels of 
      awareness were associated with being male, having previous teleconsultation 
      experience, higher education attainment and employment. Most parents reported an 
      appetite for asynchronous communication using an app or website to either provide 
      information prior to a consult (65.9%), provide a photo of a rash or similar 
      (61.7%) or receive medical advice (58.1%). Appetite for wearable devices was 
      similar at 59.9%. CONCLUSIONS: Whilst awareness of virtual healthcare was low, 
      appetite exists amongst Australian parents to use technology to support their 
      child's health care. Health-care models, which incorporate asynchronous 
      communication or symptom monitoring through apps, are likely to be acceptable and 
      offer an accessible and sustainable alternative to traditional face-to-face 
      health care.

AB  - Healthcare studies are moving toward individualised measurement. There is need to 
      move beyond supervised assessments in the laboratory/clinic. Longitudinal 
      free-living assessment can provide a wealth of information on patient pathology 
      and habitual behaviour, but cost and complexity of equipment have typically been 
      a barrier. Lack of supervised conditions within free-living assessment means 
      there is need to augment these studies with environmental analysis to provide 
      context to individual measurements. This paper reviews low-cost and accessible 
      Internet of Things (IoT) technologies with the aim of informing biomedical 
      engineers of possibilities, workflows and limitations they present. In doing so, 
      we evidence their use within healthcare research through literature and 
      experimentation. As hardware becomes more affordable and feature rich, the cost 
      of data magnifies. This can be limiting for biomedical engineers exploring 
      low-cost solutions as data costs can make IoT approaches unscalable. IoT 
      technologies can be exploited by biomedical engineers, but more research is 
      needed before these technologies can become commonplace for clinicians and 
      healthcare practitioners. It is hoped that the insights provided by this paper 
      will better equip biomedical engineers to lead and monitor multi-disciplinary 
      research investigations.

AB  - PURPOSE: This article demonstrates the leadership role of the clinical nurse 
      specialist in developing and implementing healthcare technology across the 
      continuum of care. DESCRIPTION: Three virtual nursing practices-facilitated 
      self-care, remote patient monitoring, and virtual acute care nursing-illustrate 
      how the clinical nurse specialist is well suited to transform traditional 
      practice models to ones that use healthcare technology effectively. These 3 
      practices use interactive healthcare technology to gather patient data and allow 
      communication and coordination with the healthcare team to meet patient-specific 
      needs. OUTCOME: Use of healthcare technology in virtual nursing practices led to 
      early care team intervention, optimized care team processes, proactive patient 
      outreach, timely access to care, and reduction in healthcare-associated errors 
      and near-miss events. CONCLUSION: Clinical nurse specialists are well positioned 
      to develop innovative, effective, accessible, and high-quality virtual nursing 
      practices. Integrating healthcare technology with nursing practice augments care 
      for various patients, ranging from those with low illness severity in the 
      outpatient setting to acutely ill patients in the inpatient hospital environment.

      systems: a scoping review.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite all the excitement and hype generated regarding the expected 
      transformative impact of digital technology on the healthcare industry, 
      traditional healthcare systems around the world have largely remained unchanged 
      and resultant improvements in developed countries are slower than anticipated. 
      One area which was expected to significantly improve the quality of and access to 
      primary healthcare services in particular is remote patient monitoring and 
      management. Based on a combination of rapid advances in body sensors and 
      information and communication technologies (ICT), it was hoped that remote 
      patient management tools and systems (RPMTSs) would significantly reduce the care 
      burden on traditional healthcare systems as well as health-related costs. 
      However, the uptake or adoption of above systems has been extremely slow and 
      their roll out has not yet properly taken off especially in developing countries 
      where they ought to have made the greatest positive impact. AIM: The aim of the 
      study was to assess whether or not recent, relevant literature would support the 
      development of in-community, design, deployment and implementation framework 
      based on three factors thought to be important drivers and levers of RPMTS's 
      adoption and scalability. METHODS: A rapid, scoping review conducted on relevant 
      articles obtained from PubMed, MEDLINE, PMC and Cochrane databases and grey 
      literature on Google and published between 2012 and May 2020, by combining a 
      number of relevant search terms and phrases. RESULTS: Most RPMTSs are targeted at 
      and focused on a single disease, do not extensively involve patients and 
      clinicians in their early planning and design phases, are not designed to best 
      serve a specific catchment area and are mainly directed at post-hospital, disease 
      management settings. This may be leading to a situation where patients, potential 
      patients and clinicians simply do not make use of these tools, leading to low 
      adoption and scalability thereof. CONCLUSION: The development of a user-centred, 
      context-dependent, customizable design and deployment framework could potentially 
      increase the adoption and scalability of RPMTSs, if such framework addressed a 
      combination of diseases, prevalent in a given specific catchment area, especially 
      in developing countries with limited financial resources.

AB  - Electronic-based health care delivery systems are gaining popularity among 
      patients and clinicians because of convenience. Importantly, telemedicine, the 
      delivery of health care and/or health information using electronic systems, can 
      deliver primary and specialized health care to geographically isolated patients, 
      who account for nearly 20% of the US population. In nephrology, where a growing 
      discrepancy exists between the geographic location of nephrologists and patients 
      with kidney disease, telenephrology can bridge distance and deliver renal care 
      and education to the isolated. Large nationalized health care systems, for which 
      incentives are aligned to innovate and implement new platforms to deliver 
      cost-effective care, have been at the forefront of telenephrology. These systems 
      include synchronous direct physician-patient care through clinical 
      videoconferencing, and asynchronous modalities such as electronic consultation 
      and video telehealth to educate internists about specialized clinical topics. 
      Large health care organizations are adopting these platforms as standalone 
      services; however, expansion into the private health care system has been limited 
      by reimbursement, regulations, and other issues. Though telenephrology is patient 
      centered, studies are needed to rigorously test its clinical efficacy and 
      cost-effectiveness. Nonetheless, growing patient demand for patient-centric 
      health care will continue to expand the telenephrology space.

TI  - Association of Remote Technology Use and Other Decentralization Tools With 
      Patient Likelihood to Enroll in Cancer Clinical Trials.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Logistical challenges such as travel time and distance to a clinical 
      trial site can be a barrier to patient participation. The association of remote 
      technology use and other decentralization tools that can reduce these barriers 
      with likelihood to enroll in cancer trials is not well understood. OBJECTIVE: To 
      assess the association of remote technology and other decentralization tools used 
      to reduce participation-related time and travel with the likelihood to enroll in 
      cancer clinical trials. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Between July 6 and 
      September 8, 2021, a 41-question, cross-sectional, internet-based survey was 
      administered to patients with cancer and survivors of cancer in the US who had 
      been diagnosed with or treated for cancer in the past 7 years. MAIN OUTCOMES AND 
      MEASURES: Increase in self-reported likelihood to enroll in cancer clinical 
      trials that use remote technology and other decentralization tools to decrease 
      the need for travel to the trial site. RESULTS: There were 1183 survey 
      respondents, with a mean (SD) age of 58.2 (12.5) years. Respondents self-reported 
      their gender, race and ethnicity, cancer type, and treatment status. Of the 1183 
      respondents, 848 (72%) were female, 296 (25%) were male, 8 (1%) were 
      other/nonbinary, and 31 (3%) declined to answer. With regard to race, 28 
      respondents (3%) were American Indian or Alaska Native, 25 (2%) were Asian, 234 
      (20%) were Black or African American, 20 (2%) were Native Hawaiian or Other 
      Pacific Islander, 825 (70%) were White, and 51 (4%) declined to answer. With 
      regard to ethnicity, 115 respondents (10%) were Hispanic, Latino/Latina, or of 
      Spanish origin, whereas 1017 (86%) were not and 51 (4%) declined to answer. 
      Regarding cancer type and treatment status, 483 respondents (41%) either had or 
      had survived breast cancer and 325 (28%) were being treated for cancer during the 
      survey period. Individuals older than 55 years were more likely to say that they 
      would only participate in trials no farther from their home than their regular 
      care health care practitioner compared with younger respondents (26% vs 16%, 
      respectively; P = .02). Higher-income earners (ie, those in households earning 
      >$125 000/y) were significantly more likely than lower-income earners (ie, those 
      in households earning <$70 000/y) to say they would participate in trials 
      requiring additional effort (62% vs 41%, respectively; P = .03). If given the 
      opportunity to enroll in a cancer clinical trial that required travel farther 
      than their regular care, a majority of respondents (range, 60%-85%) indicated 
      that they would be more likely to participate if the trial used remote technology 
      and other tools to decrease the need for travel to a trial site. CONCLUSIONS AND 
      RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study, the survey findings suggest that cancer 
      clinical trials leveraging remote technology and decentralization tools to reduce 
      patient time and travel burden associated with participation may increase the 
      patient consent rate.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Physical disabilities become more common with advancing age. 
      Rehabilitation restores function, maintaining independence for longer. However, 
      the poor availability and accessibility of rehabilitation limits its clinical 
      impact. Artificial Intelligence (AI) guided interventions have improved many 
      domains of healthcare, but whether rehabilitation can benefit from AI remains 
      unclear. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of AI-supported physical 
      rehabilitation technology tested in the clinical setting to understand: 1) 
      availability of AI-supported physical rehabilitation technology; 2) its clinical 
      effect; 3) and the barriers and facilitators to implementation. We searched in 
      MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Science Citation Index (Web of Science), CIRRIE (now 
      NARIC), and OpenGrey. RESULTS: We identified 9054 articles and included 28 
      projects. AI solutions spanned five categories: App-based systems, robotic 
      devices that replace function, robotic devices that restore function, gaming 
      systems and wearables. We identified five randomised controlled trials (RCTs), 
      which evaluated outcomes relating to physical function, activity, pain, and 
      health-related quality of life. The clinical effects were inconsistent. 
      Implementation barriers included technology literacy, reliability, and user 
      fatigue. Enablers included greater access to rehabilitation programmes, remote 
      monitoring of progress, reduction in manpower requirements and lower cost. 
      CONCLUSION: Application of AI in physical rehabilitation is a growing field, but 
      clinical effects have yet to be studied rigorously. Developers must strive to 
      conduct robust clinical evaluations in the real-world setting and appraise post 
      implementation experiences.

TI  - Mobilemicroservices Architecture for Remote Monitoring of Patients: A Feasibility 
      Study.
PG  - 200-204
LID - 10.3233/SHTI220061 [doi]
AB  - Recent developments in smart mobile devices (SMDs), wearable sensors, the 
      Internet, mobile networks, and computing power provide new healthcare 
      opportunities that are not restricted geographically. This paper aims to 
      introduce Mobilemicroservices Architecture (MMA) based on a study on 
      architectures. In MMA, an HTTP-based Mobilemicroservivce (MM) is allocated to 
      each SMD's sensor. The key benefits are extendibility, scalability, ease of use 
      for the patient, security, and the possibility to collect raw data without the 
      necessity to involve cloud services. Feasibility was investigated in a two-year 
      project, where MMA-based solutions were used to collect motor function data from 
      patients with Parkinson's disease. First, we collected motor function data from 
      98 patients and healthy controls during their visit to a clinic. Second, we 
      monitored the same subjects in real-time for three days in their everyday living 
      environment. These MMA applications represent HTTP-based business-logic computing 
      in which the SMDs' resources are accessible globally.

      Barriers and facilitators.
PG  - 100188
LID - 10.1016/j.prdoa.2023.100188 [doi]
LID - 100188
AB  - BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease 
      with a fast increasing prevalence. Several pharmacological and 
      non-pharmacological interventions are available to alleviate symptoms. Technology 
      can be used to improve the efficiency, accessibility and feasibility of these 
      treatments. Although many technologies are available, only few are actually 
      implemented in daily clinical practice. AIM: Here, we study the barriers and 
      facilitators, as experienced by patients, caregivers and/or healthcare providers, 
      to successful implement technology for PD management. METHODS: We performed a 
      systematic literature search in the PubMed and Embase databases until June 2022. 
      Two independent raters screened the titles, abstracts and full texts on: 1) 
      people with PD; 2) using technology for disease management; 3) qualitative 
      research methods providing patients', caregivers and/or healthcare providers' 
      perspective, and; 4) full text available in English or Dutch. Case studies, 
      reviews and conference abstracts were excluded. RESULTS: We found 5420 unique 
      articles of which 34 were included in this study. Five categories were made: 
      cueing (n = 3), exergaming (n = 3), remote monitoring using wearable sensors 
      (n = 10), telerehabilitation (n = 8) and remote consultation (n = 10). The main 
      barriers reported across categories were unfamiliarity with technology, high 
      costs, technical issues and (motor) symptoms hampering the use of some 
      technologies. Facilitators included good usability, experiencing beneficial 
      effects and feeling safe whilst using the technology. CONCLUSION: Although only 
      few articles presented a qualitative evaluation of technologies, we found some 
      important barriers and facilitators that may help to bridge the gap between the 
      fast developing technological world and actual implementation in day-to-day 
      living with PD.

TI  - Advanced Home-Based Shoulder Rehabilitation: A Systematic Review of Remote 
      Monitoring Devices and Their Therapeutic Efficacy.
LID - 10.3390/s24092936 [doi]
LID - 2936
AB  - Shoulder pain represents the most frequently reported musculoskeletal disorder, 
      often leading to significant functional impairment and pain, impacting quality of 
      life. Home-based rehabilitation programs offer a more accessible and convenient 
      solution for an effective shoulder disorder treatment, addressing logistical and 
      financial constraints associated with traditional physiotherapy. The aim of this 
      systematic review is to report the monitoring devices currently proposed and 
      tested for shoulder rehabilitation in home settings. The research question was 
      formulated using the PICO approach, and the PRISMA guidelines were applied to 
      ensure a transparent methodology for the systematic review process. A 
      comprehensive search of PubMed and Scopus was conducted, and the results were 
      included from 2014 up to 2023. Three different tools (i.e., the Rob 2 version of 
      the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool, the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical 
      Appraisal tool, and the ROBINS-I tool) were used to assess the risk of bias. 
      Fifteen studies were included as they fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The 
      results showed that wearable systems represent a promising solution as remote 
      monitoring technologies, offering quantitative and clinically meaningful insights 
      into the progress of individuals within a rehabilitation pathway. Recent trends 
      indicate a growing use of low-cost, non-intrusive visual tracking devices, such 
      as camera-based monitoring systems, within the domain of tele-rehabilitation. The 
      integration of home-based monitoring devices alongside traditional rehabilitation 
      methods is acquiring significant attention, offering broader access to 
      high-quality care, and potentially reducing healthcare costs associated with 
      in-person therapy.

AB  - On account of privacy preserving issue and health-care monitoring, physiological 
      signal biometric authentication system has gained popularity in recent years. 
      Seismocardiogram (SCG) is now easily accessible owing to the advance of wearable 
      sensor technology. However, SCG biometric has not been widely explored due to the 
      challenging motion artifact removal. In this paper, we design placing the sensors 
      at different body parts under different activities to determine the best sensor 
      location. In addition, we develop SCG noise removal algorithm and utilize machine 
      learning approach to perform biometric authentication tasks. We validate the 
      proposed methods on 20 healthy young adults. The dataset contains acceleration 
      data of sitting, standing, walking, and sitting post-exercise activities with the 
      sensor placed at the wrists, neck, heart and sternum. We demonstrate that 
      vertical and dorsal-ventral SCG near the heart and the sternum produce reliable 
      SCG biometric evidenced by achieving the state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, 
      we present the efficacy of the devised noise removal procedure in the 
      authentication during walking motion.Clinical relevance- A 
      seismocardiography-based biometric authentication system can help serve privacy 
      preserving and reveal cardiovascular functioning information in clinics.

      dialysis.].
PG  - 404-410
LID - 10.1701/3407.33922 [doi]
AB  - Lockdown and self-isolation are to date the only solution to limit the spread of 
      recent outbreak of coronavirus disease (CoViD-19), highlighting the great 
      advantage of home dialysis in a patient otherwise forced to travel from / to the 
      dialysis center to receive this "life-saving" treatment. Indeed, to prevent 
      spreading of CoViD-19 infection among extremely fragile dialysis patients, as 
      well as among dialysis workers, hemodialysis (HD) centers are adopting specific 
      procedures ("dedicated" dialysis facilities, portable osmosis, etc.) with a great 
      economic and organizational commitment. Peritoneal dialysis (PD) represents a 
      type of home dialysis therapy not yet adequately implemented to date, in spite of 
      safe and simple practice, as well as similar dialytic efficiency vs in-center 
      hemodialysis. Remote patient monitoring (RPM) systems have been developed in 
      automated PD (APD) cyclers in order to improve the acceptance of this dialysis 
      method, to increase the compliance to the prescribed therapy and to control 
      treatment adequacy. In this review we assess the potential advantages of RPM in 
      APD, that are the chance for patients to acquire greater independence and safety 
      in the home treatment, to allow better access to care for residents in remote 
      areas, faster resolution of problems, reduction in hospitalizations and mortality 
      rates, as well as time and cost saving for both the patient and the staff. The 
      use of medical devices (sphygmomanometer, glucometer, balance, etc.), connected 
      by wireless to the clinician's portal, might also allow a wider diffusion of 
      incremental dialysis, an integrated therapy that combines conservative management 
      of ESKD patients with a soft dialysis based on the residual kidney function and 
      symptomatology, with potential prognosis and economic benefits. Although the 
      majority of the studies are small and observational, a wider use of RPM systems 
      is desirable to broaden the spread of home dialysis, as we learnt from 
      Coronavirus pandemic.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an increasingly prevalent chronic, 
      autoimmune, and inflammatory central nervous system illness, whose common 
      symptoms undermine the quality of life of patients and their families. Recent 
      technical breakthroughs potentially offer continuous, reliable, sensitive, and 
      objective remote monitoring solutions for healthcare. Wearables can be useful for 
      evaluating falls, fatigue, sedentary behavior, exercise, and sleep quality in 
      people with MS (PwMS). OBJECTIVE: This scoping review of relevant literature 
      explores studies investigating the perceptions of patients and healthcare 
      professionals (HCPs) about the use of wearable technologies in the management of 
      MS. METHODS: The Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for scoping reviews was 
      used. The search strategy was applied to the databases, MEDLINE via Ovid, Embase, 
      APA PsycInfo, and CINAHL. Further searches were performed in IEEE, Scopus, and 
      Web of Science. The review considered studies reporting quantitative or 
      qualitative data on perceptions and experiences of PwMS and HCPs concerning 
      wearables' usability, satisfaction, barriers, and facilitators. RESULTS: 10 
      studies were included in this review. Wearables' usefulness and accessibility, 
      ease of use, awareness, and motivational tool potential were patient-perceived 
      facilitators of use. Barriers related to anxiety and frustration, complexity, and 
      the design of wearables. Perceived usefulness and system requirements are 
      identified as facilitators of using wearables by HCPs, while data security 
      concerns and fears of increased workload and limited effectiveness in the care 
      plan are identified as barriers to use wearables. CONCLUSIONS: This review 
      contributes to our understanding of the benefits of wearable technologies in MS 
      by exploring perceptions of both PwMS and HCPs. The scoping review provided a 
      broad overview of facilitators and barriers to wearable use in MS. There is a 
      need for further studies underlined with sound theoretical frameworks to provide 
      a robust evidence-base for the optimal use of wearables to empower healthcare 
      users and providers.

TI  - Mobile and Computer-Based Applications for Rehabilitation Monitoring and 
      Self-Management After Knee Arthroplasty: Scoping Review.
PG  - e47843
LID - 10.2196/47843 [doi]
LID - e47843
AB  - BACKGROUND: Successful post-knee replacement rehabilitation requires adequate 
      access to health information, social support, and periodic monitoring by a health 
      professional. Mobile health (mHealth) and computer-based technologies are used 
      for rehabilitation and remote monitoring. The extent of technology use and its 
      function in post-knee replacement rehabilitation care in low and middle-income 
      settings are unknown. OBJECTIVE: To inform future mHealth intervention 
      development, we conducted a scoping review to map the features and functionality 
      of existing technologies and determine users' perspectives on telerehabilitation 
      and technology for self-management. METHODS: We followed the Joanna Briggs 
      Institute methodology for scoping reviews. We searched the Embase, Medline, 
      PsycINFO via OVID, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases 
      for manuscripts published from 2001 onward. We included original research 
      articles reporting the use of mobile or computer-based technologies by patients, 
      health care providers, researchers, or family members. Studies were divided into 
      the following 3 categories based on the purpose: validation studies, clinical 
      evaluation, and end user feedback. We extracted general information on study 
      design, technology features, proposed function, and perspectives of health care 
      providers and patients. The protocol for this review is accessible in the Open 
      Science Framework. RESULTS: Of the 5960 articles, 158 that reported from 
      high-income settings contributed to the qualitative summary (64 studies on 
      mHealth or telerehabilitation programs, 28 validation studies, 38 studies 
      describing users' perceptions). The highest numbers of studies were from Europe 
      or the United Kingdom and North America regarding the use of a mobile app with or 
      without wearables and reported mainly in the last decade. No studies were from 
      low and middle-income settings. The primary functions of technology for remote 
      rehabilitation were education to aid recovery and enable regular, appropriate 
      exercises; monitoring progress of pain (n=19), activity (n=20), and exercise 
      adherence (n=30); 1 or 2-way communication with health care professionals to 
      facilitate the continuum of care (n=51); and goal setting (n=23). Assessment of 
      range of motion (n=16) and gait analysis (n=10) were the commonly validated 
      technologies developed to incorporate into a future rehabilitation program. Few 
      studies (n=14) reported end user involvement during the development stage. We 
      summarized the reasons for satisfaction and dissatisfaction among users across 
      various technologies. CONCLUSIONS: Several existing mobile and computer-based 
      technologies facilitate post-knee replacement rehabilitation care for patients 
      and health care providers. However, they are limited to high-income settings and 
      may not be extrapolated to low-income settings. A systematic needs assessment of 
      patients undergoing knee replacement and health care providers involved in

TI  - Advancing Dermatological Care: A Comprehensive Narrative Review of 
      Tele-Dermatology and mHealth for Bridging Gaps and Expanding Opportunities beyond 
      the COVID-19 Pandemic.
LID - 10.3390/healthcare11131911 [doi]
LID - 1911
AB  - Mobile health (mHealth) has recently had significant advances in tele-dermatology 
      (TD) thanks to the developments following the COVID-19 pandemic. This topic is 
      very important, as telemedicine and mHealth, when applied to dermatology, could 
      improve both the quality of healthcare for citizens and the workflow in the 
      health domain. The proposed study was centered on the last three years. We 
      conducted an overview on the opportunities, the perspectives, and the problems 
      involved in TD integration with mHealth. The methodology of the narrative review 
      was based on: (I) a search of PubMed and Scopus and (II) an eligibility 
      assessment, using properly proposed parameters. The outcome of the study showed 
      that during the COVID-19 pandemic, TD integration with mHealth advanced rapidly. 
      This integration enabled the monitoring of dermatological problems and 
      facilitated remote specialist visits, reducing face-to-face interactions. AI and 
      mobile apps have empowered citizens to take an active role in their healthcare. 
      This differs from other imaging sectors where information exchange is limited to 
      professionals. The opportunities for TD in mHealth include improving service 
      quality, streamlining healthcare processes, reducing costs, and providing more 
      accessible care. It can be applied to various conditions, such as (but not 
      limited to) acne, vitiligo, psoriasis, and skin cancers. Integration with AI and 
      augmented reality (AR), as well as the use of wearable sensors, are anticipated 
      as future developments. However, integrating TD with mHealth also brings about 
      problems and challenges related to regulations, ethics, cybersecurity, data 
      privacy, and device management. Scholars and policymakers need to address these 
      issues while involving citizens in the process.

TI  - Remote Monitoring Telemedicine (REMOTE) Platform for Patients With Anxiety 
      Symptoms and Alcohol Use Disorder: Protocol for a Case-Control Study.
PG  - e16964

AB  - BACKGROUND: Monitoring mental health outcomes has traditionally been based on 
      heuristic decisions, often based on scarce, subjective evidence, making the 
      clinical decisions made by professionals, as well as the monitoring of these 
      diseases, subject to flaws. However, the digital phenotype, which refers to the 
      analysis of data collected by measuring human behavior with mobile sensors and 
      smart bracelets, is a promising tool for filling this gap in current clinical 
      practice. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study are to develop the digital 
      phenotyping of patients with alcohol use disorder and anxiety symptoms using data 
      collected from a mobile device (ie, smartphone) and a wearable sensor (ie, 
      Fitbit) and to analyze usability and patient satisfaction with the data 
      collection service provided by the app. METHODS: We propose to conduct a study 
      among a group of 60 participants split into two subgroups-experimental and 
      control-of 30 participants each. The experimental group will be recruited by 
      physicians from the Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, and the control group will be 
      recruited on a volunteer basis through fliers and social media. All participants 
      will go through pretraining to ensure technological capability and understanding 
      of tasks, then each participant will download the HumanITcare app and will be 
      given a wearable sensor (ie, Fitbit). Throughout the 4-month period, participants 
      will be monitored on a range of factors, including sleep cycle, heart rate, 
      movement patterns, and sociability. All data from the wearable sensors and the 
      mobile devices will be saved and sent to the HumanITcare server. Participants 
      will be asked to complete weekly questionnaires about anxiety, depression, and 
      alcohol use disorder symptoms. Research assistants will ensure timely responses. 
      The data from both sensors will then be compared to the questionnaire responses 
      to determine how accurately the devices can predict the same symptoms. RESULTS: 
      The recruitment phase was completed in November 2019 and all the data were 
      collected by the end of December 2019. Data are being processed; this process is 
      expected to be completed by October 2020. CONCLUSIONS: This study was created and 
      conducted as a pilot study with the Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, with the 
      purpose of exploring the feasibility of our approach. The study is focused on 
      patients diagnosed with anxiety and alcohol use disorder, but participants were 
      also monitored for depressive symptoms throughout the trial, although these were 
      not part of the initial inclusion criteria. A limitation to our study was the 
      exclusive use of Android smartphones over iOS devices; this could result in a 
      potential selection bias, due to the accessibility and affordability of Android 
      phones as opposed to iOS-based phones. Another limitation might be that reviews 
      of usability and satisfaction could be confounded by factors such as age and 
      familiarity. An additional function that we might add in future studies is the 
      ability for patients to manage their own data. INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT

TI  - A Home Telemedicine System for Continuous Respiratory Monitoring.
PG  - 1247-1256
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2020.3012621 [doi]
AB  - This article presents a continuous home telemonitoring system for chronic 
      respiratory patients using 5G connectivity developed in partnership with Vodafone 
      as a part of the 5G Trial in Milan established by the Italian Ministry of 
      Economic Development. The system features a wearable respiratory and activity 
      monitor, an environmental sensor and a pulse oximeter sending the data through a 
      5G router to a Multi-Edge Computing server, incorporated in the Vodafone 5G 
      infrastructure, where they are stored and accessible for visualization. In 
      particular, activity, respiratory and environmental data are continuously 
      streamed and collected. The solution has been tested on 18 healthy volunteers 
      during non-supervised recordings lasting at least 48 hours. The combination of 
      recognized activities and associated respiratory parameters provided 
      statistically significant variations in breathing patterns between one activity 
      and the other, thus giving more complete information to the clinicians than 
      previously studied telemedicine systems based on spot-checks. In particular, 
      statistically significant differences are found in tidal volume and minute 
      ventilation between horizontal and vertical postures (p < 0.001) and between 
      vertical postures and dynamic activities (p < 0.001); the respiratory rate shows 
      statistically significant differences between horizontal and vertical postures (p 
      < 0.001). Some environmental parameters have different mean values between day 
      and night, such as carbon dioxide (p < 0.001). Trials on patients are needed to 
      further study this telemedicine solution and make it commercially available in 
      the future. The main further technical development suggested is the use of 
      commercial 5G smartphones as routers, in order to make the system usable outside 
      of home settings.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Patient initiated, remote cardiac monitoring has proved to be a 
      significant advance in the diagnosis and management of arrhythmias. Further 
      improvements in ease of use and access to results will further improve health 
      outcomes and cost-effectiveness. Here we describe a proof-of-concept evaluation 
      to assess the feasibility of successfully implementing a cloud-based management 
      system using KardiaPro (KP) for remote electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring to 
      interface into EPIC, an enterprise electronic health record (EHR) system. 
      METHODS: The KP management system was embedded using hypertext markup language 
      (HTML) code directly into the EHR. Encrypted credentials and patient data were 
      bundled with an application programming interface key allowing linkage of remote 
      monitoring from patients' smartphones. During the time of implementation, a total 
      of 322 patients and 32 179 ECGs were recorded. RESULTS: The KP-EHR interface 
      provided full functionality, allowing detection, interpretation and documentation 
      of atrial fibrillation (AF), flutter events, ventricular tachycardia, and 
      complete heart block. Our study focused on KP's detection of AF, and 16.7% of 
      tracings were classified as probable AF with only 2.3% of tracings not analyzed 
      by the KP algorithm because of tracings that were too noisy or truncated. 
      Enhanced management was facilitated with clinical information immediately 
      accessible. Blinded physician ECG review validated the KP proprietary algorithm 
      interpretation and ECGs. CONCLUSIONS: Direct integration of KP into EHR was 
      successful and practical. It allows for historical, point of care and immediate 
      retrieval of remote ambulatory monitoring data and documentation into the 
      electronic health record. KP EHR integration warrants further study as it has the 
      potential to improve cost-effectiveness and clinical diagnostic value, leading to 
      improvements in delivery of patient care.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the vulnerabilities of global health care systems, 
      underscoring the need for innovative solutions to meet the demands of an aging 
      population, workforce shortages, and rising physician burnout. In recent years, 
      wearable technology has helped segue various medical specialties into the digital 
      era, yet its adoption in vascular surgery remains limited. This article explores 
      the applications of wearable devices in vascular surgery and explores their 
      potential outlets, such as enhancing primary and secondary prevention, optimizing 
      perioperative care, and supporting surgical training. The integration of 
      artificial intelligence and machine learning with wearable technology further 
      expands its applications, enabling predictive analytics, personalized care, and 
      remote monitoring. Despite the promising prospects, challenges such as regulatory 
      complexities, data security, and interoperability must be addressed. As the 
      digital health movement unfolds, wearable technology could play a pivotal role in 
      reshaping vascular surgery while offering cost-effective, accessible, and 
      patient-centered care.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) technologies have been applied to various fields such as 
      manufacturing, automobile industry and healthcare. IoT-based healthcare has a 
      significant impact on real-time remote monitoring of patients' health and 
      consequently improving treatments and reducing healthcare costs. In fact, IoT has 
      made healthcare more reliable, efficient, and accessible. Two major drawbacks 
      which IoT suffers from can be expressed as: first, thelimited battery capacityof 
      thesensorsis quickly depleted due to the continuous stream of data; second, the 
      dependence of the system on the cloud for computations and processing causes 
      latency in data transmission which is not accepted in real-time monitoring 
      applications. This research is conducted to develop a real-time, secure, and 
      energy-efficient platform which provides a solution for reducing computation load 
      on the cloud and diminishing data transmission delay. In the proposed platform, 
      the sensors utilize a state-of-the-art power saving technique known as 
      Compressive Sensing (CS). CS allows sensors to retrieve the sensed data using 
      fewer measurements by sending a compressed signal. In this framework, the signal 
      reconstruction and processing are computed locally on a Heterogeneous Multicore 
      Platform (HMP) device to decrease the dependency on the cloud. In addition, a 
      framework has been implemented to control the system, set different parameters, 
      display the data as well as send live notifications to medical experts through 
      the cloud in order to alert them of any eventual hazardous event or abnormality 
      and allow quick interventions. Finally, a case study of the system is presented 
      demonstrating the acquisition and monitoring of the data for a given subject in 
      real-time. The obtained results reveal that the proposed solution reduces 15.4% 
      of energy consumption in sensors, that makes this prototype a good candidate for 
      IoT employment in healthcare.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Remote monitoring (RM) of cardiac implantable electronic devices 
      (CIED) allows rapid detection of clinical and electrical events. Recently, 
      several smartphone applications have been developed with the aim of improving 
      patient compliance and better interpreting and integrating data deriving from 
      remote control for the management of heart failure (HF). AREAS COVERED: Studies 
      investigating the role of CIEDs' RM in HF patients to predict and early treat 
      acute decompensation. The importance of new technologies and applications 
      developed to provide crucial information to clinicians, to better manage HF 
      patients. EXPERT OPINION: New medical technologies and smartphone applications 
      for CIEDs' RM were developed to help clinicians in the management of CIED 
      carriers. Indeed, the accessibility of technological devices (e.g. smartphones) 
      and the improvements in medical technology provide the opportunity to optimize HF 
      patients' monitoring by the transmission of device-related data, and with direct 
      involvement of patients themselves. Thanks to these advancements, physicians have 
      the possibility to recognize worsening signs of HF and promptly optimize 
      treatments to potentially avoid hospitalization. The great value of this approach 
      is its potential of reducing scheduled in-office visits or unnecessary medical 
      contacts and optimizing healthcare resources management.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with colorectal cancer who undergo surgery face many 
      postoperative problems. These problems include the risk of relapse, side effects, 
      and long-term complications. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to design and develop a 
      remote monitoring system as a technological solution for the postdischarge care 
      of these patients. METHODS: This research was conducted in 3 main steps: system 
      feature extraction, system design, and evaluation. After feature extraction from 
      a systematic review, the necessary features were defined by 18 clinical experts 
      in Iran. In the next step, the architecture of the system was designed based on 
      the requirements; the software and hardware parts of the system were embedded in 
      the architecture, then the software system components were drawn using the 
      unified modeling language diagrams, and the details of software system 
      implementation were identified. Regarding the hardware design, different 
      accessible hardware modules were evaluated, and suitable ones were selected. 
      Finally, the usability of the system was evaluated by demonstrating it over a 
      Skype virtual meeting session and using Nilsen's usability principles. RESULTS: A 
      total of 21 mandatory features in 5 main categories, including patient 
      information registration, periodic monitoring of health parameters, education, 
      reminders, and assessments, were defined and validated for the system. The 
      software was developed using an ASP.Net core backend, a Microsoft SQL Server 
      database, and an Ionic frontend alongside the Angular framework, to build an 
      Android app. The user roles of the system included 3 roles: physicians, patients, 
      and the system administrator. The hardware was designed to contain an Esp8266 as 
      the Internet of Things module, an MLX90614 infrared temperature sensor, and the 
      Maxim Integrated MAX30101 sensor for sensing the heartbeat. The hardware was 
      designed in the shape of a wristband device using SolidWorks 2020 and printed 
      using a 3D printer. The firmware of the hardware was developed in Arduino with 
      the capability of firmware over the air. In evaluating the software system from 
      the perspective of usability, the system received an average score of 3.8 out of 
      5 from 4 evaluators. CONCLUSIONS: Sensor-based telemonitoring systems for 
      patients with colorectal cancer after surgery are possible solutions that can 
      make the process automatic for patients and caregivers. The apps for remote 
      colorectal patient monitoring could be designed to be useful; however, more 
      research regarding the developed system's implementation in clinic settings and 
      hospitals is required to understand the probable barriers and limitations.

TI  - DoMoMEA: a Home-Based Telerehabilitation System for Stroke Patients.
PG  - 5773-5776
LID - 10.1109/EMBC44109.2020.9175742 [doi]
AB  - After a cerebral stroke, survivors need to follow a neurorehabilitation program 
      including exercises to be executed under a therapist's supervision or 
      autonomously. Technological solutions are needed to support the early discharge 
      of the patients just after the primary hospital treatments, by still providing an 
      adequate level of rehabilitation. The DoMoMEA Project proposes a fully-wearable 
      m-health solution able to administer a neurorehabilitation therapy in the 
      patient's home or every other place established by the patient for a 
      rehabilitation session. The exploitation of magneto-inertial measurement units 
      only, wirelessly connected to an Android-operated device, provides robustness to 
      different operating conditions and immunity to optical occlusion problems, 
      compared to RGB-D cameras. Patients' engagement is fostered by the exploitation 
      of the exergame version of the ten rehabilitation exercises, implemented in Unity 
      3D. Store-and-forward telemonitoring features, supported by cloud-based storage 
      and by a web application accessible from anywhere by medical personnel and 
      patients, enable constant transparent monitoring of the rehabilitation 
      progresses. The clinical trial of the DoMoMEA telerehabilitation system will 
      involve 40 post-stroke patients with mild impairment and will start as soon as 
      the restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic will allow to enroll patients.

TI  - Wearable Motion Sensor Device to Facilitate Rehabilitation in Patients With 
      Shoulder Adhesive Capsulitis: Pilot Study to Assess Feasibility.
PG  - e17032
LID - 10.2196/17032 [doi]
LID - e17032
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adhesive capsulitis (AC) of the shoulder is a common disorder that 
      painfully reduces the shoulder range of motion (ROM) among middle-aged 
      individuals. Although physical therapy with home-based exercises is widely 
      advised to restore ROM in the treatment of AC, clinical results vary owing to 
      inconsistent patient compliance. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to verify the 
      feasibility of a treatment model that involves applying a wearable motion sensor 
      device to assist patients conduct home-based exercises to improve training 
      compliance and the accuracy of exercises, with the ultimate goal of improving the 
      functional recovery of patients with AC. METHODS: The motion sensor device was 
      comprised of inertial measurement unit-based sensors and mobile apps for patients 
      and physicians, offering shoulder mobility tracing, home-based exercise support, 
      and progress monitoring. The interrater reliability of shoulder mobility 
      measurement using the motion sensor device on 10 healthy participants and 15 
      patients with AC was obtained using an intraclass correlation coefficient 
      analysis and compared with the assessments performed by two highly experienced 
      physicians. A pilot prospective control trial was then carried out to allocate 
      the 15 patients with AC to two groups: home-based exercise group and motion 
      sensor-assisted rehabilitation group. Changes in active and passive shoulder ROM, 
      pain and functional scores, and exercise completion rates were compared between 
      the groups during a treatment period of 3 months. RESULTS: Shoulder ROM, as 
      measured using the motion sensor device, exhibited good to excellent reliability 
      based on the comparison with the measurements of two physicians (intraclass 
      correlation coefficient range, 0.771 to 0.979). Compared with patients with AC in 
      the home-based exercise group, those in the motion sensor-assisted rehabilitation 
      group exhibited better shoulder mobility and functional recovery and a higher 
      exercise completion rate during and after 3 months of rehabilitation. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Motion sensor device-assisted home-based rehabilitation for the 
      treatment of AC is a useful treatment model for telerehabilitation that enhances 
      the compliance of patients through training, thus improving functional recovery. 
      This helps overcome important obstacles in physiotherapy at home by providing 
      comprehensible and easily accessible exercise instructions, enhancing compliance, 
      ensuring the correctness of exercise, and monitoring the progress of patients.

AB  - Since its introduction in 2014, laser-induced graphene (LIG) from commercial 
      polymers has been gaining interests in both academic and industrial sectors. This 
      can be clearly seen from its mass adoption in various fields ranging from energy 
      storage and sensing platforms to biomedical applications. LIG is a 3-dimensional, 
      nanoporous graphene structure with highly tuneable electrical, physical, and 
      chemical properties. LIG can be easily produced by single-step laser scribing at 
      normal room temperature and pressure using easily accessible commercial level 
      laser machines and materials. With the increasing demand for novel wearable 
      devices for biomedical applications, LIG on flexible substrates can readily serve 
      as a technological platform to be further developed for biomedical applications 
      such as point-of-care (POC) testing and wearable devices for healthcare 
      monitoring system. This review will provide a comprehensive grounding on LIG from 
      its inception and fabrication mechanism to the characterization of its key 
      functional properties. The exploration of biomedicals applications in the form of 
      wearable and point-of-care devices will then be presented. Issue of health risk 
      from accidental exposure to LIG will be covered. Then LIG-based wearable devices 
      will be compared to devices of different materials. Finally, we discuss the 
      implementation of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) to wearable devices and 
      explore and speculate on its potentials and challenges.

TI  - An Ex Vivo Study of Wireless Linkage Distance between Implantable LC Resonance 
      Sensor and External Readout Coil.
LID - 10.3390/s22218402 [doi]
LID - 8402
AB  - The wireless monitoring of key physiological parameters such as heart rate, 
      respiratory rate, temperature, and pressure can aid in preventive healthcare, 
      early diagnosis, and patient-tailored treatment. In wireless implantable sensors, 
      the distance between the sensor and the reader device is prone to be influenced 
      by the operating frequency, as well as by the medium between the sensor and the 
      reader. This manuscript presents an ex vivo investigation of the wireless linkage 
      between an implantable sensor and an external reader for medical applications. 
      The sensor was designed and fabricated using a cost-effective and accessible 
      fabrication process. The sensor is composed of a circular planar inductor (L) and 
      a circular planar capacitor (C) to form an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonance tank 
      circuit. The reader system comprises a readout coil and data acquisition 
      instrumentation. To investigate the effect of biological medium on wireless 
      linkage, the readout distance between the sensor and the readout coil was 
      examined independently for porcine and ovine tissues. In the bench model, to 
      mimic the bio-environment for the investigation, skin, muscle, and fat tissues 
      were used. The relative magnitude of the reflection coefficient (S11) at the 
      readout coil was used as a metric to benchmark wireless linkage. A readable 
      linkage signal was observed on the readout coil when the sensor was held up to 
      2.5 cm under layers of skin, muscle, and fat tissue. To increase the remote 
      readout distance of the LC sensor, the effect of the repeater coil was also 
      investigated. The experimental results showed that the magnitude of the 
      reflection coefficient signal was increased 3-3.5 times in the presence of the 
      repeater coil, thereby increasing the signal-to-noise ratio of the detected 
      signal. Therefore, the repeater coil between the sensor and the readout coil 
      allows a larger sensing range for a variety of applications in implanted or 
      sealed fields.

TI  - Design and Usability Assessment of a Multi-Device SOA-Based Telecare Framework 
      for the Elderly.
PG  - 268-279
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2019.2894552 [doi]
AB  - Telemonitoring is a branch of telehealth that aims at remotely monitoring vital 
      signs, which is important for chronically ill patients and the elderly living 
      alone. The available standalone devices and applications for the self-monitoring 
      of health parameters largely suffer from interoperability problems; meanwhile, 
      telemonitoring medical devices are expensive, self-contained, and are not 
      integrated into user-friendly technological platforms for the end user. This 
      paper presents the technical aspects and usability assessment of the 
      telemonitoring features of the HEREiAM platform, which supports heterogeneous 
      information technology systems. By exploiting a service-oriented architecture, 
      the measured parameters collected by off-the-shelf Bluetooth medical devices are 
      sent as XML documents to a private cloud that implements an interoperable health 
      service infrastructure, which is compliant with the most recent healthcare 
      standards and security protocols. This Android-based system is designed to be 
      accessible both via TV and portable devices, and includes other utilities 
      designed to support the elderly living alone. Four usability assessment sessions 
      with quality-validated questionnaires were performed to accurately understand the 
      ease of use, usefulness, acceptance, and quality of the proposed system. The 
      results reveal that our system achieved very high usability scores even at its 
      first use, and the scores did not significantly change over time during a field 
      trial that lasted for four months, reinforcing the idea of an intuitive design. 
      At the end of such a trial, the user-experience questionnaire achieved excellent 
      scores in all aspects with respect to the benchmark. Good results were also 
      reported by general practitioners who assessed the quality of their remote 
      interfaces for telemonitoring.

LID - 10.3390/s24020351 [doi]
LID - 351
AB  - Telemonitoring and telerehabilitation have shown promise in delivering 
      individualized healthcare remotely. We introduce STASISM, a sensor-based 
      telerehabilitation and telemonitoring system, in this work. This platform has 
      been created to facilitate individualized telerehabilitation and telemonitoring 
      for those who need rehabilitation or ongoing monitoring. To gather and analyze 
      pertinent and validated physiological, kinematic, and environmental data, the 
      system combines a variety of sensors and data analytic methodologies. The 
      platform facilitates customized rehabilitation activities based on individual 
      needs, allows for the remote monitoring of a patient's progress, and offers 
      real-time feedback. To protect the security of patient data and to safeguard 
      patient privacy, STASISM also provides secure data transmission and storage. The 
      platform has the potential to significantly improve the accessibility and 
      efficacy of telerehabilitation and telemonitoring programs, enhancing patients' 
      quality of life and allowing healthcare professionals to provide individualized 
      care outside of traditional clinical settings.

TI  - Recent advances in graphene-based electroanalytical devices for healthcare 
      applications.
PG  - 12857-12882
LID - 10.1039/d3nr06137j [doi]
AB  - Graphene, with its outstanding mechanical, electrical, and biocompatible 
      properties, stands out as an emerging nanomaterial for healthcare applications, 
      especially in building electroanalytical biodevices. With the rising prevalence 
      of chronic diseases and infectious diseases, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the 
      demand for point-of-care testing and remote patient monitoring has never been 
      greater. Owing to their portability, ease of manufacturing, scalability, and 
      rapid and sensitive response, electroanalytical devices excel in these settings 
      for improved healthcare accessibility, especially in resource-limited settings. 
      The development of different synthesis methods yielding large-scale graphene and 
      its derivatives with controllable properties, compatible with device 
      manufacturing - from lithography to various printing methods - and tunable 
      electrical, chemical, and electrochemical properties make it an attractive 
      candidate for electroanalytical devices. This review article sheds light on how 
      graphene-based devices can be transformative in addressing pressing healthcare 
      needs, ranging from the fundamental understanding of biology in in vivo and ex 
      vivo studies to early disease detection and management using in vitro assays and 
      wearable devices. In particular, the article provides a special focus on (i) 
      synthesis and functionalization techniques, emphasizing their suitability for 
      scalable integration into devices, (ii) various transduction methods to design 
      diverse electroanalytical device architectures, (iii) a myriad of applications 
      using devices based on graphene, its derivatives, and hybrids with other 
      nanomaterials, and (iv) emerging technologies at the intersection of device 
      engineering and advanced data analytics. Finally, some of the major hurdles that 
      graphene biodevices face for translation into clinical applications are 
      discussed.

TI  - Evolution of Diagnostic Methods for Helicobacter pylori Infections: From 
      Traditional Tests to High Technology, Advanced Sensitivity and Discrimination 
      Tools.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics12020508 [doi]
LID - 508
AB  - Rapid diagnosis and treatment application in the early stages of H. pylori 
      infection plays an important part in inhibiting the transmission of this 
      infection as this bacterium is involved in various gastric pathologies such as 
      gastritis, gastro-duodenal ulcer, and even gastric neoplasia. This review is 
      devoted to a quick overview of conventional and advanced detection techniques 
      successfully applied to the detection of H. pylori in the context of a compelling 
      need to upgrade the standards of the diagnostic methods which are currently being 
      used. Selecting the best diagnostic method implies evaluating different features, 
      the use of one or another test depending on accessibility, laboratories 
      equipment, and the clinical conditions of patients. This paper aims to expose the 
      diagnosis methods for H. pylori that are currently available, highlighting their 
      assets and limitations. The perspectives and the advantages of nanotechnology 
      along with the concept of nano(bio)sensors and the development of lab-on-chip 
      devices as advanced tools for H. pylori detection, differentiation, and 
      discrimination is also presented, by emphasizing multiple advantages: simple, 
      fast, cost-effective, portable, miniaturized, small volume of samples required, 
      highly sensitive, and selective. It is generally accepted that the development of 
      intelligent sensors will completely revolutionize the acquisition procedure and 
      medical decision in the framework of smart healthcare monitoring systems.

TI  - Mapping and analyzing the application of digital health for stroke 
      rehabilitation: scientometric analysis.
PG  - 1-10
LID - 10.1080/17483107.2024.2387101 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: A modern and accessible healthcare system requires digital 
      innovation and connectivity. The term "Digital health" covers vide range 
      technologies, such as mobile health and applications, electronic records, 
      telehealth and telemedicine, wearable devices, robotics, virtual reality and 
      artificial intelligence. METHODS: Scientometrics is the method that we have done 
      in this study by Cite Space and VOSviewer software, and the result of searching 
      the Web of Science database in plain text format to perform analysis and 
      scientometrics and create outputs in the form of graphs and tables in the field 
      of digital health has been used in stroke rehabilitation. RESULT: A total of 2933 
      documents related to digital health technologies in stroke rehabilitation were 
      identified by searching for the terms "stroke rehabilitation" or "stroke 
      recovery" in the title and "digital health" across all fields. The strongest 
      citations related to cerebrovascular disease spanned from 1994 to 2007, with 
      randomised clinical trials occurring almost simultaneously and ended by 2012. 
      Consequently, stroke rehabilitation by virtual reality technology has obtained 
      the most citations and clinical trials and as an important part of digital health 
      in the future research process. CONCLUSION: This scientometric study offers 
      insights into how digital health technology can assist stroke patients in 
      self-managing their health and well-being, in addition to supporting integrated 
      stroke rehabilitation. The analysis revealed that three themes were present: 
      author contributors and collaboration networks, temporal evolution, the strongest 
      citation explosions for digital health technologies in stroke rehabilitation 
      research, and semantic analysis.

OAB - The new technology for helping stroke patients get better is a big help to many 
      people with health problems.Newer technologies are now more common, and more 
      patients are using remote health care monitoring. We need to do more research to 
      figure out if these digital health technologies work well over a long period of 
      time.This study connects digital technology and stroke rehab research. It looks 
      at different research areas and trends, and gives a wider view than other similar 
      studies. The findings show where more research should be done and help 
      researchers work together in different areas to improve our knowledge of stroke 
      rehabilitation.

      monitoring of lymphedema is crucial for the development of client-centered 
      treatment plans for post-cancer surgery patients. Therefore, this comprehensive 
      scoping review aimed to investigate the current technology methods used for the 
      remote monitoring of BCRL and their potential to facilitate telehealth in the 
      treatment of lymphedema. Initially, five electronic databases were systematically 
      searched and analyzed following the PRISMA flow diagram. Studies were included, 
      specifically if they provided data on the effectiveness of the intervention and 
      were designed for the remote monitoring of BCRL. A total of 25 included studies 
      reported 18 technological solutions to remotely monitor BCRL with significant 
      methodological variation. Additionally, the technologies were categorized by 
      method of detection and wearability. The findings of this comprehensive scoping 
      review indicate that state-of-the-art commercial technologies were found to be 
      more appropriate for clinical use than home monitoring, with portable 3D imaging 
      tools being popular (SD 53.40) and accurate (correlation 0.9, p 0.05) for 
      evaluating lymphedema in both clinic and home settings with expert practitioners 
      and therapists. However, wearable technologies showed the most future potential 
      for accessible and clinical long-term lymphedema management with positive 
      telehealth outcomes. In conclusion, the absence of a viable telehealth device 
      highlights the need for urgent research to develop a wearable device that can 
      effectively track BCRL and facilitate remote monitoring, ultimately improving the 
      quality of life for patients following post-cancer treatment.

AB  - Digital health tools can improve health care access and outcomes for individuals 
      with limited access to health care, particularly those residing in rural areas. 
      This scoping review examines the existing literature on using digital tools in 
      patients with limited access to health care in rural areas. It assesses their 
      effectiveness in improving health outcomes. The review adopts a comprehensive 
      search strategy to identify relevant studies from electronic databases, and the 
      selected studies are analyzed descriptively. The findings highlight the 
      advantages and barriers of digital health interventions in rural populations. The 
      advantages include increased access to health care practitioners through 
      teleconsultations, improved health care outcomes through remote monitoring, 
      better disease management through mobile health applications and wearable 
      devices, and enhanced access to specialized care and preventive programs. 
      However, limited internet connectivity and a lack of familiarity with digital 
      tools are barriers that must be addressed to ensure equitable access to digital 
      health interventions in rural areas. Overall, digital tools improve health 
      outcomes for individuals with limited health care access in rural areas.

TI  - Wearable Activity Monitors in Home Based Exercise Therapy for Patients with 
      Intermittent Claudication: A Systematic Review.
PG  - 676-687

LID - 10.1016/j.ejvs.2020.11.044 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Intermittent claudication (IC) can severely limit functional capacity 
      and quality of life. Supervised exercise therapy is the recommended first line 
      management; however, this is often limited by accessibility, compliance and cost. 
      As such, there has been an increased interest in the use of wearable activity 
      monitors (WAMs) in home based telemonitoring exercise programmes for claudicants. 
      This review aims to evaluate the efficacy of WAM as a feedback and monitoring 
      tool in home based exercise programmes for patients with IC. DATA SOURCES: A 
      search strategy was devised. The databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science 
      were searched through to April 2020. REVIEW METHODS: Randomised trials and 
      prospective trials were included. Eligible trials had to incorporate WAMs as a 
      feedback tool to target walking/exercise behaviour. The primary outcome was the 
      change in walking ability. Study quality was assessed with risk of bias tool. 
      RESULTS: A total of 1148 records were retrieved. Of these, eight randomised 
      controlled trials and one prospective cohort study, all of which compared a WAM 
      intervention against standard care and/or supervised exercise, met the inclusion 
      criteria. Owing to heterogeneity between studies, no meta-analysis was conducted. 
      WAM interventions improved measures of walking ability (heterogeneous outcomes 
      such as maximum walking distance, claudication distance and six minute walk 
      distance), increased daily walking activity (steps/day), cardiovascular metrics 
      (maximum oxygen consumption), and quality of life. CONCLUSION: There is some 
      evidence that home based WAM interventions are beneficial for improving walking 
      ability and quality of life in patients with IC. However, existing studies are 
      limited by inadequate sample size, duration, and appropriate power. Achieving 
      consensus on outcome reporting and study methods, as well as maximising device 
      adherence, is needed.

AB  - The medical technology sector is characterised by a constant influx of 
      innovations with the potential to revolutionise patient care. In France, there 
      are several pathways for medical devices to enter the market, from 
      diagnosis-related group tariffs to reimbursement lists. However, traditional 
      regulatory pathways can delay market access for innovative technologies. In 
      response, France has established Early Access Programs to expedite patient access 
      to medical devices. This paper looks at three of these Early Access Programs for 
      medical devices. Innovation Funding, introduced in its final version in 2015, 
      provides temporary coverage for innovative devices and facilitates data 
      collection for informed funding decisions. Transitional Coverage (PECT), 
      established in 2021, targets CE-marked devices for rare or serious conditions. 
      Transitional coverage for digital health applications (PECAN), introduced in 
      2022, covers digital medical devices, either therapeutic or for patient 
      monitoring. Innovation funding has been granted to 16 technologies out of 35 
      applications (46%) since 2015. 6 technologies out of 11 (64%) applications 
      benefit from PECT. PECAN, in its first year, has granted a telemonitoring 
      solution with a favourable opinion. The French experience could provide valuable 
      lessons for the development of a harmonised European framework to ensure that 
      innovative medical technologies benefit those who need them, while maintaining 
      high safety standards.

TI  - Continuous Vital Signs Monitoring with a Wireless Device on a General Ward: A 
      Survey to Explore Nurses' Experiences in a Post-Implementation Period.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph20105794 [doi]
LID - 5794
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nurse engagement, perceived need and usefulness affect healthcare 
      technology use, acceptance and improvements in quality, safety and accessibility 
      of healthcare. Nurses' opinions regarding continuous monitoring appear to be 
      positive. However, facilitators and barriers were little studied. This study 
      explored nurses' post-implementation experiences of the facilitators and barriers 
      to continuously monitoring patients' vital signs using a wireless device on 
      general hospital wards. METHODS: This study employed a cross-sectional survey. 
      Vocational and registered nurses from three general wards in a Dutch tertiary 
      university hospital participated in a survey comprising open and closed 
      questions. The data were analysed using thematic analysis and descriptive 
      statistics. RESULTS: Fifty-eight nurses (51.3%) completed the survey. Barriers 
      and facilitators were identified under four key themes: (1) timely signalling and 
      early action, (2) time savings and time consumption, (3) patient comfort and 
      satisfaction and (4) preconditions. CONCLUSIONS: According to nurses, early 
      detection and intervention for deteriorating patients facilitate the use and 
      acceptance of continuously monitoring vital signs. Barriers primarily concern 
      difficulties connecting patients correctly to the devices and system.

TI  - PPG2ECGps: An End-to-End Subject-Specific Deep Neural Network Model for 
      Electrocardiogram Reconstruction from Photoplethysmography Signals without Pulse 
      Arrival Time Adjustments.

AB  - Electrocardiograms (ECGs) provide crucial information for evaluating a patient's 
      cardiovascular health; however, they are not always easily accessible. 
      Photoplethysmography (PPG), a technology commonly used in wearable devices such 
      as smartwatches, has shown promise for constructing ECGs. Several methods have 
      been proposed for ECG reconstruction using PPG signals, but some require signal 
      alignment during the training phase, which is not feasible in real-life settings 
      where ECG signals are not collected at the same time as PPG signals. To address 
      this challenge, we introduce PPG2ECGps, an end-to-end, patient-specific 
      deep-learning neural network utilizing the W-Net architecture. This novel 
      approach enables direct ECG signal reconstruction from PPG signals, eliminating 
      the need for signal alignment. Our experiments show that the proposed model 
      achieves mean values of 0.977 mV for Pearson's correlation coefficient, 0.037 mV 
      for the root mean square error, and 0.010 mV for the normalized dynamic 
      time-warped distance when comparing reconstructed ECGs to reference ECGs from a 
      dataset of 500 records. As PPG signals are more accessible than ECG signals, our 
      proposed model has significant potential to improve patient monitoring and 
      diagnosis in healthcare settings via wearable devices.

TI  - Digital Interventions for Depression and Anxiety in Older Adults: Protocol for a 
      Systematic Review.
PG  - e22738
LID - 10.2196/22738 [doi]
LID - e22738
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a high prevalence of older adults experiencing depression 
      and anxiety. In response to heightened demands for mental health interventions 
      that are accessible and affordable, there has been a recent rise in the number of 
      digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) that have been developed and 
      incorporated into mental health treatments. Digital interventions are promising 
      in their ability to provide researchers, medical practitioners, and patients with 
      personalized tools for assessing behavior, consultation, treatment, and care that 
      can be used remotely. Reviews and meta-analyses have shown the benefits of DMHIs 
      for the treatment and prevention of depression, anxiety, and other mental 
      illnesses, but there is still a lack of studies that focus on the benefits and 
      use of DMHIs in the older population. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic 
      review is to investigate the current evidence for the effect of 
      technology-delivered interventions, such as smartphone/tablet applications, 
      remote monitoring and tracking devices, and wearable technology, for the 
      treatment and prevention of depression and anxiety in adults older than 50 years. 
      METHODS: The academic databases SCOPUS, PsycINFO, AgeLine (EBSCO), and Medline 
      (PubMed) will be searched from January 1, 2010, to the date of search 
      commencement to provide a review of existing randomized controlled trial studies. 
      The search will include 3 key concepts: "older adults," "digital intervention," 
      and "depression/anxiety." A set of inclusion criteria will be followed during 
      screening by two reviewers. Data will be extracted to address aims and objectives 
      of the review. The risk of bias for each study will be determined using 
      appropriate tools. If possible, a random-effects meta-analysis will be performed, 
      and the heterogeneity of effect sizes will be calculated. RESULTS: Preliminary 
      searches were conducted in September 2020. The review is anticipated to be 
      completed by April 2021. CONCLUSIONS: The data accumulated in this systematic 
      review will demonstrate the potential benefits of technology-delivered 
      interventions for the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders in older 
      adults. This review will also identify any gaps in current studies of aging and 
      mental health interventions, thereby navigating a way to move forward and paving 
      the path to more accessible and user-friendly digital health interventions for 
      the diverse population of older adults. TRIAL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO

TI  - [The methodology of remote monitoring of patients with urinary stone disease: 
      development and primary approbation].
PG  - 26-34
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Urolithiasis is a clinically and socially significant disease that 
      requires long-term follow-up in order to prevent stone recurrence. Currently, 
      telemedicine consultations in the "patient-doctor" format are actively used in 
      urology, however, the methodology, technological base and assessment of the 
      efficiency of remote monitoring of the patient's health status are virtually not 
      developed. AIM: To provide basics for the methodology of remote monitoring of 
      patients with urolithiasis for detailed comprehensive examination and 
      comprehensive metaphylaxis of recurrent stone formation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 
      comprehensive clinical examination was carried out on the basis of the Institute 
      of Urology and Human Reproductive Health, the National Medical Research Center on 
      Urology and the Institute of Digital Medicine of FGAOU VO I.M. Sechenov First 
      Moscow State Medical University during the period from 1st February to 1st 
      December 2020. A total of 30 patients with urolithiasis were included in the 
      study. Remote monitoring of health status was carried out using a portable 
      analyzer "ETTA AMP-01" on dipstick. Data transmission was performed through a 
      mobile application, which is part of the "NetHealth" information system 
      (www.nethealth.ru). The values and frequency of urine tests performed by the 
      patient independently, as well as patient satisfaction and adherence to the 
      monitoring technology were evaluated. Analytical, clinical, sociological and 
      statistical research methods were used. RESULTS: By systematizing published data 
      and our own clinical experience, we have developed a model for remote monitoring 
      of the health status of patients with urinary stone disease, which included a 
      system of indications and contraindications, a program and an order of the 
      monitoring, as well as a basic technological solution (medical devices and a 
      hardware-software complex). In this study, median duration of remote monitoring 
      was 168 days. According to the questionnaire, general positive assessment and 
      desire to continue telemonitoring was seen in 100.0% of cases, while 86.7% of 
      patients positively evaluated the technical accessibility and reliability of the 
      system and 93.3% considered the quality and availability of medical care as high. 
      CONCLUSION: A methodology for remote monitoring of patients with urolithiasis has 
      been developed with the aim of preventing recurrent stone formation. There was a 
      high adherence of patients to remote monitoring with a tendency to decrease in 
      values after 4 and 6 months. During these periods, it is necessary to carry out 
      routine consultations by the physician who appointed remote monitoring in order 
      to continue the follow-up program. There was a high satisfaction of patients with 
      remote monitoring, and they pointed out the quality and availability of 
      urological care owing to telemedicine technologies.

AB  - Patients are required to be observed and treated continually in some emergency 
      situations. However, due to time constraints, visiting the hospital to execute 
      such tasks is challenging. This can be achieved using a remote healthcare 
      monitoring system. The proposed system introduces an effective data science 
      technique for IoT supported healthcare monitoring system with the rapid adoption 
      of cloud computing that enhances the efficiency of data processing and the 
      accessibility of data in the cloud. Many IoT sensors are employed, which collect 
      real healthcare data. These data are retained in the cloud for the processing of 
      data science. In the Healthcare Monitoring-Data Science Technique (HM-DST), 
      initially, an altered data science technique is introduced. This algorithm is 
      known as the Improved Pigeon Optimization (IPO) algorithm, which is employed for 
      grouping the stored data in the cloud, which helps in improving the prediction 
      rate. Next, the optimum feature selection technique for extraction and selection 
      of features is illustrated. A Backtracking Search-Based Deep Neural Network 
      (BS-DNN) is utilized for classifying human healthcare. The proposed system's 
      performance is finally examined with various healthcare datasets of real time and 
      the variations are observed with the available smart healthcare systems for 
      monitoring.

TI  - Assessing Free-Living Postural Sway in Persons With Multiple Sclerosis.
PG  - 967-973
LID - 10.1109/TNSRE.2024.3366903 [doi]
AB  - Postural instability is associated with disease status and fall risk in Persons 
      with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS). However, assessments of postural instability, 
      known as postural sway, leverage force platforms or wearable accelerometers, and 
      are most often conducted in laboratory environments and are thus not broadly 
      accessible. Remote measures of postural sway captured during daily life may 
      provide a more accessible alterative, but their ability to capture disease status 
      and fall risk has not yet been established. We explored the utility of remote 
      measures of postural sway in a sample of 33 PwMS. Remote measures of sway 
      differed significantly from lab-based measures, but still demonstrated moderately 
      strong associations with patient-reported measures of balance and mobility 
      impairment. Machine learning models for predicting fall risk trained on lab data 
      provided an Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.79, while remote data only achieved an 
      AUC of 0.51. Remote model performance improved to an AUC of 0.74 after a new, 
      subject-specific k-means clustering approach was applied for identifying the 
      remote data most appropriate for modelling. This cluster-based approach for 
      analyzing remote data also strengthened associations with patient-reported

AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of the study is to assess the experiences, barriers, and 
      expectations regarding current patient monitoring systems among intensive care 
      unit nurses at one university hospital. METHODS: A qualitative exploratory study 
      approach was adopted to test the research questions. RESULTS: Intensive care unit 
      personnel placed a high value on practical criteria such as user friendliness and 
      visualization while assessing the present monitoring system. Poor alarm handling 
      was recognized as possible patient safety hazards. The necessity of high 
      accessibility was highlighted once again for a prospective system; wireless, 
      noninvasive, and interoperability of monitoring devices were requested; and smart 
      phones for distant patient monitoring and alert management improvement were 
      required. CONCLUSION: Core comments from ICU personnel are included in this 
      qualitative research on patient monitoring. All national healthcare involved 
      parties must focus more on user-derived insights to ensure a speedy and effective 
      introduction of digital health technologies in the ICU. The findings from the 
      alarm control or mobile device studies might be utilized to train ICU personnel 
      to use new technology, minimize alarm fatigue, increase medical device 
      accessibility, and develop interoperability standards in critical care practice.

TI  - Cardiac Function Monitoring for Patients Undergoing Cancer Treatments Using 
      Wearable Seismocardiography: A Proof-of-Concept Study.
PG  - 4075-4078
LID - 10.1109/EMBC44109.2020.9176074 [doi]
AB  - Advances in cancer therapeutics have dramatically improved the survival rate and 
      quality of life in patients affected by various cancers, but have been 
      accompanied by treatment-related cardiotoxicity, e.g. left ventricular (LV) 
      dysfunction and/or overt heart failure (HF). Cardiologists thus need to assess 
      cancer treatment-related cardiotoxic risks and have close followups for cancer 
      survivors and patients undergoing cancer treatments using serial echocardiography 
      exams and cardiovascular biomarkers testing. Unfortunately, the cost-prohibitive 
      nature of echocardiography has made these routine follow-ups difficult and not 
      accessible to the growing number of cancer survivors and patients undergoing 
      cancer treatments. There is thus a need to develop a wearable system that can 
      yield similar information at a minimal cost and can be used for remote monitoring 
      of these patients. In this proof-of-concept study, we have investigated the use 
      of wearable seismocardiography (SCG) to monitor LV function non-invasively for 
      patients undergoing cancer treatment. A total of 12 subjects (six with normal LV 
      relaxation, five with impaired relaxation and one with pseudo-normal relaxation) 
      underwent routine echocardiography followed by a standard six-minute walk test. 
      Wearable SCG and electrocardiogram signals were collected during the six-minute 
      walk test and, later, the signal features were compared between subjects with 
      normal and impaired LV relaxation. Pre-ejection period (PEP) from SCG decreased 
      significantly (p < 0.05) during exercise for the subjects with impaired 
      relaxation compared to the subjects with normal relaxation, and changes in PEP/LV 
      ejection time (LVET) were also significantly different between these two groups 
      (p < 0.05). These results suggest that wearable SCG may enable monitoring of 
      patients undergoing cancer treatments by assessing cardiotoxicity.

AB  - This paper analyzes the application of various telemedicine services in Gansu 
      Province, China during the COVID-19 epidemic, and summarizes the experiences with 
      these services. In addition, the satisfaction levels of patients and doctors with 
      the application of telemedicine in COVID-19 were investigated, the deficiencies 
      of telemedicine in Gansu were determined, and recommendations for modification 
      were proposed. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has broken out in China, and 
      Gansu Province in Northwest of China has not been spared. To date, there are 91 
      local COVID-19 cases and 42 imported cases. 109 hospitals were selected as 
      designated hospitals during the COVID-19 outbreak, and most of them were 
      secondary hospitals. However, it was unsatisfactory that the ability of medical 
      services is relatively low in most of secondary hospitals and primary hospitals. 
      Therefore, we helped the secondary hospitals cope with COVID-19 by means of 
      remote consultation, long-distance education, telemedicine question and answer 
      (Q&A). Our practical experience shows that telemedicine can be widely used during 
      the COVID-19 epidemic, especially in developing countries and areas with lagging 
      medical standards.

AB  - The development of high-performance glucose sensors is an urgent need, especially 
      for diabetes mellitus diagnosis. However, the glucose monitoring is 
      conventionally operated in an invasive finger-prick manner and their noninvasive 
      alternatives largely suffered from the relatively poor sensitivity, selectivity, 
      and stability, resulted from the lack of robust and efficient catalysts. In this 
      paper, we design a concave shaped nitrogen-doped carbon framework embellished 
      with single Co site catalyst (Co SSC) by selectively controlling the etching rate 
      on different facet of carbon substrate, which is beneficial to the diffusion and 
      contact of analyte. The Co SSC prompts a significant improvement in the 
      sensitivity of the solution-gated graphene transistor (SGGT) devices, with three 
      orders of magnitude better than those of SGGT devices without catalysts. Our 
      findings expand the field of single site catalyst in the application of 
      biosensors, diabetes diagnostics and personalized health-care monitoring.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In the Healthcare (HC) sector, the usage of Wireless Sensor 
      Healthcare Networks (WSHN) is attaining specific importance. The sensor device is 
      implanted into the patient's body, and the sensed health information of patients 
      is transformed via data aggregating devices like mobile devices, cameras, and so 
      on, to the doctors. Thus, the early signs of diseases are identified, and remote 
      monitoring of the patient's health is carried out by the physician on time. This 
      aids in improving the health condition of the people and reduces the severity of 
      disorders. But, the security gap in HC remains unresolved, despite various 
      advantages. OBJECTIVE: This work proposes secured data communication in WSHN 
      using Exponential Message Digest5 (EXP-MD5) and Diffie Hellman Secret Key-based 
      Elliptic Curve Cryptography (DHSK-ECC) techniques. METHODS: Primarily, the 
      patient registers their details in the Hospital Cloud Server (HCS). With hospital 
      ID and patient ID, public and private keys are generated during registration. 
      Afterward, by utilizing the Navie Shuffling (NS) technique, nCr combinations are 
      created and shuffled. After shuffling, any of the randomly selected combinations 
      are encoded utilizing the American Standard Code for Information Interchange 
      (ASCII) code. For patient authentication, the ASCII code is further converted 
      into a Quick Response(QR) code. Upon successful registration, the patient logs in 
      to HCS. The patient can book for doctor's appointment if the login details are 
      verified with those of the registered details. On consulting the doctor at the 
      pre-informed time, the digital signature is created utilizing the Universal 
      Unique Salt-based Digital Signature Algorithm (UUS-DSA) for authenticating the 
      patient details. Further, for providing accessibility to all the authorized 
      patients, the registered patients on HCS are considered as nodes. Then, an 
      authorized path is created using the EXP-MD5 technique to protect each individual 
      patient's details. The patient's IoT data is sensed, followed by authorized path 
      creation. The data is encrypted via the DHSK-ECC algorithm for secure data 
      transmission. Lastly, all the information is stored in HCS, so that the patient's 
      health condition is regularly monitored by the doctor and the needy advice is 
      suggested to the patients in the future. Also, hash matching is carried out when 
      the doctor needs to access data. RESULTS: The proposed technique's efficacy is 
      validated by the performance analysis in comparison with other conventional 
      techniques. CONCLUSION: In this proposed research, the authentication is 
      performed in multiple scenarios to enhance data security and user privacy. The 
      patient details are authenticated during registration and verification to access 
      the online consultation only by the authorized person. Further, the patient 
      health information is encrypted in the proposed work after consultation so that 
      the intrusion of medical records by malicious users and data tampering is 
      prevented. Also, the sensed data gathered from patients are transferred to the 
      HCS by creating the authorized path, which further enhances the security of 
      patient data. Thus, the data communication of the WSHN is well-secured in this 
      work through multi-level authentication and improved cryptography techniques.

TI  - A Digital System (YouXin) to Facilitate Self-Management by People With Psychosis 
      in China: Protocol for a Nonrandomized Validity and Feasibility Study With a 
      Mixed Methods Design.
PG  - e45170

AB  - BACKGROUND: Psychosis is one of the most disabling mental health conditions and 
      causes significant personal, social, and economic burden. Accurate and timely 
      symptom monitoring is critical to offering prompt and time-sensitive clinical 
      services. Digital health is a promising solution for the barriers encountered by 
      conventional symptom monitoring approaches, including accessibility, the 
      ecological validity of assessments, and recall bias. However, to date, there has 
      been no digital health technology developed to support self-management for people 
      with psychosis in China. OBJECTIVE: We report the study protocol to evaluate the 
      validity, feasibility, acceptability, usability, and safety of a symptom 
      self-monitoring smartphone app (YouXin; Chinese name ) for people with psychosis 
      in China. METHODS: This is a nonrandomized validity and feasibility study with a 
      mixed methods design. The study was approved by the University of Manchester and 
      Beijing Anding Hospital Research Ethics Committee. YouXin is a smartphone app 
      designed to facilitate symptom self-monitoring for people with psychosis. YouXin 
      has 2 core functions: active monitoring of symptoms (ie, smartphone survey) and 
      passive monitoring of behavioral activity (ie, passive data collection via 
      embedded smartphone sensors). The development process of YouXin utilized a 
      systematic coproduction approach. A series of coproduction consultation meetings 
      was conducted by the principal researcher with service users and clinicians to 
      maximize the usability and acceptability of the app for end users. Participants 
      with psychosis aged 16 years to 65 years were recruited from Beijing Anding 
      Hospital, Beijing, China. All participants were invited to use the YouXin app to 
      self-monitor symptoms for 4 weeks. At the end of the 4-week follow-up, we invited 
      participants to take part in a qualitative interview to explore the acceptability 
      of the app and trial procedures postintervention. RESULTS: Recruitment to the 
      study was initiated in August 2022. Of the 47 participants who were approached 
      for the study from August 2022 to October 2022, 41 participants agreed to take 
      part in the study. We excluded 1 of the 41 participants for not meeting the 
      inclusion criteria, leaving a total of 40 participants who began the study. As of 
      December 2022, 40 participants had completed the study, and the recruitment was 
      complete. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to develop and test a symptom 
      self-monitoring app specifically designed for people with psychosis in China. If 
      the study shows the feasibility of YouXin, a potential future direction is to 
      integrate the app into clinical workflows to facilitate digital mental health 
      care for people with psychosis in China. This study will inform improvements to 
      the app, trial procedures, and implementation strategies with this population. 
      Moreover, the findings of this trial could lead to optimization of digital health 
      technologies designed for people with psychosis in China. INTERNATIONAL

TI  - Design of a Remote Multiparametric Tool to Assess Mental Well-Being and Distress 
      in Young People (mHealth Methods in Mental Health Research Project): Protocol for 
      an Observational Study.
PG  - e51298

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mental health conditions have become a substantial cause of 
      disability worldwide, resulting in economic burden and strain on the public 
      health system. Incorporating cognitive and physiological biomarkers using 
      noninvasive sensors combined with self-reported questionnaires can provide a more 
      accurate characterization of the individual's well-being. Biomarkers such as 
      heart rate variability or those extracted from the electrodermal activity signal 
      are commonly considered as indices of autonomic nervous system functioning, 
      providing objective indicators of stress response. A model combining a set of 
      these biomarkers can constitute a comprehensive tool to remotely assess mental 
      well-being and distress. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to design and validate a 
      remote multiparametric tool, including physiological and cognitive variables, to 
      objectively assess mental well-being and distress. METHODS: This ongoing 
      observational study pursues to enroll 60 young participants (aged 18-34 years) in 
      3 groups, including participants with high mental well-being, participants with 
      mild to moderate psychological distress, and participants diagnosed with 
      depression or anxiety disorder. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are being 
      evaluated through a web-based questionnaire, and for those with a mental health 
      condition, the criteria are identified by psychologists. The assessment consists 
      of collecting mental health self-reported measures and physiological data during 
      a baseline state, the Stroop Color and Word Test as a stress-inducing stage, and 
      a final recovery period. Several variables related to heart rate variability, 
      pulse arrival time, breathing, electrodermal activity, and peripheral temperature 
      are collected using medical and wearable devices. A second assessment is carried 
      out after 1 month. The assessment tool will be developed using self-reported 
      questionnaires assessing well-being (short version of Warwick-Edinburgh Mental 
      Well-being Scale), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7), and depression 
      (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) as the reference. We will perform correlation 
      and principal component analysis to reduce the number of variables, followed by 
      the calculation of multiple regression models. Test-retest reliability, 
      known-group validity, and predictive validity will be assessed. RESULTS: 
      Participant recruitment is being carried out on a university campus and in mental 
      health services. Recruitment commenced in October 2022 and is expected to be 
      completed by June 2024. As of July 2023, we have recruited 41 participants. Most 
      participants correspond to the group with mild to moderate psychological distress 
      (n=20, 49%), followed by the high mental well-being group (n=13, 32%) and those 
      diagnosed with a mental health condition (n=8, 20%). Data preprocessing is 
      currently ongoing, and publication of the first results is expected by September 
      2024. CONCLUSIONS: This study will establish an initial framework for a 
      comprehensive mental health assessment tool, taking measurements from 
      sophisticated devices, with the goal of progressing toward a remotely accessible 
      and objectively measured approach that maintains an acceptable level of accuracy 
      in clinical practice and epidemiological studies. TRIAL REGISTRATION: OSF

TI  - Developing the Accuracy of Vital Sign Measurements Using the Lifelight Software 
      Application in Comparison to Standard of Care Methods: Observational Study 
      Protocol.
PG  - e14326
LID - 10.2196/14326 [doi]
LID - e14326
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vital sign measurements are an integral component of clinical care, 
      but current challenges with the accuracy and timeliness of patient observations 
      can impact appropriate clinical decision making. Advanced technologies using 
      techniques such as photoplethysmography have the potential to automate noncontact 
      physiological monitoring and recording, improving the quality and accessibility 
      of this essential clinical information. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aim to 
      develop the algorithm used in the Lifelight software application and improve the 
      accuracy of its estimated heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and 
      blood pressure measurements. METHODS: This preliminary study will compare 
      measurements predicted by the Lifelight software with standard of care 
      measurements for an estimated population sample of 2000 inpatients, outpatients, 
      and healthy people attending a large acute hospital. Both training datasets and 
      validation datasets will be analyzed to assess the degree of correspondence 
      between the vital sign measurements predicted by the Lifelight software and the 
      direct physiological measurements taken using standard of care methods. Subgroup 
      analyses will explore how the performance of the algorithm varies with particular 
      patient characteristics, including age, sex, health condition, and medication. 
      RESULTS: Recruitment of participants to this study began in July 2018, and data 
      collection will continue for a planned study period of 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Digital health technology is a rapidly evolving area for health and social care. 
      Following this initial exploratory study to develop and refine the Lifelight 
      software application, subsequent work will evaluate its performance across a 
      range of health characteristics, and extended validation trials will support its 
      pathway to registration as a medical device. Innovations in health technology 
      such as this may provide valuable opportunities for increasing the efficiency and 
      accessibility of vital sign measurements and improve health care services on a 
      large scale across multiple health and care settings. INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED

TI  - A Federated Database for Obesity Research: An IMI-SOPHIA Study.
LID - 10.3390/life14020262 [doi]
LID - 262
AB  - Obesity is considered by many as a lifestyle choice rather than a chronic 
      progressive disease. The Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) SOPHIA 
      (Stratification of Obesity Phenotypes to Optimize Future Obesity Therapy) project 
      is part of a momentum shift aiming to provide better tools for the stratification 
      of people with obesity according to disease risk and treatment response. One of 
      the challenges to achieving these goals is that many clinical cohorts are siloed, 
      limiting the potential of combined data for biomarker discovery. In SOPHIA, we 
      have addressed this challenge by setting up a federated database building on 
      open-source DataSHIELD technology. The database currently federates 16 cohorts 
      that are accessible via a central gateway. The database is multi-modal, including 
      research studies, clinical trials, and routine health data, and is accessed using 
      the R statistical programming environment where statistical and machine learning 
      analyses can be performed at a distance without any disclosure of patient-level 
      data. We demonstrate the use of the database by providing a proof-of-concept 
      analysis, performing a federated linear model of BMI and systolic blood pressure, 
      pooling all data from 16 studies virtually without any analyst seeing individual 
      patient-level data. This analysis provided similar point estimates compared to a 
      meta-analysis of the 16 individual studies. Our approach provides a benchmark for 
      reproducible, safe federated analyses across multiple study types provided by 
      multiple stakeholders.

TI  - PUFchain 3.0: Hardware-Assisted Distributed Ledger for Robust Authentication in 
      Healthcare Cyber-Physical Systems.
LID - 10.3390/s24030938 [doi]
LID - 938
AB  - This article presents a novel hardware-assisted distributed ledger-based solution 
      for simultaneous device and data security in smart healthcare. This article 
      presents a novel architecture that integrates PUF, blockchain, and Tangle for 
      Security-by-Design (SbD) of healthcare cyber-physical systems (H-CPSs). 
      Healthcare systems around the world have undergone massive technological 
      transformation and have seen growing adoption with the advancement of 
      Internet-of-Medical Things (IoMT). The technological transformation of healthcare 
      systems to telemedicine, e-health, connected health, and remote health is being 
      made possible with the sophisticated integration of IoMT with machine learning, 
      big data, artificial intelligence (AI), and other technologies. As healthcare 
      systems are becoming more accessible and advanced, security and privacy have 
      become pivotal for the smooth integration and functioning of various systems in 
      H-CPSs. In this work, we present a novel approach that integrates PUF with IOTA 
      Tangle and blockchain and works by storing the PUF keys of a patient's Body Area 
      Network (BAN) inside blockchain to access, store, and share globally. Each 
      patient has a network of smart wearables and a gateway to obtain the 
      physiological sensor data securely. To facilitate communication among various 
      stakeholders in healthcare systems, IOTA Tangle's Masked Authentication Messaging 
      (MAM) communication protocol has been used, which securely enables patients to 
      communicate, share, and store data on Tangle. The MAM channel works in the 
      restricted mode in the proposed architecture, which can be accessed using the 
      patient's gateway PUF key. Furthermore, the successful verification of PUF 
      enables patients to securely send and share physiological sensor data from 
      various wearable and implantable medical devices embedded with PUF. Finally, 
      healthcare system entities like physicians, hospital admin networks, and remote 
      monitoring systems can securely establish communication with patients using MAM 
      and retrieve the patient's BAN PUF keys from the blockchain securely. Our 
      experimental analysis shows that the proposed approach successfully integrates 
      three security primitives, PUF, blockchain, and Tangle, providing decentralized 
      access control and security in H-CPS with minimal energy requirements, data 
      storage, and response time.

AB  - Bioethanol is believed to be an influential revolutionary gift of biotechnology, 
      owing to its elevating global demand and massive production. Pakistan is home to 
      a rich diversity of halophytic flora, convertible into bounteous volumes of 
      bioethanol. On the other hand, the accessibility to the cellulosic part of 
      biomass is a major bottleneck in the successful application of biorefinery 
      processes. The most common pre-treatment procedures existent include 
      physicochemical and chemical approaches, which are not environmentally benign. To 
      overcome these problems, biological pre-treatment has gained importance but the 
      drawback is the low yield of the extracted monosaccharides. The current research 
      was aimed at exploring the best pre-treatment method for the bioconversion of 
      halophyte Atriplex crassifolia into saccharides using three thermostable 
      cellulases. Atriplex crassifolia was subjected to acid, alkali and microwave 
      pre-treatments, followed by compositional analysis of the pre-treated substrates. 
      Maximum delignification i.e. 56.6% was observed in the substrate pre-treated 
      using 3% HCl. Enzymatic saccharification using thermostable cellulases also 
      validated the results where the highest saccharification yield i.e. 39.5% was 
      observed for the sample pre-treated using same. Maximum enzymatic hydrolysis of 
      52.7% was obtained for 0.40 g of the pre-treated halophyte Atriplex crassifolia 
      where Endo-1,4- β -glucanase (300U), Exo-1,4- β -glucanase (400U) and β 
      -1,4-glucosidase (1000U) were simultaneously added and incubated for 6 h at 75°C. 
      The reducing sugar slurry obtained after optimization of saccharification was 
      utilized as glucose in submerged fermentation for bioethanol production. The 
      fermentation medium was inoculated with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, incubated at 
      30°C and 180 rpm for 96 h. Ethanol production was estimated using potassium 
      dichromate method. Maximum production of bioethanol i.e. 16.33% was noted at 
      72 h. It can be concluded from the study that Atriplex crassifolia owing to its 
      high cellulosic content after pre-treatment using dilute acid method, yields 
      substantial amount of reducing sugars and high saccharification rates when 
      subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis using thermostable cellulases, under optimized 
      reaction conditions. Hence, the halophyte Atriplex crassifolia is a beneficial 
      substrate that can be utilized to extract fermentable saccharides for bioethanol 
      production.

AB  - Due to the serious impact of falls on the autonomy and health of older people, 
      the investigation of wearable alerting systems for the automatic detection of 
      falls has gained considerable scientific interest in the field of body 
      telemonitoring with wireless sensors. Because of the difficulties of 
      systematically validating these systems in a real application scenario, Fall 
      Detection Systems (FDSs) are typically evaluated by studying their response to 
      datasets containing inertial sensor measurements captured during the execution of 
      labelled nonfall and fall movements. In this context, during the last decade, 
      numerous publicly accessible databases have been released aiming at offering a 
      common benchmarking tool for the validation of the new proposals on FDSs. This 
      work offers a comparative and updated analysis of these existing repositories. 
      For this purpose, the samples contained in the datasets are characterized by 
      different statistics that model diverse aspects of the mobility of the human body 
      in the time interval where the greatest change in the acceleration module is 
      identified. By using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) on the series of these 
      features, the comparison shows the significant differences detected between the 
      datasets, even when comparing activities that require a similar degree of 
      physical effort. This heterogeneity, which may result from the great variability 
      of the sensors, experimental users, and testbeds employed to generate the 
      datasets, is relevant because it casts doubt on the validity of the conclusions 
      of many studies on FDSs, since most of the proposals in the literature are only 
      evaluated using a single database.

PG  - 237-246
LID - 10.1007/s40368-024-00878-7 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The potential of combining teledentistry and engaging parents as 
      underutilised resources to monitor paediatric dental health was emphasised during 
      the COVID-19 pandemic and remains underexplored. This study aims to assess 
      parental acceptance and use of a commercially available intraoral camera (IOC) 
      for effective remote monitoring. METHODS: 47 child-parent dyads, where the parent 
      was the main caregiver and the child was treated under general anaesthesia for 
      early childhood caries, were recruited. Caregivers were trained to image their 
      child's teeth on a commercially available IOC. Subsequently, submitted images 
      were reviewed asynchronously by dentists for image quality, presence of dislodged 
      fillings, abscesses, cavitation, and oral hygiene. Post-surgery monitoring was 
      performed using teledentistry at 1 and 2 months and in-person at 4 months. A 
      modified Telehealth Usability Questionnaire (TUQ) was used to record caregiver 
      acceptance for study procedures. RESULTS: A mean TUQ of 6.09 out of 7 was scored 
      by caregivers. Caregiver-reported issues were limited to problems with technique 
      and child uncooperativeness. The number of clear images during the second 
      teledentistry review was improved compared to the first (p = 0.007). 68% of 
      children liked having images of their teeth taken. CONCLUSION: This study 
      supports the feasibility of using an IOC as a clinically appropriate avenue for 
      teledentistry with a high level of caregiver-child acceptance.

LID - 10.1111/jdv.19361 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cutaneous metastasis (CM) refers to the spread of malignancy to the 
      skin. CM is perceived as an advanced stage. It might be the first sign of a 
      primary cancer or an indicator of recurrence. OBJECTIVES: To identify primary 
      cancers associated with CMs and perform a survival analysis according to advanced 
      stage of cutaneous metastasis at a single tertiary centre in Korea. METHODS: A 
      total of 219 patients from Samsung Medical Center from January 2009 to April 2020 
      were retrospectively analysed to identify cases with biopsy-proven CMs. According 
      to advanced stage of metastasis, patients were divided into three stages, CM only 
      (CMO), CM with lymph node metastasis (CM/LM) and CM with distant metastasis 
      (CM/DM), to analyse clinical characteristics and survival rate. RESULTS: The most 
      common CM from primary cancer was breast cancer, followed by lung cancer, stomach 
      cancer, colorectal cancer and others. When all primary cancers were included, the 
      median survival period was 4.82 years for the CMO stage, 2.15 years for the CM/LM 
      stage and 0.80 years for the CM/DM stage, with a tendency to deteriorate with 
      advancing stage. At 1- and 3-year after occurrence of CM, the CM/DM stage showed 
      a significantly poorer survival rate than the other two stages. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      study showed a median survival period of 22 months for CM patients overall. 
      Breast cancer has greater accessibility to the skin than other cancers. 
      Therefore, breast cancer can metastasize to the skin without involving lymph 
      nodes or other sites.

TI  - Penetrating Barriers: Noncontact Measurement of Vital Bio Signs Using Radio 
      Frequency Technology.
LID - 10.3390/s24175784 [doi]
LID - 5784
AB  - The noninvasive measurement and sensing of vital bio signs, such as respiration 
      and cardiopulmonary parameters, has become an essential part of the evaluation of 
      a patient's physiological condition. The demand for new technologies that 
      facilitate remote and noninvasive techniques for such measurements continues to 
      grow. While previous research has made strides in the continuous monitoring of 
      vital bio signs using lasers, this paper introduces a novel technique for remote 
      noncontact measurements based on radio frequencies. Unlike laser-based methods, 
      this innovative approach offers the advantage of penetrating through walls and 
      tissues, enabling the measurement of respiration and heart rate. Our method, 
      diverging from traditional radar systems, introduces a unique sensing concept 
      that enables the detection of micro-movements in all directions, including those 
      parallel to the antenna surface. The main goal of this work is to present a 
      novel, simple, and cost-effective measurement tool capable of indicating changes 
      in a subject's condition. By leveraging the unique properties of radio 
      frequencies, this technique allows for the noninvasive monitoring of vital bio 
      signs without the need for physical contact or invasive procedures. Moreover, the 
      ability to penetrate barriers such as walls and tissues opens new possibilities 
      for remote monitoring in various settings, including home healthcare, hospital 
      environments, and even search and rescue operations. In order to validate the 
      effectiveness of this technique, a series of experiments were conducted using a 
      prototype device. The results demonstrated the feasibility of accurately 
      measuring respiration patterns and heart rate remotely, showcasing the potential 
      for real-time monitoring of a patient's physiological parameters. Furthermore, 
      the simplicity and low-cost nature of the proposed measurement tool make it 
      accessible to a wide range of users, including healthcare professionals, 
      caregivers, and individuals seeking to monitor their own health.

AB  - Phosphorus recovery from urine is a sustainable approach. However, the challenge 
      of this process is the accessibility of economically feasible magnesium sources. 
      This study aimed to investigate the potential of low-cost Rift Valley Lake 
      magnesium (RVL-Mg) source for phosphorus recovery from urine, where data is 
      deficient in the source area. The effect of various operational conditions such 
      as storage, Mg:P ratio (0.8-2.0), pH (5.5-10.5), mixing speed (30-180 rpm), 
      urease enzyme addition (50-700 μL), urine dilution (0.11-9.0) and Ca:Mg ratio 
      (0.3-2.5) was investigated. Under optimum operating conditions (M:P = 1.6, 
      pH = 9, urease enzyme = 500 μL, mixing speed = 120 rpm, 60 min precipitation), 
      the phosphorus removal efficiencies were >96% for actual and >98% for synthetic 
      urine. During storage, spontaneous phosphorus losses were observed from synthetic 
      (24.0%) and actual (32.0%) hydrolyzed urine due to precipitation with calcium and 
      magnesium. The phosphorus recovery efficiency was reduced at higher (0.11:1) and 
      lower (9:1) urine to RVL-Mg dilution, which is related to lower supersaturation 
      of phosphorus and magnesium ions, respectively. Addition of calcium did not 
      affect phosphorus removal efficiency, but the effect was significant on crystal 
      product. With low (<1.0) Ca:Mg ratio, the crystal chemical analysis showed that 
      the product has to be pure struvite (>99%), which was further identified by 
      scanning electron microscope and X-ray diffraction to be quality struvite that 
      might be used for agricultural purpose. Overall, low-cost magnesium ion collected 
      from Rift Valley Lake can be a potentially candidate for sustainable phosphorus 
      recovery from urine and any other phosphorus containing waste stream.

AB  - Mobile and wearable technologies offer patients with diabetes mellitus new 
      possibilities for data collection and their more effective analysis. The 
      Diabesdagboga smartphone application and the Diani web portal enable to collect 
      and analyze glycaemia values, carbohydrates intake, insulin doses and the level 
      of physical activity. The data are not only accessible in the corresponding 
      smartphone but also automatically transferred to an Internet portal, where they 
      may be completed by the records from an electronic pedometer and continuous 
      glucose monitor. All these data may then be displayed in various types of 
      graphical outputs and are available to both the patient and the physician. The 
      case report of a patient who has used the system for almost two years shows a 
      significant improvement in metabolic compensation (a decrease in the mean HbA1c 
      value by 18.6 mmol/mol as compared with the previous period).
