AB  - Clonal evolution of a tumor ecosystem depends on different selection pressures 
      that are principally immune and treatment mediated. We integrate RNA-seq, DNA 
      sequencing, TCR-seq and SNP array data across multiple regions of liver cancer 
      specimens to map spatio-temporal interactions between cancer and immune cells. We 
      investigate how these interactions reflect intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH) by 
      correlating regional neo-epitope and viral antigen burden with the regional 
      adaptive immune response. Regional expression of passenger mutations dominantly 
      recruits adaptive responses as opposed to hepatitis B virus and cancer-testis 
      antigens. We detect different clonal expansion of the adaptive immune system in 
      distant regions of the same tumor. An ITH-based gene signature improves 
      single-biopsy patient survival predictions and an expression survey of 38,553 
      single cells across 7 regions of 2 patients further reveals heterogeneity in 
      liver cancer. These data quantify transcriptomic ITH and how the different 
      components of the HCC ecosystem interact during cancer evolution.

TI  - Do patients benefit from omega-3 fatty acids?
PG  - 2884-2901
LID - 10.1093/cvr/cvad188 [doi]
AB  - Omega-3 fatty acids (O3FAs) possess beneficial properties for cardiovascular (CV) 
      health and elevated O3FA levels are associated with lower incident risk for CV 
      disease (CVD.) Yet, treatment of at-risk patients with various O3FA formulations 
      has produced disparate results in large, well-controlled and well-conducted 
      clinical trials. Prescription formulations and fish oil supplements containing 
      low-dose mixtures of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 
      have routinely failed to prevent CV events in primary and secondary prevention 
      settings when added to contemporary care, as shown most recently in the STRENGTH 
      and OMEMI trials. However, as observed in JELIS, REDUCE-IT, and RESPECT-EPA, 
      EPA-only formulations significantly reduce CVD events in high-risk patients. The 
      CV mechanism of action of EPA, while certainly multifaceted, does not depend 
      solely on reductions of circulating lipids, including triglycerides (TG) and LDL, 
      and event reduction appears related to achieved EPA levels suggesting that the 
      particular chemical and biological properties of EPA, as compared to DHA and 
      other O3FAs, may contribute to its distinct clinical efficacy. In vitro and in 
      vivo studies have shown different effects of EPA compared with DHA alone or 
      EPA/DHA combination treatments, on atherosclerotic plaque morphology, LDL and 
      membrane oxidation, cholesterol distribution, membrane lipid dynamics, glucose 
      homeostasis, endothelial function, and downstream lipid metabolite function. 
      These findings indicate that prescription-grade, EPA-only formulations provide 
      greater benefit than other O3FAs formulations tested. This review summarizes the 
      clinical findings associated with various O3FA formulations, their efficacy in 
      treating CV disease, and their underlying mechanisms of action.

TI  - Health Care Monitoring and Treatment for Coronary Artery Diseases: Challenges and 
      Issues.

AB  - In-stent restenosis concerning the coronary artery refers to the blood 
      clotting-caused re-narrowing of the blocked section of the artery, which is 
      opened using a stent. The failure rate for stents is in the range of 10% to 15%, 
      where they do not remain open, thereby leading to about 40% of the patients with 
      stent implantations requiring repeat procedure within one year, despite increased 
      risk factors and the administration of expensive medicines. Hence, today stent 
      restenosis is a significant cause of deaths globally. Monitoring and treatment 
      matter a lot when it comes to early diagnosis and treatment. A review of the 
      present stent monitoring technology as well as the practical treatment for 
      addressing stent restenosis was conducted. The problems and challenges associated 
      with current stent monitoring technology were illustrated, along with its typical 
      applications. Brief suggestions were given and the progress of stent implants was 
      discussed. It was revealed that prime requisites are needed to achieve good 
      quality implanted stent devices in terms of their size, reliability, etc. This 
      review would positively prompt researchers to augment their efforts towards the 
      expansion of healthcare systems. Lastly, the challenges and concerns associated 
      with nurturing a healthcare system were deliberated with meaningful evaluations.

TI  - Internet of Things-Based ECG and Vitals Healthcare Monitoring System.
LID - 10.3390/mi13122153 [doi]
LID - 2153
AB  - Health monitoring and its associated technologies have gained enormous importance 
      over the past few years. The electrocardiogram (ECG) has long been a popular tool 
      for assessing and diagnosing cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Since the literature 
      on ECG monitoring devices is growing at an exponential rate, it is becoming 
      difficult for researchers and healthcare professionals to select, compare, and 
      assess the systems that meet their demands while also meeting the monitoring 
      standards. This emphasizes the necessity for a reliable reference to guide the 
      design, categorization, and analysis of ECG monitoring systems, which will 
      benefit both academics and practitioners. We present a complete ECG monitoring 
      system in this work, describing the design stages and implementation of an 
      end-to-end solution for capturing and displaying the patient's heart signals, 
      heart rate, blood oxygen levels, and body temperature. The data will be presented 
      on an OLED display, a developed Android application as well as in MATLAB via 
      serial communication. The Internet of Things (IoT) approaches have a clear 
      advantage in tackling the problem of heart disease patient care as they can 
      transform the service mode into a widespread one and alert the healthcare 
      services based on the patient's physical condition. Keeping this in mind, there 
      is also the addition of a web server for monitoring the patient's status via 
      WiFi. The prototype, which is compliant with the electrical safety regulations 
      and medical equipment design, was further benchmarked against a commercially 
      available off-the-shelf device, and showed an excellent accuracy of 99.56%.

AB  - One of the major hurdles faced in tissue engineering is the inability to monitor 
      and control the function of an engineered tissue following transplantation. 
      Recent years have seen major developments in the field by integrating electronics 
      within engineered tissues. Previously, the most common types of devices 
      integrated into the body used to be pacemakers and deep brain stimulation 
      electrodes that are stiff and non-compliant; the advent of ultra-thin and 
      flexible electronics has brought forth a significant expansion of the field. 
      Recent developments have enabled interfacing electronics onto, into, and within 
      all tissues and organs with minimal adverse reactions. These have introduced the 
      ability to engineer tissues with built-in electronics that allow for remote 
      monitoring and regulation of tissue function. In this review, we discuss the 
      development of technologies that allowed for the formation of tissue-electronics 
      hybrids and give an overview of the existing examples of these hybrid "cyborg" 
      tissues.

AB  - Policy Points Millions of life-sustaining implantable devices collect and relay 
      massive amounts of digital health data, increasingly by using user-downloaded 
      smartphone applications to facilitate data relay to clinicians via manufacturer 
      servers. Our analysis of health privacy laws indicates that most US patients may 
      have little access to their own digital health data in the United States under 
      the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Privacy Rule, whereas the 
      EU General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act 
      grant greater access to device-collected data. Our normative analysis argues for 
      consistently granting patients access to the raw data collected by their 
      implantable devices. CONTEXT: Millions of life-sustaining implantable devices 
      collect and relay massive amounts of digital health data, increasingly by using 
      user-downloaded smartphone applications to facilitate data relay to clinicians 
      via manufacturer servers. Whether patients have either legal or normative claims 
      to data collected by these devices, particularly in the raw, granular format 
      beyond that summarized in their medical records, remains incompletely explored. 
      METHODS: Using pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) as a 
      clinical model, we outline the clinical ecosystem of data collection, relay, 
      retrieval, and documentation. We consider the legal implications of US and 
      European privacy regulations for patient access to either summary or raw device 
      data. Lastly, we evaluate ethical arguments for or against providing patients 
      access to data beyond the summaries presented in medical records. FINDINGS: Our 
      analysis of applicable health privacy laws indicates that US patients may have 
      little access to their raw data collected and held by device manufacturers in the 
      United States under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
      Privacy Rule, whereas the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) grants 
      greater access to device-collected data when the processing of personal data 
      falls under the GDPR's territorial scope. The California Consumer Privacy Act, 
      the "little sister" of the GDPR, also grants greater rights to California 
      residents. By contrast, our normative analysis argues for consistently granting 
      patients access to the raw data collected by their implantable devices. 
      Smartphone applications are increasingly involved in the collection, relay, 
      retrieval, and documentation of these data. Therefore, we argue that smartphone 
      user agreements are an emerging but potentially underutilized opportunity for 
      clarifying both legal and ethical claims for device-derived data. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Current health privacy legislation incompletely supports patients' normative 
      claims for access to digital health data.

AB  - The recent pandemic with SARS-CoV-2 raises questions worldwide regarding 
      telemedicine for housebound patients, including those with cardiovascular 
      conditions. The need for further investigation, monitoring and therapeutic 
      management are advancing practical issues which had not been identified for 
      consideration prior to the pandemic. Using the marketing assessment, we 
      identified the needs of the patients and evaluated the future steps necessary in 
      the short term to meet them. The research found progress made via telemedicine in 
      monitoring and conducting minor decisions (like up-titrating the doses of 
      different medication regimens) in patients with several cardiovascular diseases 
      (heart failure, atrial fibrillation, high blood pressure), as there is a 
      worldwide trend to develop new telemonitoring biosensors and devices based on 
      implantable delivered transcatheter. The worldwide telemedicine trend encourages 
      a switch from small and hesitating steps to a more consistent assessment of the 
      patients, based on high technology and Interventional Cardiology. Cardiovascular 
      telemedicine, although made a sustainable effort in managing patients' health, 
      has many obstacles to overcome before meeting all their needs. Data security, 
      confidentiality and reimbursement are the top priorities in developing remote 
      Cardiology. The regulatory institutions need to play an integrative role in 
      leading the way for defining the framework of future telemedicine activities. The 
      SARS-CoV-2 outbreak with all its tragedy served to reinforce the message that 
      telemedicine services can be life-saving for cardiovascular patients. Once the 
      Covid-19 era will fade away, telemedicine is likely to remain a complementary 
      service of standard care. There is still room to improve the remote 
      identification and investigation of heart disease, provide an accurate diagnosis 
      and therapeutic regimen, and update regulations and guidelines to the new 
      realities of technological progress in the field.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Digitalization of healthcare led to the optimization of monitoring, 
      diagnostics, and treatment of the range of disorders. Taking into account recent 
      situation with COVID-19 pandemics, digital technologies allowed to improve 
      management of viral infections via remote monitoring and diagnostics of infected 
      patients. Up to date, various mobile health applications (apps) have been 
      proposed, including apps for the patients diagnosed with cardiovascular 
      pathologies. OBJECTIVE: The presented review aimed at the analyses of a range of 
      mHealth solutions used to improve primary cardiac care. In addition, we studied 
      the factors driving and hindering the wide introduction of mHealth services in 
      the clinics. METHODS: The work was based on the guidelines of the preferred 
      reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. The 
      publication search was carried out using PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane 
      Library, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases. Studies published during the 
      period from 2014 until January 2022 were selected for the analysis. The 
      evaluation of risk of bias for the included studies was conducted using the 
      Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias tool. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: An overall 5513 
      studies were assessed for eligibility after which 39 studies were included.. The 
      main trend in the mobile health for cardiological applications is the use of 
      different types of wearable devices and Artificial Intelligence-platforms. In 
      fact, mobile technology allows remotely to monitor, interpret, and analyze 
      biomedical data collected from the patient. CONCLUSION: The results of this 
      literature search demonstrated that patients diagnosed with cardiovascular 
      disorders can potentially benefit from the application of mHealth in cardiology. 
      However, despite the proven advantages of mHealth for cardiology, there are many 
      challenges and concerns regarding effectiveness, safety, reliability and the lack 
      of official regulation and guidelines from official organizations. Such issues 
      require solutions and further work towards a wide implementation of mHealth 
      technologies in cardiac practice.

AB  - Electronic-based health care delivery systems are gaining popularity among 
      patients and clinicians because of convenience. Importantly, telemedicine, the 
      delivery of health care and/or health information using electronic systems, can 
      deliver primary and specialized health care to geographically isolated patients, 
      who account for nearly 20% of the US population. In nephrology, where a growing 
      discrepancy exists between the geographic location of nephrologists and patients 
      with kidney disease, telenephrology can bridge distance and deliver renal care 
      and education to the isolated. Large nationalized health care systems, for which 
      incentives are aligned to innovate and implement new platforms to deliver 
      cost-effective care, have been at the forefront of telenephrology. These systems 
      include synchronous direct physician-patient care through clinical 
      videoconferencing, and asynchronous modalities such as electronic consultation 
      and video telehealth to educate internists about specialized clinical topics. 
      Large health care organizations are adopting these platforms as standalone 
      services; however, expansion into the private health care system has been limited 
      by reimbursement, regulations, and other issues. Though telenephrology is patient 
      centered, studies are needed to rigorously test its clinical efficacy and 
      cost-effectiveness. Nonetheless, growing patient demand for patient-centric 
      health care will continue to expand the telenephrology space.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The role of startups has been growing in healthcare delivery, 
      particularly in telehealth and telemedicine. Yet, little has been published about 
      their role in evolving digital healthcare ecosystem. This study aimed to review 
      the literature on telehealth startups to understand their roles, challenges, 
      business models, and directions for sustainable innovation and commercialization. 
      METHODS: Ten databases were screened: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE 
      Xplore, ACM digital library, EBSCOhost, Embase, Medline, Cochrane review, and 
      PsycINFO. The articles were shortlisted based on pre-determined screening 
      criteria, and qualitative synthesis was performed. The quality of included 
      studies was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Cohen's K was 
      calculated to ensure the reliability of the authors scoring on the quality 
      appraisal test and qualitative synthesis. RESULTS: 26 articles were included in 
      the review. Findings are clubbed under five themes: remote and on-demand 
      healthcare; healthcare data management; digital therapeutics; high-tech driven 
      personalized care; and information integration and exchange. Technical 
      infrastructure, regulation, and revenue generation were identified as major 
      challenges for telehealth start-ups. Osterwalder business canvas was the 
      predominantly used model. Value perspectives were recognized for a sustainable 
      telehealth innovation and its commercialization. CONCLUSION: Telehealth startups 
      are evolving to meet digital healthcare needs and playing a significant role in 
      teleconsultations, telemonitoring, and electronic health record solutions. 
      Recently, their focus has shifted towards smartphone-enabled AI-driven 
      personalized care, including digital therapeutics and wearable device innovation. 
      They have significant technical and operational challenges in innovation and 
      commercialization to optimize their role. The review also provides researchers 
      with a new understanding of telehealth startups' sustainable innovation and 
      commercialization through the systematic direction of value proposition, 
      creation, and capture.

AB  - Digital Health Technologies (DHTs) are being applied in a widening range of 
      scenarios in medicine. We describe the emerging phenomenon of the grouping of 
      individual DHTs, with a clinical use case and regulatory approval in their own 
      right, into packages to perform specific clinical tasks in defined settings. 
      Example groupings include suites of devices for remote monitoring, or for smart 
      clinics. In this first article of a two-article series, we describe challenges in 
      implementation and limitations in frameworks for the regulation, health 
      technology assessment, and reimbursement of these device suites and linked novel 
      care pathways.

TI  - The Artificial Intelligence in Teledermatology: A Narrative Review on 
      Opportunities, Perspectives, and Bottlenecks.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph20105810 [doi]
LID - 5810
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is recently seeing significant advances in 
      teledermatology (TD), also thanks to the developments that have taken place 
      during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the last two years, there was an important 
      development of studies that focused on opportunities, perspectives, and problems 
      in this field. The topic is very important because the telemedicine and AI 
      applied to dermatology have the opportunity to improve both the quality of 
      healthcare for citizens and the workflow of healthcare professionals. This study 
      conducted an overview on the opportunities, the perspectives, and the problems 
      related to the integration of TD with AI. The methodology of this review, 
      following a standardized checklist, was based on: (I) a search of PubMed and 
      Scopus and (II) an eligibility assessment, using parameters with five levels of 
      score. The outcome highlighted that applications of this integration have been 
      identified in various skin pathologies and in quality control, both in eHealth 
      and mHealth. Many of these applications are based on Apps used by citizens in 
      mHealth for self-care with new opportunities but also open questions. A 
      generalized enthusiasm has been registered regarding the opportunities and 
      general perspectives on improving the quality of care, optimizing the healthcare 
      processes, minimizing costs, reducing the stress in the healthcare facilities, 
      and in making citizens, now at the center, more satisfied. However, critical 
      issues have emerged related to: (a) the need to improve the process of diffusion 
      of the Apps in the hands of citizens, with better design, validation, 
      standardization, and cybersecurity; (b) the need for better attention paid to 
      medico-legal and ethical issues; and (c) the need for the stabilization of 
      international and national regulations. Targeted agreement initiatives, such as 
      position statements, guidelines, and/or consensus initiatives, are needed to 
      ensure a better result for all, along with the design of both specific plans and 
      shared workflows.

TI  - Advancing Dermatological Care: A Comprehensive Narrative Review of 
      Tele-Dermatology and mHealth for Bridging Gaps and Expanding Opportunities beyond 
      the COVID-19 Pandemic.
LID - 10.3390/healthcare11131911 [doi]
LID - 1911
AB  - Mobile health (mHealth) has recently had significant advances in tele-dermatology 
      (TD) thanks to the developments following the COVID-19 pandemic. This topic is 
      very important, as telemedicine and mHealth, when applied to dermatology, could 
      improve both the quality of healthcare for citizens and the workflow in the 
      health domain. The proposed study was centered on the last three years. We 
      conducted an overview on the opportunities, the perspectives, and the problems 
      involved in TD integration with mHealth. The methodology of the narrative review 
      was based on: (I) a search of PubMed and Scopus and (II) an eligibility 
      assessment, using properly proposed parameters. The outcome of the study showed 
      that during the COVID-19 pandemic, TD integration with mHealth advanced rapidly. 
      This integration enabled the monitoring of dermatological problems and 
      facilitated remote specialist visits, reducing face-to-face interactions. AI and 
      mobile apps have empowered citizens to take an active role in their healthcare. 
      This differs from other imaging sectors where information exchange is limited to 
      professionals. The opportunities for TD in mHealth include improving service 
      quality, streamlining healthcare processes, reducing costs, and providing more 
      accessible care. It can be applied to various conditions, such as (but not 
      limited to) acne, vitiligo, psoriasis, and skin cancers. Integration with AI and 
      augmented reality (AR), as well as the use of wearable sensors, are anticipated 
      as future developments. However, integrating TD with mHealth also brings about 
      problems and challenges related to regulations, ethics, cybersecurity, data 
      privacy, and device management. Scholars and policymakers need to address these 
      issues while involving citizens in the process.

TI  - Past, Present and Future of Home video-electroencephalographic telemetry: A 
      review of the development of in-home video-electroencephalographic recordings.
PG  - S3-S10
LID - 10.1111/epi.16578 [doi]
AB  - Video-electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring is an essential tool in 
      epileptology, conventionally carried out in a hospital epilepsy monitoring unit. 
      Due to high costs and long waiting times for hospital admission, coupled with 
      technological advances, several centers have developed and implemented video-EEG 
      monitoring in the patient's home (home video-EEG telemetry [HVET]). Here, we 
      review the history and current status of three general approaches to HVET: (1) 
      supervised HVET, which entails setting up video-EEG in the patient's home with 
      daily visiting technologist support; (2) mobile HVET (also termed ambulatory 
      video-EEG), which entails attaching electrodes in a health care facility, 
      supplying the patient and carers with the hardware and instructions, and then 
      asking the patient and carer to set up recording at home without technologist 
      support; and (3) cloud-based HVET, which adds to either of the previous models 
      continuous streaming of video-EEG from the home to the health care provider, with 
      the option to review data in near real time, troubleshoot hardware remotely, and 
      interact remotely with the patient. Our experience shows that HVET can be highly 
      cost-effective and is well received by patients. We note limitations related to 
      long-term electrode attachment and correct camera placing while the patient is 
      unsupervised at home, and concerns related to regulations regarding data privacy 
      for cloud services. We believe that HVET opens significant new opportunities for 
      research, especially in the field of understanding the many influences in seizure 
      occurrence. We speculate that in the future HVET may merge into innovative new 
      multisensor approaches to continuously monitoring people with epilepsy.

TI  - Performance and Usability Evaluation of an Extended Reality Platform to Monitor 
      Patient's Health during Surgical Procedures.
LID - 10.3390/s22103908 [doi]
LID - 3908
AB  - An extended-reality (XR) platform for real-time monitoring of patients' health 
      during surgical procedures is proposed. The proposed system provides real-time 
      access to a comprehensive set of patients' information, which are made promptly 
      available to the surgical team in the operating room (OR). In particular, the XR 
      platform supports the medical staff by automatically acquiring the patient's 
      vitals from the operating room instrumentation and displaying them in real-time 
      directly on an XR headset. Furthermore, information regarding the patient 
      clinical record is also shown upon request. Finally, the XR-based monitoring 
      platform also allows displaying in XR the video stream coming directly from the 
      endoscope. The innovative aspect of the proposed XR-based monitoring platform 
      lies in the comprehensiveness of the available information, in its modularity and 
      flexibility (in terms of adaption to different sources of data), ease of use, and 
      most importantly, in a reliable communication, which are critical requirements 
      for the healthcare field. To validate the proposed system, experimental tests 
      were conducted using instrumentation typically available in the operating room 
      (i.e., a respiratory ventilator, a patient monitor for intensive care, and an 
      endoscope). The overall results showed (i) an accuracy of the data communication 
      greater than 99 %, along with (ii) an average time response below ms, and (iii) 
      satisfying feedback from the SUS questionnaires filled out by the physicians 
      after intensive use.

TI  - Survey Results and Recommendations from Japanese Stakeholders for Good Clinical 
      Practice Renovation.
PG  - 220-229
LID - 10.1007/s43441-021-00350-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements 
      for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) is undertaking a major revision of ICH E6 
      Good Clinical Practice (GCP) decided to involve external stakeholders in ICH-GCP 
      renovation. Activities such as surveys and public conferences have taken place in 
      the United States, European Union, and Japan. For stakeholder engagement in 
      Japan, a designated research group conducted a survey of academic stakeholders. 
      METHODS: A total of 105 academic stakeholders from 18 institutions responded to 
      the survey. The research group developed recommendations reflecting the survey 
      results and the opinions from patients and the public. RESULTS: The survey showed 
      the top four principles needing renovation were (i) informed consent (Chapter 
      2.9, 12.4% of respondents believed it needed renovation), (ii) systems for 
      quality assurance (Chapter 2.13, 9.5%), (iii) information on an investigational 
      product (Chapter 2.4, 5.7%), and (iv) procedures on clinical trial information 
      (Chapter 2.10, 5.7%). The top three sections identified as needing renovation 
      were: (i) informed consent (Chapter 4.8, 27.6%), (ii) monitoring (Chapter 5.18, 
      22.9%), and (iii) composition, functions, and operations of the ethics committee 
      (Chapter 3.2, 14.3%). Recommendations included clarification of ICH-GCP's scope, 
      proportionality in various aspects of clinical trials, diversity and liquidity of 
      ethics committee members, modernization of informed consent procedures, 
      variations in monitoring, and regulatory grade when using real-world data. 
      CONCLUSION: The recommendations from Japanese investigators and patients have 
      been submitted to the ICH E6 Expert Working Group, which will strengthen the 
      robustness of the GCP renovation.

TI  - Tele-Monitoring of Cancer Patients' Rhythms during Daily Life Identifies 
      Actionable Determinants of Circadian and Sleep Disruption.
LID - 10.3390/cancers12071938 [doi]
LID - 1938
AB  - The dichotomy index (I < O), a quantitative estimate of the circadian regulation 
      of daytime activity and sleep, predicted overall cancer survival and emergency 
      hospitalization, supporting its integration in a mHealth platform. Modifiable 
      causes of I < O deterioration below 97.5%-(I < O)(low)-were sought in 25 
      gastrointestinal cancer patients and 33 age- and sex-stratified controls. 
      Rest-activity and temperature were tele-monitored with a wireless chest sensor, 
      while daily activities, meals, and sleep were self-reported for one week. 
      Salivary cortisol rhythm and dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) were determined. 
      Circadian parameters were estimated using Hidden Markov modelling, and spectral 
      analysis. Actionable predictors of (I < O)(low) were identified through 
      correlation and regression analyses. Median compliance with protocol exceeded 
      95%. Circadian disruption-(I < O)(low)-was identified in 13 (52%) patients and 
      four (12%) controls (p = 0.002). Cancer patients with (I < O)(low) had lower 
      median activity counts, worse fragmented sleep, and an abnormal or no circadian 
      temperature rhythm compared to patients with I < O exceeding 97.5%-(I < 
      O)(high)-(p < 0.012). Six (I < O)(low) patients had newly-diagnosed sleep 
      conditions. Altered circadian coordination of rest-activity and chest surface 
      temperature, physical inactivity, and irregular sleep were identified as 
      modifiable determinants of (I < O)(low). Circadian rhythm and sleep 
      tele-monitoring results support the design of specific interventions to improve 
      outcomes within a patient-centered systems approach to health care.

TI  - Validity of a Novel Research-Grade Physical Activity and Sleep Monitor for 
      Continuous Remote Patient Monitoring.
LID - 10.3390/s21062034 [doi]
LID - 2034
AB  - In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, Remote Patient Monitoring technologies are 
      highly important for clinicians and researchers. These connected-health 
      technologies enable monitoring of patients and facilitate remote clinical trial 
      research while reducing the potential for the spread of the novel coronavirus. 
      There is a growing requirement for monitoring of the full 24 h spectrum of 
      behaviours with a single research-grade sensor. This research describes a 
      free-living and supervised protocol comparison study of the Verisense inertial 
      measurement unit to assess physical activity and sleep parameters and compares it 
      with the Actiwatch 2 actigraph. Fifteen adults (11 males, 23.4 ± 3.4 years and 4 
      females, 29 ± 12.6 years) wore both monitors for 2 consecutive days and nights in 
      the free-living study while twelve adults (11 males, 23.4 ± 3.4 years and 1 
      female, 22 ± 0 years) wore both monitors for the duration of a gym-based 
      supervised protocol study. Agreement of physical activity epoch-by-epoch data 
      with activity classification of sedentary, light and moderate-to-vigorous 
      activity and sleep metrics were evaluated using Spearman's rank-order correlation 
      coefficients and Bland-Altman plots. For all activity, Verisense showed high 
      agreement for both free-living and supervised protocol of r = 0.85 and r = 0.78, 
      respectively. For physical activity classification, Verisense showed high 
      agreement of sedentary activity of r = 0.72 for free-living but low agreement of 
      r = 0.36 for supervised protocol; low agreement of light activity of r = 0.42 for 
      free-living and negligible agreement of r = -0.04 for supervised protocol; and 
      moderate agreement of moderate-to-vigorous activity of r = 0.52 for free-living 
      with low agreement of r = 0.49 for supervised protocol. For sleep metrics, 
      Verisense showed moderate agreement for sleep time and total sleep time of r = 
      0.66 and 0.54, respectively, but demonstrated high agreement for determination of 
      wake time of r = 0.83. Overall, our results showed moderate-high agreement of 
      Verisense with Actiwatch 2 for assessing epoch-by-epoch physical activity and 
      sleep, but a lack of agreement for activity classifications. Future validation 
      work of Verisense for activity cut-point potentially holds promise for 24 h 
      continuous remote patient monitoring.

AB  - With the increasing indispensable role of smartphones in our daily lives, the 
      mobile health care system coupled with embedded physical sensors and modern 
      communication technologies make it an attractive technology for enabling the 
      remote monitoring of an individual's health. Using a multidisciplinary design 
      principle coupled with smart electronics, software, and optogenetics, the 
      investigators constructed smartphone-controlled optogenetic switches to enable 
      the ultraremote-control transgene expression. A custom-designed SmartController 
      system was programmed to process wireless signals from smartphones, enabling the 
      regulation of therapeutic outputs production by optically engineered cells via a 
      far-red light (FRL)-responsive optogenetic interface. In the present study, the 
      investigators describe the details of the protocols for constructing 
      smartphone-controlled optogenetic switches, including the rational design of an 
      FRL-triggered transgene expression circuit, the procedure for cell culture and 
      transfection, the implementation of the smartphone-controlled far-red 
      light-emitting diode (LED) module, and the reporter detection assay.

AB  - Mobile applications provide the healthcare industry with a means of connecting 
      with patients in their own home utilizing their own personal mobile devices such 
      as tablets and phones. This allows therapists to monitor the progress of people 
      under their care from a remote location and all with the added benefit that 
      patients are familiar with their own mobile devices; thereby reducing the time 
      required to train patients with the new technology. There is also the added 
      benefit to the health service that there is no additional cost required to 
      purchase devices for use. The Facial Remote Activity Monitoring Eyewear (FRAME) 
      mobile application and web service framework has been designed to work on the IOS 
      and android platforms, the two most commonly used today. Results: The system 
      utilizes secure cloud based data storage to collect, analyse and store data, this 
      allows for near real time, secure access remotely by therapists to monitor their 
      patients and intervene when required. The underlying framework has been designed 
      to be secure, anonymous and flexible to ensure compliance with the data 
      protection act and the latest General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR); this new 
      standard came into effect in April 2018 and replaces the Data Protection Act in 
      the UK and Europe.

      effects from the physical measures needed to "flatten the curve." Stress, 
      isolation, lack of structure, limited access to physical and mental health care, 
      and changes in treatment paradigms all increase risk of return to drug use events 
      and pose barriers to recovery for people with SUDs. The pandemic has forced 
      treatment providers and facilities to rapidly adapt to address these threats 
      while redesigning their structure to accommodate physical distancing regulations. 
      Digital health interventions can function without the need for physical 
      proximity. Clinicians can use digital health intervention, such as telehealth, 
      wearables, mobile applications, and other remote monitoring devices, to convert 
      in-person care to remote-based care, and they can leverage these tools to address 
      some of the pandemic-specific challenges to treatment. The current pandemic 
      provides the opportunity to rapidly explore the advantages and limitations of 
      these technologies in the care of individuals with SUD.

LID - e62157
AB  - Mobile health (mHealth) interventions have emerged as a promising approach for 
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention and management. The proliferation of 
      smartphones and wearable devices enables convenient access to health monitoring 
      tools, educational resources, and communication with healthcare providers. 
      mHealth interventions encompass mobile apps, wearables, and telehealth services 
      that empower users to monitor vital signs, adhere to medication, and adopt 
      healthier lifestyles. Their effectiveness hinges on user engagement, leveraging 
      behavioral science principles and gamification strategies. While mHealth offers 
      advantages such as personalized support and increased reach, it faces challenges 
      pertaining to data privacy, security concerns, and resistance from healthcare 
      providers. Robust encryption and adherence to regulations like the Health 
      Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) are crucial for safeguarding 
      sensitive health data. Integrating mHealth into clinical workflows can enhance 
      healthcare delivery, but organizational adjustments are necessary. The future of 
      mHealth is closely intertwined with artificial intelligence (AI), enabling remote 
      monitoring, predictive algorithms, and data-driven insights. Tech giants are 
      incorporating advanced health-tracking capabilities into their devices, paving 
      the way for personalized wellness approaches. However, mHealth grapples with 
      ethical dilemmas surrounding data ownership, privacy breaches, and inadvertent 
      data capture. Despite its potential, mHealth necessitates a concerted effort to 
      overcome obstacles and ensure ethical, secure, and practical implementation. 
      Addressing technical challenges, fostering standardization, and promoting 
      equitable access are pivotal for unlocking the transformative impact of mHealth 
      on cardiovascular health and reducing the global burden of CVD.

TI  - Strain-Driven Negative Resistance Switching of Conductive Fibers with Adjustable 
      Sensitivity for Wearable Healthcare Monitoring Systems with Near-Zero Standby 
      Power.
PG  - e2303556
LID - 10.1002/adma.202303556 [doi]
AB  - Recently, one of the primary concerns in e-textile-based healthcare monitoring 
      systems for chronic illness patients has been reducing wasted power consumption, 
      as the system should be always-on to capture diverse biochemical and 
      physiological characteristics. However, the general conductive fibers, a major 
      component of the existing wearable monitoring systems, have a positive 
      gauge-factor (GF) that increases electrical resistance when stretched, so that 
      the systems have no choice but to consume power continuously. Herein, a twisted 
      conductive-fiber-based negatively responsive switch-type (NRS) strain-sensor with 
      an extremely high negative GF (resistance change ratio ≈ 3.9 × 10(8) ) that can 
      significantly increase its conductivity from insulating to conducting properties 
      is developed. To this end, a precision cracking technology is devised, which 
      could induce a difference in the Young's modulus of the encapsulated layer on the 
      fiber through selective ultraviolet-irradiation treatment. Owing to this 
      technology, the NRS strain-sensors can allow for effective regulation of the 
      mutual contact resistance under tensile strain while maintaining superior 
      durability for over 5000 stretching cycles. For further practical demonstrations, 
      three healthcare monitoring systems (E-fitness pants, smart-masks, and posture 
      correction T-shirts) with near-zero standby power are also developed, which opens 
      up advancements in electronic textiles by expanding the utilization range of 
      fiber strain-sensors.

TI  - Interplay between desmoglein2 and hypoxia controls metastasis in breast cancer.
LID - 10.1073/pnas.2014408118 [doi]
LID - e2014408118
AB  - Metastasis is the major cause of cancer death. An increased level of circulating 
      tumor cells (CTCs), metastatic cancer cells that have intravasated into the 
      circulatory system, is particularly associated with colonization of distant 
      organs and poor prognosis. However, the key factors required for tumor cell 
      dissemination and colonization remain elusive. We found that high expression of 
      desmoglein2 (DSG2), a component of desmosome-mediated intercellular adhesion 
      complexes, promoted tumor growth, increased the prevalence of CTC clusters, and 
      facilitated distant organ colonization. The dynamic regulation of DSG2 by hypoxia 
      was key to this process, as down-regulation of DSG2 in hypoxic regions of primary 
      tumors led to elevated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) gene expression, 
      allowing cells to detach from the primary tumor and undergo intravasation. 
      Subsequent derepression of DSG2 after intravasation and release of hypoxic stress 
      was associated with an increased ability to colonize distant organs. This dynamic 
      regulation of DSG2 was mediated by Hypoxia-Induced Factor1α (HIF1α). In contrast 
      to its more widely observed function to promote expression of hypoxia-inducible 
      genes, HIF1α repressed DSG2 by recruitment of the polycomb repressive complex 2 
      components, EZH2 and SUZ12, to the DSG2 promoter in hypoxic cells. Consistent 
      with our experimental data, DSG2 expression level correlated with poor prognosis 
      and recurrence risk in breast cancer patients. Together, these results 
      demonstrated the importance of DSG2 expression in metastasis and revealed a 
      mechanism by which hypoxia drives metastasis.

TI  - Perspective on the increasing role of optical wearables and remote patient 
      monitoring in the COVID-19 era and beyond.
LID - 10.1117/1.JBO.25.10.102703 [doi]
LID - 102703
AB  - SIGNIFICANCE: The COVID-19 pandemic is changing the landscape of healthcare 
      delivery in many countries, with a new shift toward remote patient monitoring 
      (RPM). AIM: The goal of this perspective is to highlight the existing and future 
      role of wearable and RPM optical technologies in an increasingly at-home 
      healthcare and research environment. APPROACH: First, the specific changes 
      occurring during the COVID-19 pandemic in healthcare delivery, regulations, and 
      technological innovations related to RPM technologies are reviewed. Then, a 
      review of the current state and potential future impact of optical physiological 
      monitoring in portable and wearable formats is outlined. RESULTS: New efforts 
      from academia, industry, and regulatory agencies are advancing and encouraging 
      at-home, portable, and wearable physiological monitors as a growing part of 
      healthcare delivery. It is hoped that these shifts will assist with disease 
      diagnosis, treatment, management, recovery, and rehabilitation with minimal 
      in-person contact. Some of these trends are likely to persist for years to come. 
      Optical technologies already account for a large portion of RPM platforms, with a 
      good potential for future growth. CONCLUSIONS: The biomedical optics community 
      has a potentially large role to play in developing, testing, and commercializing 
      new wearable and RPM technologies to meet the changing healthcare and research 
      landscape in the COVID-19 era and beyond.

TI  - Digital Platform for Continuous Monitoring of Patients Using a Smartwatch: 
      Longitudinal Prospective Cohort Study.
PG  - e47388

LID - e47388
AB  - BACKGROUND: Since the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a boost in the digital 
      transformation of the human society, where wearable devices such as a smartwatch 
      can already measure vital signs in a continuous and naturalistic way; however, 
      the security and privacy of personal data is a challenge to expanding the use of 
      these data by health professionals in clinical follow-up for decision-making. 
      Similar to the European General Data Protection Regulation, in Brazil, the Lei 
      Geral de Proteção de Dados established rules and guidelines for the processing of 
      personal data, including those used for patient care, such as those captured by 
      smartwatches. Thus, in any telemonitoring scenario, there is a need to comply 
      with rules and regulations, making this issue a challenge to overcome. OBJECTIVE: 
      This study aimed to build a digital solution model for capturing data from 
      wearable devices and making them available in a safe and agile manner for 
      clinical and research use, following current laws. METHODS: A functional model 
      was built following the Brazilian Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados (2018), where 
      data captured by smartwatches can be transmitted anonymously over the Internet of 
      Things and be identified later within the hospital. A total of 80 volunteers were 
      selected for a 24-week follow-up clinical trial divided into 2 groups, one group 
      with a previous diagnosis of COVID-19 and a control group without a previous 
      diagnosis of COVID-19, to measure the synchronization rate of the platform with 
      the devices and the accuracy and precision of the smartwatch in out-of-hospital 
      conditions to simulate remote monitoring at home. RESULTS: In a 35-week clinical 
      trial, >11.2 million records were collected with no system downtime; 66% of 
      continuous beats per minute were synchronized within 24 hours (79% within 2 days 
      and 91% within a week). In the limit of agreement analysis, the mean differences 
      in oxygen saturation, diastolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure, and 
      heart rate were -1.280% (SD 5.679%), -1.399 (SD 19.112) mm Hg, -1.536 (SD 24.244) 
      mm Hg, and 0.566 (SD 3.114) beats per minute, respectively. Furthermore, there 
      was no difference in the 2 study groups in terms of data analysis (neither using 
      the smartwatch nor the gold-standard devices), but it is worth mentioning that 
      all volunteers in the COVID-19 group were already cured of the infection and were 
      highly functional in their daily work life. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the 
      results obtained, considering the validation conditions of accuracy and precision 
      and simulating an extrahospital use environment, the functional model built in 
      this study is capable of capturing data from the smartwatch and anonymously 
      providing it to health care services, where they can be treated according to the 
      legislation and be used to support clinical decisions during remote monitoring.

AB  - D-amino acids, the important components of the bacterial cell walls, are valuable 
      molecular and genetic markers of bacterial-derived organic material in the 
      environment. D-serine, a racemization product of L-serine is one such amino acid 
      present in various prokaryotes and eukaryotes. It is a well-recognized regulator 
      of various activities in the human nervous system. In plants, it has a role in 
      the nitrogen cycle regulation and pollen tube growth. Serine enantiomers are 
      present in different concentrations and few bacterial strains are reported to 
      contribute to D-serine in the environment. During the present study, soil samples 
      from different places in North India were collected and processed to isolate and 
      screen the bacteria on M9 minimal media (Himedia) for D-serine synthesis. 
      Thin-layer chromatography (TLC Silica gel 60 F 254 (20 × 20 cm, Merck, Darmstadt, 
      Germany) and Mass spectroscopic analysis (Bruker MICROTOF II spectrometer) 
      studies, etc were performed. D-serine-producing isolates were characterized as 
      per standard procedures. Bacterial isolate A1C1 with maximum D-serine 
      (0.919 ± 0.02 nM) synthesis under optimal growth conditions (37°C ± 0.5, 
      150 ± 0.5 RPM, and 7 ± 0.5 pH) was identified as Bacillus tequilensis based on 
      16sRNA sequencing. The isolate could be a valuable serine racemization tool for 
      various industrial and environmental applications.

TI  - IGF2BP3 promotes cell metastasis and is associated with poor patient survival in 
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
PG  - 410-421
LID - 10.1111/jcmm.17093 [doi]
AB  - Metastasis contributes to treatment failure in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) 
      patients. Our study aimed at elucidating the role of insulin-like growth factor 
      2 mRNA binding protein 3 (IGF2BP3) in NPC metastasis and the underlying mechanism 
      involved. IGF2BP3 expression in NPC was determined by bioinformatics, 
      quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry analyses. The 
      biological function of IGF2BP3 was investigated by using in vitro and in vivo 
      studies. In this study, IGF2BP3 mRNA and protein levels were elevated in NPC 
      tissues. In addition, IGF2BP3 exerted an oncogenic role by promoting 
      epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), thereby inducing NPC cell migration and 
      invasion. Further studies revealed that IGF2BP3 regulated the expression of key 
      regulators of EMT by activating AKT/mTOR signalling, thus stimulating NPC cell 
      migration and invasion. Remarkably, targeting IGF2BP3 delayed NPC metastasis 
      through attenuating p-AKT and vimentin expression and inducing E-cadherin 
      expression in vivo. Moreover, IGF2BP3 protein levels positively correlated with 
      distant metastasis after initial treatment. Importantly, IGF2BP3 expression 
      served as an independent prognostic factor in predicting the overall survival and 
      distant metastasis-free survival of NPC patients. This work identifies IGF2BP3 as 
      a novel prognostic marker and a new target for NPC treatment.

TI  - IoT-Based Heartbeat Rate-Monitoring Device Powered by Harvested Kinetic Energy.
LID - 10.3390/s24134249 [doi]
LID - 4249
AB  - Remote patient-monitoring systems are helpful since they can provide timely and 
      effective healthcare facilities. Such online telemedicine is usually achieved 
      with the help of sophisticated and advanced wearable sensor technologies. The 
      modern type of wearable connected devices enable the monitoring of vital sign 
      parameters such as: heart rate variability (HRV) also known as electrocardiogram 
      (ECG), blood pressure (BLP), Respiratory rate and body temperature, blood 
      pressure (BLP), respiratory rate, and body temperature. The ubiquitous problem of 
      wearable devices is their power demand for signal transmission; such devices 
      require frequent battery charging, which causes serious limitations to the 
      continuous monitoring of vital data. To overcome this, the current study provides 
      a primary report on collecting kinetic energy from daily human activities for 
      monitoring vital human signs. The harvested energy is used to sustain the battery 
      autonomy of wearable devices, which allows for a longer monitoring time of vital 
      data. This study proposes a novel type of stress- or exercise-monitoring ECG 
      device based on a microcontroller (PIC18F4550) and a Wi-Fi device (ESP8266), 
      which is cost-effective and enables real-time monitoring of heart rate in the 
      cloud during normal daily activities. In order to achieve both portability and 
      maximum power, the harvester has a small structure and low friction. Neodymium 
      magnets were chosen for their high magnetic strength, versatility, and compact 
      size. Due to the non-linear magnetic force interaction of the magnets, the 
      non-linear part of the dynamic equation has an inverse quadratic form. 
      Electromechanical damping is considered in this study, and the quadratic 
      non-linearity is approximated using MacLaurin expansion, which enables us to find 
      the law of motion for general case studies using classical methods for dynamic 
      equations and the suitable parameters for the harvester. The oscillations are 
      enabled by applying an initial force, and there is a loss of energy due to the 
      electromechanical damping. A typical numerical application is computed with 
      Matlab 2015 software, and an ODE45 solver is used to verify the accuracy of the 
      method.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) is the most common type of 
      thyroid tumor with a high recurrence rate. Here, we developed a nomogram to 
      effectively predict postoperative disease-free survival (DFS) in DTC patients. 
      METHODS: The mRNA expressions and clinical data of DTC patients were downloaded 
      from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) 
      database. Seventy percent of patients were randomly selected as the training 
      dataset, and thirty percent of patients were classified into the testing dataset. 
      Multivariate Cox regression analysis was adopted to establish a nomogram to 
      predict 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year DFS rate of DTC patients. RESULTS: A five-gene 
      signature comprised of TENM1, FN1, APOD, F12, and BTNL8 genes was established to 
      predict the DFS rate of DTC patients. Results from the concordance index 
      (C-index), area under curve (AUC), and calibration curve showed that both the 
      training dataset and the testing dataset exhibited good prediction ability, and 
      they were superior to other traditional models. The risk score and distant 
      metastasis (M) of the five-gene signature were independent risk factors that 
      affected DTC recurrence. A nomogram that could predict 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year 
      DFS rate of DTC patients was established with a C-index of 0.801 (95% CI: 0.736, 
      0.866). CONCLUSION: Our study developed a prediction model based on the gene 
      expression and clinical characteristics to predict the DFS rate of DTC patients, 
      which may be applied to more accurately assess patient prognosis and 
      individualized treatment.

TI  - Mechanical stress effects on transcriptional regulation of genes encoding 
      microtubule- and actin-associated proteins.
PG  - 17-30
LID - 10.1007/s12298-021-01123-x [doi]
AB  - Plant cytoskeleton regulation has been studied using a new approach based on both 
      (1) pharmacological analysis of tubulin and actin inhibitors and (2) mechanical 
      stimulation achieved by using a slow-rotating (2 rpm) clinostat in combination 
      with transcriptional analysis of genes encoding TUA6, ACT2, MAP65-1, CLASP, PLDδ, 
      FH4 and FH1 proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana seedling roots. The obtained data 
      suggest feedback between the organization of microtubule (MT) and actin filament 
      (AF) networks and the expression of the ACT2, TUA6, MAP65-1, CLASP and FH1/FH4 
      genes. Different regulation of feedback between MT/AF organization and TUA6, 
      ACT2, MAP65-1, CLASP, FH4 and FH1 gene expression was noted during slow 
      clinorotation, possibly due to altered mechanical impact on the cortical 
      cytoskeleton. For the first time, the expression of the tubulin-associated gene 
      MAP65-1 was shown to be dependent upon the organization of AFs. TUA6, MAP65-1, 
      CLASP, FH1 and FH4 likely participate in mechanical signal transduction. Our work 
      demonstrated that slow clinorotation is able to cause mechanical stress.

TI  - Attitudes of Patients With Chronic Heart Failure Toward Digital Device Data for 
      Self-documentation and Research in Germany: Cross-sectional Survey Study.
PG  - e34959
LID - 10.2196/34959 [doi]
LID - e34959
AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent years, the use of digital mobile measurement devices 
      (DMMDs) for self-documentation in cardiovascular care in Western industrialized 
      health care systems has increased. For patients with chronic heart failure (cHF), 
      digital self-documentation plays an increasingly important role in 
      self-management. Data from DMMDs can also be integrated into telemonitoring 
      programs or data-intensive medical research to collect and evaluate 
      patient-reported outcome measures through data sharing. However, the 
      implementation of data-intensive devices and data sharing poses several 
      challenges for doctors and patients as well as for the ethical governance of 
      data-driven medical research. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the potential 
      and challenges of digital device data in cardiology research from patients' 
      perspectives. Leading research questions of the study concerned the attitudes of 
      patients with cHF toward health-related data collected in the use of digital 
      devices for self-documentation as well as sharing these data and consenting to 
      data sharing for research purposes. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of patients 
      of a research in cardiology was conducted at a German university medical center 
      (N=159) in 2020 (March to July). Eligible participants were German-speaking adult 
      patients with cHF at that center. A pen-and-pencil questionnaire was sent by 
      mail. RESULTS: Most participants (77/105, 73.3%) approved digital documentation, 
      as they expected the device data to help them observe their body and its 
      functions more objectively. Digital device data were believed to provide 
      cognitive support, both for patients' self-assessment and doctors' evaluation of 
      their patients' current health condition. Interestingly, positive attitudes 
      toward DMMD data providing cognitive support were, in particular, voiced by older 
      patients aged >65 years. However, approximately half of the participants (56/105, 
      53.3%) also reported difficulty in dealing with self-documented data that lay 
      outside the optimal medical target range. Furthermore, our findings revealed 
      preferences for the self-management of DMMD data disclosed for data-intensive 
      medical research among German patients with cHF, which are best implemented with 
      a dynamic consent model. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide potentially valuable 
      insights for introducing DMMD in cardiovascular research in the German context. 
      They have several practical implications, such as a high divergence in attitudes 
      among patients with cHF toward different data-receiving organizations as well as 
      a large variance in preferences for the modes of receiving information included 
      in the consenting procedure for data sharing for research. We suggest addressing 
      patients' multiple views on consenting and data sharing in institutional 
      normative governance frameworks for data-intensive medical research.

TI  - A self-healing, recyclable and conductive gelatin/nanofibrillated 
      cellulose/Fe(3+) hydrogel based on multi-dynamic interactions for a 
      multifunctional strain sensor.
PG  - 1412-1421
LID - 10.1039/d2mh00028h [doi]
AB  - Conductive hydrogels have emerged as promising material candidates for 
      multifunctional strain sensors, attributed to their similarity to biological 
      tissues, good wearability, and high accuracy of information acquisition. However, 
      it is difficult to simultaneously manufacture conductive hydrogel-based 
      multifunctional strain sensors with the synergistic properties of reliable 
      healability for long-term usage and environmental degradability/recyclability for 
      decreasing the electronic waste. This work reports a facile strategy to engineer 
      a self-healing, recyclable and conductive strain sensor by virtue of 
      molecular-level multi-dynamic interactions (MMDIs) including Schiff base 
      complexes, hydrogen bonds, and coordination bonds, which were fabricated using a 
      dialdehyde TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl)-oxidized nanofibrillated 
      cellulose (DATNFC) pre-reinforced gelatin nanocomposite hydrogel (gelatin/DATNFC 
      hydrogel, GDH) followed by dipping in an Fe(3+) aqueous solution. The MMDI 
      strategy allows synchronous regulation of both bulk and interfacial interactions 
      to obtain exciting properties that outperform those of conventional hydrogels, 
      including extraordinary compressive stress (1310 kPa), intriguing self-healing 
      abilities, and remarkable electrical conductivity. With these outstanding merits, 
      the as-prepared gelatin/DATNFC/Fe(3+) hydrogel (GDIH) is developed to be a 
      multifunctional strain sensor with appealing strain sensitivity (GF = 2.24 under 
      6% strain) and compressive sensitivity (S = 1.14 kPa(-1) under 15 kPa), which can 
      be utilized to manufacture electronic skin and accurately discern subtle bodily 
      motions, handwriting and personal signatures. Notably, this GDIH-based sensor 
      also exhibited reliable self-healing properties for long-term usage, 
      environmental degradability and complete recyclability for decreasing the 
      electronic waste. In consideration of the extremely facile preparation process, 
      biocompatibility, satisfactory functionalities, remarkable self-healing 
      properties and recyclability, the emergence of the GDIH-based sensor is believed 
      to propose a new strategy for the development of sustainable-multifunctional 
      strain sensors and healthcare monitoring.

      COVID-19, the panelists also discussed the COVID-19 pandemic in general. The 
      meeting generated many novel ideas for collaboration between experts in medicine, 
      science, government, and industry to develop new technologies and disease 
      treatment paradigms to fight this global pandemic.

AB  - Conductive hydrogels, exhibiting wide applications in electronic skins and soft 
      wearable sensors, often require maturely regulating of the hydrogel mechanical 
      properties to meet specific demands and work for a long-term or under extreme 
      environment. However, in situ regulation of the mechanical properties of 
      hydrogels is still a challenge, and regular conductive hydrogels will inevitably 
      freeze at subzero temperature and easily dehydrate, which leads to a short 
      service life. Herein, a novel adhesive hydrogel (PAA-Dopa-Zr(4+)) capable of 
      strain sensing is proposed with antifreezing, nondrying, strong surface adhesion, 
      and tunable mechanical properties. 3,4-Dihydroxyphenyl-l-alanine (l-Dopa)-grafted 
      poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and Zr(4+) ion are introduced into the hydrogel, which 
      broadly alters the mechanical properties via tuning the in situ aggregation state 
      of polymer chains by ions based on the complexation effect. The catechol groups 
      of l-Dopa and viscous glucose endow the hydrogel with high adhesiveness for skin 
      and device interface (including humid and dry environments) and exhibit an 
      outstanding temperature tolerance under extreme wide temperature spectrum (-35 to 
      65 °C) or long-lasting moisture retention (60 days). Furthermore, this 
      PAA-Dopa-Zr(4+) can be assembled as a flexible strain-sensitive sensor to detect 
      human motions based on specific mechanical properties requirements. This work, 
      enabling superior adhesive and temperature tolerance performance and broad 
      mechanical tenability, presents a new paradigm for numerous applications to 
      wearable sensing and personalized healthcare monitoring.

TI  - Using Medical Device Standards for Design and Risk Management of Immersive 
      Virtual Reality for At-Home Therapy and Remote Patient Monitoring.
PG  - e26942
LID - 10.2196/26942 [doi]
LID - e26942
AB  - Numerous virtual reality (VR) systems have received regulatory clearance as 
      therapeutic medical devices for in-clinic and at-home use. These systems enable 
      remote patient monitoring of clinician-prescribed rehabilitation exercises, 
      although most of these systems are nonimmersive. With the expanding availability 
      of affordable and easy-to-use head-mounted display (HMD)-based VR, there is 
      growing interest in immersive VR therapies. However, HMD-based VR presents unique 
      risks. Following standards for medical device development, the objective of this 
      paper is to demonstrate a risk management process for a generic immersive VR 
      system for remote patient monitoring of at-home therapy. Regulations, standards, 
      and guidance documents applicable to therapeutic VR design are reviewed to 
      provide necessary background. Generic requirements for an immersive VR system for 
      home use and remote patient monitoring are identified using predicate analysis 
      and specified for both patients and clinicians using user stories. To analyze 
      risk, failure modes and effects analysis, adapted for medical device risk 
      management, is performed on the generic user stories and a set of risk control 
      measures is proposed. Many therapeutic applications of VR would be regulated as a 
      medical device if they were to be commercially marketed. Understanding relevant 
      standards for design and risk management early in the development process can 
      help expedite the availability of innovative VR therapies that are safe and 
      effective.

TI  - "An excellent servant but a terrible master": Understanding the value of 
      wearables for self-management in people with cystic fibrosis and their healthcare 
      providers - A qualitative study.

LID - S1386-5056(24)00195-3 [pii]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Wearables hold potential to improve chronic disease self-management 
      in conditions like cystic fibrosis (CF) through remote monitoring, early 
      detection of illness and motivation. Little is known about the acceptability and 
      sustainability of integrating wearables into routine care from the perspectives 
      of people with CF (pwCF) and their treating clinicians. METHODS: A 
      cross-sectional qualitative study involving semi-structured interviews with adult 
      pwCF and focus groups comprising members of a CF multidisciplinary team (MDT) 
      were conducted at a specialist CF centre in Australia. A phenomenological 
      orientation underpinned the study. Inductive thematic analysis was performed 
      using the Framework method. The study adhered to the Consolidated Criteria for 
      Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) checklist. RESULTS: Nine pwCF and eight 
      members of a CF MDT, representing six clinical disciplines, participated in the 
      study. Eight themes were inductively generated from the data, of which four were 
      identified from each group. PwCF valued wearables for providing real-time data to 
      motivate healthy behaviours and support shared goal-setting with healthcare 
      providers. Wearables did not influence adherence to CF-specific self-management 
      practices and had some hardware limitations. Members of the CF MDT recognised 
      potential benefits of remote monitoring and shared goal-setting, but advised 
      caution regarding data accuracy, generating patient anxiety in certain 
      personality traits, and lack of evidence supporting use in CF self-management. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Perspectives on integrating wearables into CF care were cautiously 
      optimistic, with emerging risks related to patient anxiety and lack of evidence 
      moderating acceptance.

TI  - Sensitive, Robust, Wide-Range, and High-Consistency Capacitive Tactile Sensors 
      with Ordered Porous Dielectric Microstructures.
PG  - 7384-7398
LID - 10.1021/acsami.3c15368 [doi]
AB  - Flexible capacitive tactile sensors show great promise in personalized healthcare 
      monitoring and human-machine interfaces, but their practical application is 
      normally hindered because they rarely possess the required comprehensive 
      performance, that is, high pressure sensitivity and fast response within a broad 
      pressure range, high structure robustness, performance consistency, etc. This 
      paper aims to engineer flexible capacitive pressure sensors with highly ordered 
      porous dielectric microstructures and a 3D-printing-based fully 
      solution-processable fabrication process. The proposed dielectric layer with 
      uniformly distributed interior microporous can not only increase its 
      compressibility and dynamic response within an extended pressure range but also 
      enlarge its contact area with electrodes, contributing to a simultaneous 
      improvement in the sensitivity, response speed, detection range, and structure 
      robustness. Meanwhile, owing to its superior abilities in complex structure 
      manufacturing and dimension controlling, the proposed 3D-printing-based 
      fabrication process enables the consistent fabrication of the porous 
      microstructure and thus guarantees device consistency. As a result, the prepared 
      pressure sensors exhibit a high sensitivity of 0.21 kPa(-1), fast response and 
      relaxation times of 112 and 152 ms, an interface bonding strength of more than 
      455.2 kPa, and excellent performance consistency (≤5.47% deviation among 
      different batches of sensors) and tunability. Encouraged by this, the pressure 
      sensor is further integrated with a wireless readout circuit and realizes 
      wireless wearable monitoring of various biosignals (pulse waves and heart rate) 
      and body movements (from slight finger touch to large knee bending). Finally, the 
      influence law of the feature parameters of the porous microstructure on device 
      performance is established by the finite element method, paving the way for 
      sensor optimization. This study motivates the development of flexible capacitive 
      pressure sensors toward practical application.

TI  - A Potentially Practicable Halotolerant Yeast Meyerozyma guilliermondii A4 for 
      Decolorizing and Detoxifying Azo Dyes and Its Possible Halotolerance Mechanisms.
LID - 10.3390/jof9080851 [doi]
LID - 851
AB  - In this study, a halotolerant yeast that is capable of efficiently decolorizing 
      and detoxifying azo dyes was isolated, identified and characterized for coping 
      with the treatment of azo-dye-containing wastewaters. A characterization of the 
      yeast, including the optimization of its metabolism and growth conditions, its 
      detoxification effectiveness and the degradation pathway of the target azo dye, 
      as well as a determination of the key activities of the enzyme, was performed. 
      Finally, the possible halotolerance mechanisms of the yeast were proposed through 
      a comparative transcriptome analysis. The results show that a halotolerant yeast, 
      A4, which could decolorize various azo dyes, was isolated from a marine 
      environment and was identified as Meyerozyma guilliermondii. Its optimal 
      conditions for dye decolorization were ≥1.0 g/L of sucrose, ≥0.2 g/L of 
      (NH(4))(2)SO(4), 0.06 g/L of yeast extract, pH 6.0, a temperature of 35 °C and a 
      rotation speed of ≥160 rpm. The yeast, A4, degraded and detoxified ARB through a 
      series of steps, relying on the key enzymes that might be involved in the 
      degradation of azo dye and aromatic compounds. The halotolerance of the yeast, 
      A4, was mainly related to the regulation of the cell wall components and the 
      excessive uptake of Na(+)/K(+) and/or compatible organic solutes into the cells 
      under different salinity conditions. The up-regulation of genes encoding 
      Ca(2+)-ATPase and casein kinase II as well as the enrichment of KEGG pathways 
      associated with proteasome and ribosome might also be responsible for its 
      halotolerance.

TI  - Anti-proliferation effects of Apatinib in combination with Curcumin in breast 
      cancer cells.
PG  - 27-32
LID - 10.1515/hmbci-2022-0036 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Despite remarkable development of new therapeutic strategies to 
      improve survival rates and treatment of patients with cancer, there are still 
      many limitations in management of patients with distant metastasis breast cancer. 
      Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate a novel method to enhance 
      therapeutic efficacy of Apatinib (as a chemotherapeutic agent) by 
      co-administration of Curcumin (as a bioactive herbal compound) in breast cancer 
      treatment. METHODS: Effects of Apatinib, Curcumin, and their combinations 
      (Apa-Cur) was evaluated on viability and proliferation of breast cell line (MCF7) 
      by MTT assay. Moreover, effects of Apatinib, Curcumin, and Apa-Cur was 
      investigated on apoptosis rate in the cancer cells. Expression levels of 
      apoptosis-related genes (BAX, SMAC, BCL2, and SURVIVIN) in treated cancer cells 
      and untreated controls were evaluated using the Real-Time PCR method. RESULTS: 
      The obtained results showed that all treatments of Apatinib, Curcumin, and 
      Apa-Cur significantly decreased viability and proliferation of the breast cancer 
      cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. However, anti-proliferation 
      activity of Apa-Cur combination was significantly higher than Apatinib and 
      Curcumin treatment alone. In addition, Apatinib, Curcumin, and Apa-Cur increased 
      apoptosis percentage in the treated cancer cells through regulation of 
      apoptosis-related genes expression. CONCLUSIONS: In general, Apa-Cur combination 
      therapy exerts more profound anti-proliferation effects on breast cancer cell 
      than Apatinib or Curcumin monotherapy. However, further studies are required to 
      identify other possible signaling pathways and mechanisms involved in the 
      anticancer effects of Apatinib, Curcumin, and Apa-Cur.

TI  - Spontaneous metastasis xenograft models link CD44 isoform 4 to angiogenesis, 
      hypoxia, EMT and mitochondria-related pathways in colorectal cancer.
PG  - 62-90
LID - 10.1002/1878-0261.13535 [doi]
AB  - Hematogenous metastasis limits the survival of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. 
      Here, we illuminated the roles of CD44 isoforms in this process. Isoforms 3 and 4 
      were predominantly expressed in CRC patients. CD44 isoform 4 indicated poor 
      outcome and correlated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and decreased 
      oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) in patients; opposite associations were found 
      for isoform 3. Pan-CD44 knockdown (kd) independently impaired primary tumor 
      formation and abrogated distant metastasis in CRC xenografts. The xenograft 
      tumors mainly expressed the clinically relevant CD44 isoforms 3 and 4. Both 
      isoforms were enhanced in the paranecrotic, hypoxic tumor regions but were 
      generally absent in lung metastases. Upon CD44 kd, tumor angiogenesis was 
      increased in the paranecrotic areas, accompanied by reduced hypoxia-inducible 
      factor-1α and CEACAM5 but increased E-cadherin expression. Mitochondrial genes 
      and proteins were induced upon pan-CD44 kd, as were OxPhos genes. Hypoxia 
      increased VEGF release from tumor spheres, particularly upon CD44 kd. Genes 
      affected upon CD44 kd in xenografts specifically overlapped concordantly with 
      genes correlating with CD44 isoform 4 (but not isoform 3) in patients, validating 
      the clinical relevance of the used model and highlighting the 
      metastasis-promoting role of CD44 isoform 4.

TI  - Multifractal Multiscale Analysis of Human Movements during Cognitive Tasks.
LID - 10.3390/e26020148 [doi]
LID - 148
AB  - Continuous adaptations of the movement system to changing environments or task 
      demands rely on superposed fractal processes exhibiting power laws, that is, 
      multifractality. The estimators of the multifractal spectrum potentially reflect 
      the adaptive use of perception, cognition, and action. To observe time-specific 
      behavior in multifractal dynamics, a multiscale multifractal analysis based on 
      DFA (MFMS-DFA) has been recently proposed and applied to cardiovascular dynamics. 
      Here we aimed at evaluating whether MFMS-DFA allows identifying multiscale 
      structures in the dynamics of human movements. Thirty-six (12 females) 
      participants pedaled freely, after a metronomic initiation of the cadence at 60 
      rpm, against a light workload for 10 min: in reference to cycling (C), cycling 
      while playing "Tetris" on a computer, alone (CT) or collaboratively (CTC) with 
      another pedaling participant. Pedal revolution periods (PRP) series were examined 
      with MFMS-DFA and compared to linearized surrogates, which attested to a presence 
      of multifractality at almost all scales. A marked alteration in multifractality 
      when playing Tetris was evidenced at two scales, τ ≈ 16 and τ ≈ 64 s, yet less 
      marked at τ ≈ 16 s when playing collaboratively. Playing Tetris in collaboration 
      attenuated these alterations, especially in the best Tetris players. This 
      observation suggests the high sensitivity to cognitive demand of MFMS-DFA 
      estimators, extending to the assessment of skill/demand interplay from individual 
      behavior. So, by identifying scale-dependent multifractal structures in movement 
      dynamics, MFMS-DFA has obvious potential for examining brain-movement 
      coordinative structures, likely with sufficient sensitivity to find echo in 
      diagnosing disorders and monitoring the progress of diseases that affect 
      cognition and movement control.

AB  - Purpose: To characterize the role of fibrous sheath interacting protein 2 (FSIP2) 
      in the survival outcomes and prognosis of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) 
      patients, which is currently not well understood. Methods: The Oncomine and CCLE 
      databases were used to investigate the differential expression of FSIP2 in ccRCC 
      versus other cancer types. Levels of FSIP2 in 85 ccRCC patients were assessed by 
      immunohistochemical analysis; clinicopathological features related to FSIP2 
      expression were examined in these patients finally, disease-free survival and 
      overall survival were estimated by survival analysis to elucidate the impact of 
      FSIP2 expression in ccRCC patients. Results: Analysis using the Oncomine database 
      revealed significant upregulation of the FSIP2 gene in papillary RCC, compared to 
      that in normal tissues. Additionally, FSIP2 expression was found to be 
      significantly associated with abnormal platelet count, positive distant 
      metastasis, and death as the incidence of distant metastasis and death were 
      higher in patients with FSIP2 expression compared to those without FSIP2 
      expression. Survival analysis revealed that FSIP2 expression was significantly 
      related to shorter disease-free survival and overall survival. Meanwhile, 
      patients with FSIP2 expression had worse prognosis than those without FSIP2 
      expression. Conclusions: FSIP2 expression is associated with poor survival 
      outcomes and poor prognosis in ccRCC patients. FSIP2 may therefore serve as a 
      potential predictive biomarker of ccRCC prognosis.

AB  - The present study involved the isolation of two cadmium (Cd) and chromium (Cr) 
      resistant strains, identified as Staphylococcus cohnii L1-N1 and Bacillus cereus 
      CKN12, from heavy metal contaminated soils. S. cohnii L1-N1 exhibited a reduction 
      of 24.4 % in Cr(6+) and an adsorption rate of 6.43 % for Cd over a period of 
      5 days. These results were achieved under optimal conditions of pH (7.0), 
      temperature (35 °C), shaking speed (200 rpm), and inoculum volume (8 %). B. 
      cereus strain CKN12 exhibited complete reduction of Cr(6+) within a span of 48 h, 
      while it demonstrated a 57.3 % adsorption capacity for Cd over a period of 120 h. 
      These results were achieved under conditions of optimal pH (8.0), temperature 
      (40 °C), shaking speed (150 rpm), and inoculum volume (2-3 %). Additionally, 
      microcharacterization and ICP-MS analysis revealed that Cr and Cd were 
      accumulated on the cell surface, whereas Cr(6+) was mainly reduced 
      extracellularly. Subsequently, a series of pot experiments were conducted to 
      provide evidence that the inclusion of S. cohnii L1-N1 or B. cereus CKN12 into 
      the system resulted in a notable enhancement in both the plant height and biomass 
      of king grass. In particular, it was observed that the presence of S. cohnii 
      L1-N1 or B. cereus CKN12 in king grass led to a significant reduction in the 
      levels of Cd and Cr in the soils (36.0 % and 27.8 %, or 72.9 % and 47.4 %, 
      respectively). Thus, the results of this study indicate that the combined use of 
      two bacterial strains can effectively aid in the remediation of tropical soils 
      contaminated with moderate to light levels of Cd and Cr.

AB  - Both sulfonamides (SAs) and copper (Cu(II)) were frequently detected together in 
      swine wastewater. In this study, the regulation of Cu(II) on SAs adsorption and 
      release of dissolved organic matters (DOMs) by fungi-microalgae pellets 
      (FM-pellets) were investigated. Aspergillus oryzae pellets were prepared for 
      combination with Chlorella vulgaris and the optimal conditions were at agitation 
      speed of 130 rpm, fungi to microalgae ratio of 10:1 and the combined time of 3 h 
      with the highest combination efficiency of 98.65%. The results showed that 
      adsorption was the main mechanism for SAs removal. FM-pellets exhibited a high 
      SAs adsorption potential within 6 h, and the adsorption capacity of 
      sulfamethazine (SMZ), sulfamonomethoxine (SMM) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) was 
      1.07, 0.94 and 1.67 mg/g, respectively. Furthermore, the removal of SMX, SMZ and 
      SMM was greatly promoted from 62.31% to 85.21%, 58.71-67.91% and 64.17-80.31%, 
      respectively, under the presence of 2 mg/L Cu(II) through ion exchange and 
      adsorption bridging. DOMs were analyzed by the parallel factor (PARAFAC) to 
      demonstrate the response mechanism of FM-pellets to Cu(II). Protein-like 
      substances and NADH in DOMs released by FM-pellets formed complexes with Cu(II) 
      to alleviate the damage on the organism. These findings provide new insights into 
      the mechanism and response of Cu(II) in the removal of SAs by FM-pellets.

AB  - The prognostic value of microRNA-140-5p (miR-140-5p) expression in cancer 
      patients has been investigated, but with inconsistent results. This meta-analysis 
      aims to determine the prognostic significance of miR-140-5p expression in 
      patients with various malignancies. A comprehensive literature search was 
      conducted using PubMed, Web of Science, ProQuest, Cochrane, and Google Scholar to 
      identify relevant studies published before June 2023. Pooled hazard ratios (HR) 
      and odds ratios (OR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to 
      assess the prognostic importance and clinicopathological features of miR-140-5p 
      in overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) of cancer patients, 
      respectively. The CancerMIRNome database and other OS analysis webservers were 
      utilized to explore the prognostic value and expression profile of miR-140-5p. A 
      total of 17 studies were included in the final analysis. The results demonstrated 
      that decreased miR-140-5p expression was significantly associated with inferior 
      OS (pooled HR 0.63; 95 % CI, 0.51-0.79; p < 0.001) and DFS (pooled HR 0.40; 95 % 
      CI, 0.25-0.64; p < 0.001). Pooled ORs indicated a significant correlation between 
      reduced miR-140-5p expression and positive lymph node metastasis (LNM; OR = 3.42; 
      95 % CI, 2.36-4.94; p < 0.001), advanced tumor stage (OR = 2.80; 95 % CI, 
      2.07-3.78; p < 0.001), and positive distant metastasis (DM; OR = 10.81; 95 % CI, 
      3.31-35.30; p < 0.001). No significant associations were observed between 
      miR-140-5p expression and gender (OR = 0.94; 95 % CI, 0.70-1.28; p = 0.70), age 
      (OR = 1.31; 95 % CI, 0.99-1.74; p = 0.06), tumor size (OR = 1.55; 95 % CI, 
      0.77-3.10; p = 0.22), and histological grade (OR = 1.20; 95 % CI, 0.46-3.10; p = 
      0.71). Subgroup analyses revealed that decreased miR-140-5p expression was 
      associated with shorter OS in subgroups based on sample size (<100 or >100), 
      tumor origin (GI or non-GI), and cancer type (GC/CRC). Bioinformatic analysis 
      supported the finding that miR-140-5p was downregulated in most tumor tissues, 
      and its reduced expression was linked to poor prognosis in patients with multiple 
      malignancies. The prognostic significance of miR-140-5p in predicting reduced OS 
      and DFS suggests that measuring miR-140-5p expression levels before treatment 
      could serve as a valuable biomarker for identifying cancer patients with an 
      unfavorable prognosis and improving clinical management.

TI  - FOXM1 is required for small cell lung cancer tumorigenesis and associated with 
      poor clinical prognosis.

AB  - Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) continues to cause poor clinical outcomes due to 
      limited advances in sustained treatments for rapid cancer cell proliferation and 
      progression. The transcriptional factor Forkhead Box M1 (FOXM1) regulates cell 
      proliferation, tumor initiation, and progression in multiple cancer types. 
      However, its biological function and clinical significance in SCLC remain 
      unestablished. Analysis of the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia and SCLC datasets in 
      the present study disclosed significant upregulation of FOXM1 mRNA in SCLC cell 
      lines and tissues. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that FOXM1 is 
      positively correlated with pathways regulating cell proliferation and DNA damage 
      repair, as evident from sensitization of FOXM1-depleted SCLC cells to 
      chemotherapy. Furthermore, Foxm1 knockout inhibited SCLC formation in the 
      Rb1(fl/fl)Trp53(fl/fl)Myc(LSL/LSL) (RPM) mouse model associated with increased 
      levels of neuroendocrine markers, Ascl1 and Cgrp, and decrease in Yap1. 
      Consistently, FOXM1 depletion in NCI-H1688 SCLC cells reduced migration and 
      enhanced apoptosis and sensitivity to cisplatin and etoposide. SCLC with high 
      FOXM1 expression (N = 30, 57.7%) was significantly correlated with advanced 
      clinical stage, extrathoracic metastases, and decrease in overall survival (OS), 
      compared with the low-FOXM1 group (7.90 vs. 12.46 months). Moreover, the 
      high-FOXM1 group showed shorter progression-free survival after standard 
      chemotherapy, compared with the low-FOXM1 group (3.90 vs. 8.69 months). Our 
      collective findings support the utility of FOXM1 as a prognostic biomarker and 
      potential molecular target for SCLC.

TI  - Biodesulfurization of refractory sulfur compounds in petro-diesel by a novel 
      hydrocarbon tolerable strain Paenibacillus glucanolyticus HN4.
PG  - 8102-8116
LID - 10.1007/s11356-020-11090-7 [doi]
AB  - One of the main precursors of air pollution and acid rains is the presence of the 
      recalcitrant thiophenic compounds, for example dibenzothiophene (DBT) and its 
      derivatives in transportation fuels. In an attempt to achieve the worldwide 
      regulations of ultra-low sulfur transportation fuels without affecting its 
      hydrocarbon skeleton, a biphasic medium containing 100 mg/L DBT dissolved in 
      n-hexadecane (1/4 oil/water v/v) used for enrichment and isolation of selective 
      biodesulfurizing bacterium from an oil-polluted sediment sample collected from 
      Egyptian Red Sea shoreline. The isolated bacterium is facultative anaerobe, 
      motile, spore-former, and mesophile. It is genetically identified as 
      Paenibacillus glucanolyticus strain HN4 (NCBI Gene Bank Accession No. MT645230). 
      HN4 desulfurized DBT as a model of the recalcitrant thiophenic compounds without 
      affecting its hydrocarbon skeleton via the 4S-pathway producing 2-hydroxybiphenyl 
      (2-HBP) as a dead end product. HN4 substantiated to be a hydrocarbon tolerant, 
      biosurfactants(s) producer, and endorsed unique enzymatic system capable of 
      desulfurizing broad range of thiophenic compounds and expressed an efficient 
      desulfurization activity against the recalcitrant alkylated DBTs. As far our 
      knowledge, it is the first reported BDS study using P. glucanolyticus. 
      Statistical optimization based on One-Factor-At-A-Time (OFAT) technique and 
      response surface methodology (RSM) applied for elucidation of mathematical model 
      correlations describing and optimizing the effect of different physicochemical 
      parameters on batch biphasic BDS process. That illustrated an approximate 
      increase in BDS efficiency by 1.34 fold and recorded 94% sulfur removal in 
      biphasic batch process at optimum operation conditions of 120 h, 0.14 wt% 
      S-content model oil (DBT dissolved in n-hexadecane), 33.5 °C, pH7 and 1/1 
      oil/water phase ratio, and 147 rpm. Resting cells of HN4 in a biphasic reactor 
      (1/1 v/v) decreased the sulfur content of a refractory thiophenic model oil 
      (thiophene, benzothiophene, DBT, and alkylated DBT dissolved in n-hexadecane) 
      from 0.14 to 0.027 wt%, and petro-diesel from 0.2 to 0.04 wt%, within 120 h, 
      keeping the calorific value of the treated fuel intact. Consequently, that novel 
      strain could be recommended as a promising candidate for BDS as complementary to 
      hydrodesulfurization process in oil refinery.

AB  - A high-yielding microbial polysaccharide-producing strain, named RM1603, was 
      isolated from rhizosphere soil and identified by morphological and phylogenetic 
      analysis. The extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) were identified by thin-layer 
      chromatography and infrared spectroscopy. The fermentation conditions were 
      optimized by single factor experiments in shake flasks and a 5-L fermentor. The 
      results of morphological and phylogenetic tree analysis showed that RM1603 was a 
      strain of Aureobasidium pullulans. Its microbial polysaccharide was identified as 
      pullulan, and the EPS production capacity reached 33.07 ± 1.03 g L(-1) in shake 
      flasks. The fermentation conditions were optimized in a 5-L fermentor, and were 
      found to encompass an initial pH of 6.5, aeration rate of 2 vvm, rotor speed of 
      600 rpm, and inoculum size of 2 %. Under these conditions, the pullulan yield of 
      RM1603 reached 62.52 ± 0.24 g L(-1). Thus, this study contributes RM1603 as a new 
      isolation with high-yielding pullulan and potential application value in 
      biotechnology.

TI  - A prospective multicenter feasibility study of a miniaturized implantable 
      continuous flow ventricular assist device in smaller children with heart failure.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is no FDA-approved left ventricular assist device (LVAD) for 
      smaller children permitting routine hospital discharge. Smaller children 
      supported with LVADs typically remain hospitalized for months awaiting heart 
      transplant-a major burden for families and a challenge for hospitals. We describe 
      the initial outcomes of the Jarvik 2015, a miniaturized implantable continuous 
      flow LVAD, in the NHLBI-funded Pumps for Kids, Infants, and Neonates (PumpKIN) 
      study, for bridge-to-heart transplant. METHODS: Children weighing 8 to 30 kg with 
      severe systolic heart failure and failing optimal medical therapy were recruited 
      at 7 centers in the United States. Patients with severe right heart failure and 
      single-ventricle congenital heart disease were excluded. The primary feasibility 
      endpoint was survival to 30 days without severe stroke or non-operational device 
      failure. RESULTS: Of 7 children implanted, the median age was 2.2 (range 0.7, 
      7.1) years, median weight 10 (8.2 to 20.7) kilograms; 86% had dilated 
      cardiomyopathy; 29% were INTERMACS profile 1. The median duration of Jarvik 2015 
      support was 149 (range 5 to 188) days where all 7 children survived including 5 
      to heart transplant, 1 to recovery, and 1 to conversion to a paracorporeal 
      device. One patient experienced an ischemic stroke on day 53 of device support in 
      the setting of myocardial recovery. One patient required ECMO support for 
      intractable ventricular arrhythmias and was eventually transplanted from 
      paracorporeal biventricular VAD support. The median pump speed was 1600 RPM with 
      power ranging from 1-4 Watts. The median plasma free hemoglobin was 19, 30, 19 
      and 30 mg/dL at 7, 30, 90 and 180 days or time of explant, respectively. All 
      patients reached the primary feasibility endpoint. Patient-reported outcomes with 
      the device were favorable with respect to participation in a full range of 
      activities. Due to financial issues with the manufacturer, the study was 
      suspended after consent of the eighth patient. CONCLUSION: The Jarvik 2015 LVAD 
      appears to hold important promise as an implantable continuous flow device for 
      smaller children that may support hospital discharge. The FDA has approved the 
      device to proceed to a 22-subject pivotal trial. Whether this device will survive 
      to commercialization remains unclear because of the financial challenges faced by 
      industry seeking to develop pediatric medical devices. (Supported by NIH/NHLBI

AB  - Menaquinone-7 (MK-7) is an important kind of vitamin K2 which plays significant 
      roles in the treatment of coagulation and osteoporosis, and prevention of 
      cardiovascular disease. This work was purposed to study the differences of gene 
      expression at different oxygen supply conditions in Bacillus natto. The 
      differences of fermentation characteristics, gene expression related to MK-7 
      biosynthesis, spore and biofilm formation were analyzed. The yield of MK-7 
      increased by two fold under high oxygen supply condition of 200 rpm. Further 
      transcriptome analysis indicated that most of the enzymes in MK-7 biosynthesis 
      pathway were also up-regulated. Moreover, glycerol kinase, fructose-bisphosphate 
      aldolase and phosphofructokinase in glycolysis pathway were all up-regulated 
      indicating that high oxygen supply can increase the consumption of substrate 
      glycerol. Meanwhile, menD, encoded the rate-limiting enzyme in the MK pathway, 
      was obviously up-regulated by 3.49-fold while most of the enzymes related to 
      spore formation were down regulated at 200 rpm. Besides, superoxide dismutase 
      (SOD2), catalase (CAT), hydroperoxide reductase (AhpF) and DNA-binding protein 
      MrgA in the antioxidant defense system were up-regulated, while superoxide 
      dismutase (SOD1) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were down-regulated. These 
      results could contribute to a better understanding for the effect of oxygen on 
      the MK-7 production in Bacillus natto, and further analyze the molecular 
      regulation mechanism of MK-7 biosynthesis.

TI  - Dynamic changes in the expression pattern of miRNAs and associated target genes 
      during coconut somatic embryogenesis.
PG  - 79
LID - 10.1007/s00425-020-03368-4 [doi]
AB  - Genome-wide analysis of small RNAs identifies somatic embryogenesis- specific 
      miRNAs and their targets and provides novel insights into the mechanisms 
      governing somatic embryogenesis in coconut, a highly in vitro recalcitrant 
      species. Coconut, a major plantation crop of the tropics is recalcitrant to in 
      vitro culture with a very low rate of somatic embryo turnover. Clonal propagation 
      to enhance the production of high yielding, disease-free planting material in 
      coconut has remained a distant reality. To better understand the molecular basis 
      of this recalcitrance and to throw light on the complex regulatory network 
      involved in the transition of coconut somatic cells to embryogenic calli, 
      genome-wide profiling of small RNAs from embryogenic (EC) and non-embryogenic 
      calli (NEC) was undertaken using Illumina Hiseq 2000 platform. We have identified 
      a total of 110 conserved miRNAs (representing 46 known miRNA families) in both 
      types of calli. In addition, 97 novel miRNAs (48 specific to EC, 21 specific to 
      NEC and 28 common to both the libraries) were also identified. Among the 
      conserved miRNAs, 10 were found to be differentially expressed between NEC and EC 
      libraries with a log2 fold change > 2 following RPM-based normalization. miR156f, 
      miR167c, miR169a, miR319a, miR535a, and miR5179 are upregulated and miR160a, 
      miR166a, miR171a, and miR319b are down-regulated in NEC. To confirm the 
      differential expression pattern and their regulatory role in SE, the expression 
      patterns of miRNAs and their putative targets were analyzed using qRT- PCR and 
      most of the analyzed miRNA-target pairs showed inverse correlation during somatic 
      embryogenesis. Selected targets were further validated by RNA ligase mediated 
      rapid amplification of 5' cDNA ends (5'RLM-RACE). Our data suggest that a few 
      conserved miRNAs and species-specific miRNAs act in concert to regulate the 
      process of somatic embryogenesis in coconut. The results of this study provide 
      the first overview into the regulatory landscape of somatic embryogenesis in 
      coconut and possible strategies for fine-tuning or reprogramming to enhance 
      somatic embryo turn over in coconut.

AB  - Sugar alcohols are the prominent alternatives of sugars in food, medical, and 
      health industries. The ruthenium supported on multiwalled carbon nanotubes 
      (Ru/MWCNTs) catalysts were prepared based on the Ru valence regulation strategy 
      and applied for selective sugar hydrogenation to prepare various sugar alcohols 
      including xylitol, arabinitol, sorbitol, mannitol, and galactitol for the first 
      time, with high selectivity (>99.0%) and yield (>98.0%) under mild conditions 
      (≤110 °C, 3.0 MPa H(2) pressure). The hydrogenation reaction of xylose was 
      further optimized and under mild conditions (100 °C, 3.0 MPa H(2) pressure, and 
      500 rpm), which were lower than ever reported for high efficient synthesis of 
      xylitol, 99.8% xylose conversion and 99.0% xylitol yield were achieved after 120 
      min of reaction.
