AB  - Heart failure (HF) is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. The 
      increasing prevalence of HF and inpatient HF hospitalization has a considerable 
      burden on healthcare cost and utilization. The recognition that hemodynamic 
      changes in pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and left atrial pressure precede the 
      signs and symptoms of HF has led to interest in hemodynamic guided HF therapy as 
      an approach to allow earlier intervention during a heart failure decompensation. 
      Remote patient monitoring (RPM) utilizing telecommunication, cardiac implantable 
      electronic device parameters and implantable hemodynamic monitors (IHM) have 
      largely failed to demonstrate favorable outcomes in multicenter trials. However, 
      one positive randomized clinical trial testing the CardioMEMS device (followed by 
      Food and Drug Administration approval) has generated renewed interest in PAP 
      monitoring in the HF population to decrease hospitalization and improve quality 
      of life. The COVID-19 pandemic has also stirred a resurgence in the utilization 
      of telehealth to which RPM using IHM may be complementary. The cost effectiveness 
      of these monitors continues to be a matter of debate. Future iterations of 
      devices aim to be smaller, less burdensome for the patient, less dependent on 
      patient compliance, and less cumbersome for health care providers with the 
      integration of artificial intelligence coupled with sophisticated data management 
      and interpretation tools. Currently, use of IHM may be considered in advanced 
      heart failure patients with the support of structured programs.

AB  - Navigating contemporary healthcare, wearable technology and smartphones are 
      marking the dawn of a transformative era in patient observation and personalised 
      care. Wearables, equipped with various sensing technologies (e.g., accelerometer 
      for movement, optics for heart rate), are increasingly being recognised for their 
      expansive potential in (remote) patient monitoring, diagnostics, and therapeutic 
      applications which suggests a plausible move towards a more decentralised 
      healthcare system. This shift is evident as healthcare providers and patients 
      alike are becoming increasingly accepting of wearable-driven tools, as they 
      enable continuous health monitoring outside of traditional clinical settings. 
      Equally, the ubiquitous nature of smartphones, now more than mere communication 
      tools, is being harnessed to serve as pivotal health monitoring instruments. 
      Their added sensing capabilities with Internet of Things (IoT) driven 
      connectivity enable a (relatively) seamless transition from conventional health 
      practices to a more interconnected, digital age. However, this evolving landscape 
      is not without its challenges, with concerns surrounding data privacy, security, 
      and ensuring equitable access to digital advances. As we delve deeper into 
      digital healthcare, we must harness the full potential of those technologies and 
      ensure their ethical and equitable implementation, envisioning a future where 
      healthcare is not just hospital-centric but is part of our daily lives.

TI  - The future of telemedicine and wearable technology in IBD.
PG  - 373-381
LID - 10.1097/MOG.0000000000000845 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Telemedicine has quickly become an essential part of modern 
      healthcare, particularly in the management of chronic conditions like 
      inflammatory bowel disease. The purpose of this review is to describe the current 
      use of telehealth, mobile applications and wearable devices in inflammatory bowel 
      disease and potential future applications. RECENT FINDINGS: Telemedicine was 
      increasingly used during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic. Virtual 
      consultations allowed clinical care to continue despite pandemic-related 
      restrictions without compromising the quality of care for patients with 
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It also benefits patients who would not have 
      access to care due to financial or geographical barriers. Mobile applications 
      allow patients with IBD to record disease activity among other metrics, allowing 
      for earlier healthcare provider intervention. Wearable devices are increasingly 
      being explored to monitor physiological indicators of disease activity and flare. 
      SUMMARY: Telehealth and remote patient monitoring has been successfully 
      integrated into the care of IBD patients. The advantages of these modalities 
      include better access to specialist care and remote noninvasive disease 
      monitoring. Careful consideration must be given to patient privacy, data 
      protection and equitable access. These modalities have enormous potential to 
      improve patient care through accurate consistent data collection and even the 
      prediction of disease activity.

LID - 1993
AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is essential in innovative applications such as 
      smart cities, smart homes, education, healthcare, transportation, and defense 
      operations. IoT applications are particularly beneficial for providing healthcare 
      because they enable secure and real-time remote patient monitoring to improve the 
      quality of people's lives. This review paper explores the latest trends in 
      healthcare-monitoring systems by implementing the role of the IoT. The work 
      discusses the benefits of IoT-based healthcare systems with regard to their 
      significance, and the benefits of IoT healthcare. We provide a systematic review 
      on recent studies of IoT-based healthcare-monitoring systems through literature 
      review. The literature review compares various systems' effectiveness, 
      efficiency, data protection, privacy, security, and monitoring. The paper also 
      explores wireless- and wearable-sensor-based IoT monitoring systems and provides 
      a classification of healthcare-monitoring sensors. We also elaborate, in detail, 
      on the challenges and open issues regarding healthcare security and privacy, and 
      QoS. Finally, suggestions and recommendations for IoT healthcare applications are 
      laid down at the end of the study along with future directions related to various 
      recent technology trends.

AB  - Telemedicine enables the remote provision of medical care through information and 
      communication technologies, facilitating data transmission, patient 
      participation, promotion of heart-healthy habits, diagnosis, early detection of 
      acute decompensation, and monitoring and follow-up of cardiovascular diseases. 
      Wearable devices have multiple clinical applications, ranging from arrhythmia 
      detection to remote monitoring of chronic diseases and risk factors. Integrating 
      these technologies safely and effectively into routine clinical practice will 
      require a multidisciplinary approach. Technological advances and data management 
      will increase telemonitoring strategies, which will allow greater accessibility 
      and equity, as well as more efficient and accurate patient care. However, there 
      are still unresolved issues, such as identifying the most appropriate 
      technological infrastructure, integrating these data into medical records, and 
      addressing the digital divide, which can hamper patients' adoption of remote 
      care. This article provides an updated overview of digital tools for a more 
      comprehensive approach to atrial fibrillation, heart failure, risk factors, and 
      treatment adherence.

AB  - While COVID-19 is still ongoing and associated with more than 5 million deaths, 
      the scope and speed of advances over the past year in terms of scientific 
      discovery, data dissemination, and technology have been staggering. It is not a 
      matter of "if" but "when" we will face the next pandemic, and how we leverage 
      technology and data management effectively to create flexible ecosystems that 
      facilitate collaboration, equitable care, and innovation will determine its 
      severity and scale. The aim of this review is to address emerging challenges that 
      came to light during the pandemic in health care and innovations that enabled us 
      to adapt and continue to care for patients. The pandemic highlighted the need for 
      seismic shifts in care paradigms and technology with considerations related to 
      the digital divide and health literacy for digital health interventions to reach 
      full potential and improve health outcomes. We discuss advances in telemedicine, 
      remote patient monitoring, and emerging wearable technologies. Despite the 
      promise of digital health, we emphasise the importance of addressing its 
      limitations, including interpretation challenges, accuracy of findings, and 
      artificial intelligence-driven algorithms. We summarise the most recent 
      recommendation of the Virtual Care Task Force to scaling virtual medical services 
      in Canada. Finally, we propose a model for optimal implementation of health 
      digital innovations with 5 tenets including data management, data security, 
      digital biomarkers, useful artificial intelligence, and clinical integration.

AB  - Policy Points Millions of life-sustaining implantable devices collect and relay 
      massive amounts of digital health data, increasingly by using user-downloaded 
      smartphone applications to facilitate data relay to clinicians via manufacturer 
      servers. Our analysis of health privacy laws indicates that most US patients may 
      have little access to their own digital health data in the United States under 
      the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Privacy Rule, whereas the 
      EU General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act 
      grant greater access to device-collected data. Our normative analysis argues for 
      consistently granting patients access to the raw data collected by their 
      implantable devices. CONTEXT: Millions of life-sustaining implantable devices 
      collect and relay massive amounts of digital health data, increasingly by using 
      user-downloaded smartphone applications to facilitate data relay to clinicians 
      via manufacturer servers. Whether patients have either legal or normative claims 
      to data collected by these devices, particularly in the raw, granular format 
      beyond that summarized in their medical records, remains incompletely explored. 
      METHODS: Using pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) as a 
      clinical model, we outline the clinical ecosystem of data collection, relay, 
      retrieval, and documentation. We consider the legal implications of US and 
      European privacy regulations for patient access to either summary or raw device 
      data. Lastly, we evaluate ethical arguments for or against providing patients 
      access to data beyond the summaries presented in medical records. FINDINGS: Our 
      analysis of applicable health privacy laws indicates that US patients may have 
      little access to their raw data collected and held by device manufacturers in the 
      United States under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
      Privacy Rule, whereas the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) grants 
      greater access to device-collected data when the processing of personal data 
      falls under the GDPR's territorial scope. The California Consumer Privacy Act, 
      the "little sister" of the GDPR, also grants greater rights to California 
      residents. By contrast, our normative analysis argues for consistently granting 
      patients access to the raw data collected by their implantable devices. 
      Smartphone applications are increasingly involved in the collection, relay, 
      retrieval, and documentation of these data. Therefore, we argue that smartphone 
      user agreements are an emerging but potentially underutilized opportunity for 
      clarifying both legal and ethical claims for device-derived data. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Current health privacy legislation incompletely supports patients' normative 
      claims for access to digital health data.

AB  - The recent pandemic with SARS-CoV-2 raises questions worldwide regarding 
      telemedicine for housebound patients, including those with cardiovascular 
      conditions. The need for further investigation, monitoring and therapeutic 
      management are advancing practical issues which had not been identified for 
      consideration prior to the pandemic. Using the marketing assessment, we 
      identified the needs of the patients and evaluated the future steps necessary in 
      the short term to meet them. The research found progress made via telemedicine in 
      monitoring and conducting minor decisions (like up-titrating the doses of 
      different medication regimens) in patients with several cardiovascular diseases 
      (heart failure, atrial fibrillation, high blood pressure), as there is a 
      worldwide trend to develop new telemonitoring biosensors and devices based on 
      implantable delivered transcatheter. The worldwide telemedicine trend encourages 
      a switch from small and hesitating steps to a more consistent assessment of the 
      patients, based on high technology and Interventional Cardiology. Cardiovascular 
      telemedicine, although made a sustainable effort in managing patients' health, 
      has many obstacles to overcome before meeting all their needs. Data security, 
      confidentiality and reimbursement are the top priorities in developing remote 
      Cardiology. The regulatory institutions need to play an integrative role in 
      leading the way for defining the framework of future telemedicine activities. The 
      SARS-CoV-2 outbreak with all its tragedy served to reinforce the message that 
      telemedicine services can be life-saving for cardiovascular patients. Once the 
      Covid-19 era will fade away, telemedicine is likely to remain a complementary 
      service of standard care. There is still room to improve the remote 
      identification and investigation of heart disease, provide an accurate diagnosis 
      and therapeutic regimen, and update regulations and guidelines to the new 
      realities of technological progress in the field.

AB  - Heart rate at rest and exercise may predict cardiovascular risk. Heart rate 
      variability is a measure of variation in time between each heartbeat, 
      representing the balance between the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous 
      system and may predict adverse cardiovascular events. With advances in technology 
      and increasing commercial interest, the scope of remote monitoring health systems 
      has expanded. In this review, we discuss the concepts behind cardiac signal 
      generation and recording, wearable devices, pros and cons focusing on accuracy, 
      ease of application of commercial and medical grade diagnostic devices, which 
      showed promising results in terms of reliability and value. Incorporation of 
      artificial intelligence and cloud based remote monitoring have been evolving to 
      facilitate timely data processing, improve patient convenience and ensure data 
      security.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality 
      worldwide. The advent of smart technologies has significantly impacted the 
      management of CVD, offering innovative tools and solutions to improve patient 
      outcomes. Smart technologies have revolutionized and transformed the management 
      of CVD, providing innovative tools to improve patient care, enhance diagnostics, 
      and enable more personalized treatment approaches. These smart tools encompass a 
      wide range of technologies, including wearable devices, mobile applications,3D 
      printing technologies, artificial intelligence (AI), remote monitoring systems, 
      and electronic health records (EHR). They offer numerous advantages, such as 
      real-time monitoring, early detection of abnormalities, remote patient 
      management, and data-driven decision-making. However, they also come with certain 
      limitations and challenges, including data privacy concerns, technical issues, 
      and the need for regulatory frameworks. In this review, despite these challenges, 
      the future of smart technologies in CVD management looks promising, with 
      advancements in AI algorithms, telemedicine platforms, and bio fabrication 
      techniques opening new possibilities for personalized and efficient care. In this 
      article, we also explore the role of smart technologies in CVD management, their 
      advantages and disadvantages, limitations, current applications, and their smart 
      future.

AB  - Objectives. Remote monitoring (RM) of health-related outcomes may optimize cancer 
      care and prevention outside of clinic settings. CYCORE is a software-based system 
      for collection and analyses of sensor and mobile data. We evaluated CYCORE's 
      feasibility in studies assessing: (1) physical functioning in colorectal cancer 
      (CRC) patients; (2) swallowing exercise adherence in head and neck cancer (HNC) 
      patients during radiation therapy; and (3) tobacco use in cancer survivors 
      post-tobacco treatment (TTP). Methods. Participants completed RM: for CRC, blood 
      pressure, activity, GPS; for HNC, video of swallowing exercises; for TTP, expired 
      carbon monoxide. Patient-reported outcomes were assessed daily. Results. For CRC, 
      HNC and TTP, respectively, 50, 37, and 50 participants achieved 96%, 84%, 96% 
      completion rates. Also, 91-100% rated ease and self-efficacy as highly favorable, 
      72-100% gave equivalent ratings for overall satisfaction, 72-93% had low/no data 
      privacy concerns. Conclusion. RM was highly feasible and acceptable for patients 
      across diverse use cases.

TI  - Patient perspectives on digital healthcare technology in care and clinical trials 
      for motor neuron disease: an international survey.
PG  - 6003-6013
LID - 10.1007/s00415-022-11273-x [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: To capture the patient's attitude toward remote monitoring of motor 
      neuron disease (MND) in care and clinical trials, and their concerns and 
      preferences regarding the use of digital technology. METHODS: We performed an 
      international multi-centre survey study in three MND clinics in The Netherlands, 
      the United Kingdom, and Australia. The survey was co-developed by investigators 
      and patients with MND, and sent to patients by e-mail or postal-mail. The main 
      topics included: patients' attitude towards remote care, participating in 
      decentralized clinical trials, and preferences for and concerns with digital 
      technology use. RESULTS: In total, 332 patients with MND participated. A majority 
      of patients indicated they would be happy to self-monitor their health from home 
      (69%), be remotely monitored by a multidisciplinary care team (75%), and would be 
      willing to participate in clinical trials from home (65%). Patients considered 
      respiratory function and muscle strength most valuable for home-monitoring. The 
      majority of patients considered the use of at least three devices/apps (75%) once 
      a week (61%) to be acceptable for home-monitoring. Fifteen percent of patients 
      indicated they would not wish to perform home-measurements; reporting concerns 
      about the burden and distress of home-monitoring, privacy and data security. 
      CONCLUSION: Most patients with MND exhibited a positive attitude toward the use 
      of digital technology in both care and clinical trial settings. A subgroup of 
      patients reported concerns with home-monitoring, which should be addressed in 
      order to improve widespread adoption of remote digital technology in clinical MND 
      care.

AB  - As the burgeoning field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to permeate the 
      fabric of healthcare, particularly in the realms of patient surveillance and 
      telemedicine, a transformative era beckons. This manuscript endeavors to unravel 
      the intricacies of recent AI advancements and their profound implications for 
      reconceptualizing the delivery of medical care. Through the introduction of 
      innovative instruments such as virtual assistant chatbots, wearable monitoring 
      devices, predictive analytic models, personalized treatment regimens, and 
      automated appointment systems, AI is not only amplifying the quality of care but 
      also empowering patients and fostering a more interactive dynamic between the 
      patient and the healthcare provider. Yet, this progressive infiltration of AI 
      into the healthcare sphere grapples with a plethora of challenges hitherto 
      unseen. The exigent issues of data security and privacy, the specter of 
      algorithmic bias, the requisite adaptability of regulatory frameworks, and the 
      matter of patient acceptance and trust in AI solutions demand immediate and 
      thoughtful resolution .The importance of establishing stringent and far-reaching 
      policies, ensuring technological impartiality, and cultivating patient confidence 
      is paramount to ensure that AI-driven enhancements in healthcare service 
      provision remain both ethically sound and efficient. In conclusion, we advocate 
      for an expansion of research efforts aimed at navigating the ethical complexities 
      inherent to a technology-evolving landscape, catalyzing policy innovation, and 
      devising AI applications that are not only clinically effective but also earn the 
      trust of the patient populace. By melding expertise across disciplines, we stand 
      at the threshold of an era wherein AI's role in healthcare is both ethically 
      unimpeachable and conducive to elevating the global health quotient.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The role of startups has been growing in healthcare delivery, 
      particularly in telehealth and telemedicine. Yet, little has been published about 
      their role in evolving digital healthcare ecosystem. This study aimed to review 
      the literature on telehealth startups to understand their roles, challenges, 
      business models, and directions for sustainable innovation and commercialization. 
      METHODS: Ten databases were screened: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE 
      Xplore, ACM digital library, EBSCOhost, Embase, Medline, Cochrane review, and 
      PsycINFO. The articles were shortlisted based on pre-determined screening 
      criteria, and qualitative synthesis was performed. The quality of included 
      studies was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Cohen's K was 
      calculated to ensure the reliability of the authors scoring on the quality 
      appraisal test and qualitative synthesis. RESULTS: 26 articles were included in 
      the review. Findings are clubbed under five themes: remote and on-demand 
      healthcare; healthcare data management; digital therapeutics; high-tech driven 
      personalized care; and information integration and exchange. Technical 
      infrastructure, regulation, and revenue generation were identified as major 
      challenges for telehealth start-ups. Osterwalder business canvas was the 
      predominantly used model. Value perspectives were recognized for a sustainable 
      telehealth innovation and its commercialization. CONCLUSION: Telehealth startups 
      are evolving to meet digital healthcare needs and playing a significant role in 
      teleconsultations, telemonitoring, and electronic health record solutions. 
      Recently, their focus has shifted towards smartphone-enabled AI-driven 
      personalized care, including digital therapeutics and wearable device innovation. 
      They have significant technical and operational challenges in innovation and 
      commercialization to optimize their role. The review also provides researchers 
      with a new understanding of telehealth startups' sustainable innovation and 
      commercialization through the systematic direction of value proposition, 
      creation, and capture.

AB  - Despite treatment advancements, HF mortality remains high, prompting interest in 
      reducing HF-related hospitalizations through remote monitoring. These advances 
      are necessary considering the rapidly rising prevalence and incidence of HF 
      worldwide, presenting a burden on hospital resources. While traditional 
      approaches have failed in predicting impending HF-related hospitalizations, 
      remote hemodynamic monitoring can detect changes in intracardiac filling pressure 
      weeks prior to HF-related hospitalizations which makes timely pharmacological 
      interventions possible. To ensure successful implementation, structural 
      integration, optimal patient selection, and efficient data management are 
      essential. This review aims to provide an overview of the rationale, the 
      available devices, current evidence, and the implementation of remote hemodynamic 
      monitoring.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major burden in dialysis-dependent chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD5D) patients. Several factors contribute to this vulnerability 
      including traditional risk factors such as age, gender, life style and 
      comorbidities, and non-traditional ones as part of dialysis-induced systemic 
      stress. In this context, it appears of utmost importance to bring a closer 
      attention to CVD monitoring in caring for CKD5D patients to ensure early and 
      appropriate intervention for improving their outcomes. Interestingly, new 
      home-used, self-operated, connected medical devices offer convenient and new 
      tools for monitoring in a fully automated and ambulatory mode CKD5D patients 
      during the interdialytic period. Sensoring devices are installed with WiFi or 
      Bluetooth. Some devices are also available in a cellular version such as the 
      Withings Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) solution. These devices analyze the data 
      and upload the results to Withings HDS (Hybrid data security) platform servers. 
      Data visualization can be viewed by the patient using the Withings Health Mate 
      application on a smartphone, or with a web interface. Health Care Professionals 
      (HCP) can also visualize patient data via the Withings web-based RPM interface. 
      In this narrative essay, we analyze the clinical potential of pervasive wearable 
      sensors for monitoring ambulatory dialysis patients and provide an assessment of 
      such toolkit digital medical health devices currently available on the market. 
      These devices offer a fully automated, unobtrusive and remote monitoring of main 
      vital functions in ambulatory subjects. These unique features provide a 
      multidimensional assessment of ambulatory CKD5D patients covering most 
      physiologic functionalities, detecting unexpected disorders (i.e., volume 
      overload, arrhythmias, sleep disorders) and allowing physicians to judge 
      patient's response to treatment and recommendations. In the future, the wider 
      availability of such pervasive health sensing and digital technology to monitor 
      patients at an affordable cost price will improve the personalized management of 
      CKD5D patients, so potentially resulting in improvements in patient quality of 
      life and survival.

AB  - Fragmentation of healthcare systems through limited cross-speciality 
      communication and intermittent, intervention-based care, without insight into 
      follow-up and compliance, results in poor patient experiences and potentially 
      contributes to suboptimal outcomes. Data-driven tools and novel technologies have 
      the capability to address these shortcomings, but insights from all stakeholders 
      in the care continuum remain lacking. A structured online questionnaire was given 
      to respondents (n = 1432) in nine global geographies to investigate attitudes to 
      the use of data and novel technologies in the management of vascular disease. 
      Patients with coronary or peripheral artery disease (n = 961), physicians 
      responsible for their care (n = 345), and administrators/healthcare leaders with 
      responsibility for commissioning/procuring cardiovascular services (n = 126) were 
      included. Narrative themes arising from the survey included patients' desire for 
      more personalized healthcare, shared decision-making, and improved communication. 
      Patients, administrators, and physicians perceived and experienced deficiencies 
      in continuity of care, and all acknowledged the potential for data-driven 
      techniques and novel technologies to address some of these shortcomings. Further, 
      physicians and administrators saw the 'upstream' segment of the care 
      journey-before diagnosis, at point of diagnosis, and when determining 
      treatment-as key to enabling tangible improvements in patient experience and 
      outcomes. Finally, despite acceptance that data sharing is critical to the 
      success of such interventions, there remains persistent issues related to trust 
      and transparency. The current fragmented care continuum could be improved and 
      streamlined through the adoption of advanced data analytics and novel 
      technologies, including diagnostic and monitoring techniques. Such an approach 
      could enable the refocusing of healthcare from intermittent contacts and 
      intervention-only focus to a more holistic patient view.

AB  - Modernizing inhaled medications through digital technology can help address 
      persistent problems of non-adherence and poor inhaler technique in patients with 
      obstructive lung diseases. With a growing body of supportive clinical studies, 
      advances in digital inhaler sensors and platforms, greater support from payers 
      and healthcare organizations, significant growth with these technologies is 
      expected. While all digital (smart) inhalers record adherence, these are 
      distinguished by their compatibility with commercial inhalers, capabilities to 
      guide inhaler technique, use of patient-reported outcomes, and user-friendliness 
      for both the healthcare professional (HCP) and patient. Due to the complexity and 
      novelty of employing digital inhalers, collaboration with multiple entities 
      within health systems is necessary and a well-planned integration is needed. For 
      HCPs and patients, cybersecurity and privacy are critical, it will require review 
      by each healthcare organization. In the US, some payers reimburse for remote 
      monitoring using digital inhalers, but reimbursement is currently unavailable in 
      other countries. There are several models for remote patient care, as employing 
      an active, ongoing digital interface between the HCP and patient or they may 
      choose to only review data at clinical encounters. Personalization of therapies 
      and feedback are key to success. While digital inhaler malfunction uncommonly 
      occurs, patient attrition over a year is significant. Some patients will be 
      challenged to use digital platforms or have the necessary technology. Additional 
      research is needed to address cost-effectiveness, in vivo accuracy of inspiratory 
      measurement capable devices, ability to teach inhaler technique, their 
      application for monitoring lung function, and lastly real-world adoption and 
      implementation in routine clinical practice.

      Opportunities, Perspectives, and Bottlenecks.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph20105810 [doi]
LID - 5810
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is recently seeing significant advances in 
      teledermatology (TD), also thanks to the developments that have taken place 
      during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the last two years, there was an important 
      development of studies that focused on opportunities, perspectives, and problems 
      in this field. The topic is very important because the telemedicine and AI 
      applied to dermatology have the opportunity to improve both the quality of 
      healthcare for citizens and the workflow of healthcare professionals. This study 
      conducted an overview on the opportunities, the perspectives, and the problems 
      related to the integration of TD with AI. The methodology of this review, 
      following a standardized checklist, was based on: (I) a search of PubMed and 
      Scopus and (II) an eligibility assessment, using parameters with five levels of 
      score. The outcome highlighted that applications of this integration have been 
      identified in various skin pathologies and in quality control, both in eHealth 
      and mHealth. Many of these applications are based on Apps used by citizens in 
      mHealth for self-care with new opportunities but also open questions. A 
      generalized enthusiasm has been registered regarding the opportunities and 
      general perspectives on improving the quality of care, optimizing the healthcare 
      processes, minimizing costs, reducing the stress in the healthcare facilities, 
      and in making citizens, now at the center, more satisfied. However, critical 
      issues have emerged related to: (a) the need to improve the process of diffusion 
      of the Apps in the hands of citizens, with better design, validation, 
      standardization, and cybersecurity; (b) the need for better attention paid to 
      medico-legal and ethical issues; and (c) the need for the stabilization of 
      international and national regulations. Targeted agreement initiatives, such as 
      position statements, guidelines, and/or consensus initiatives, are needed to 
      ensure a better result for all, along with the design of both specific plans and

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an increasingly prevalent chronic, 
      autoimmune, and inflammatory central nervous system illness, whose common 
      symptoms undermine the quality of life of patients and their families. Recent 
      technical breakthroughs potentially offer continuous, reliable, sensitive, and 
      objective remote monitoring solutions for healthcare. Wearables can be useful for 
      evaluating falls, fatigue, sedentary behavior, exercise, and sleep quality in 
      people with MS (PwMS). OBJECTIVE: This scoping review of relevant literature 
      explores studies investigating the perceptions of patients and healthcare 
      professionals (HCPs) about the use of wearable technologies in the management of 
      MS. METHODS: The Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for scoping reviews was 
      used. The search strategy was applied to the databases, MEDLINE via Ovid, Embase, 
      APA PsycInfo, and CINAHL. Further searches were performed in IEEE, Scopus, and 
      Web of Science. The review considered studies reporting quantitative or 
      qualitative data on perceptions and experiences of PwMS and HCPs concerning 
      wearables' usability, satisfaction, barriers, and facilitators. RESULTS: 10 
      studies were included in this review. Wearables' usefulness and accessibility, 
      ease of use, awareness, and motivational tool potential were patient-perceived 
      facilitators of use. Barriers related to anxiety and frustration, complexity, and 
      the design of wearables. Perceived usefulness and system requirements are 
      identified as facilitators of using wearables by HCPs, while data security 
      concerns and fears of increased workload and limited effectiveness in the care 
      plan are identified as barriers to use wearables. CONCLUSIONS: This review 
      contributes to our understanding of the benefits of wearable technologies in MS 
      by exploring perceptions of both PwMS and HCPs. The scoping review provided a 
      broad overview of facilitators and barriers to wearable use in MS. There is a 
      need for further studies underlined with sound theoretical frameworks to provide 
      a robust evidence-base for the optimal use of wearables to empower healthcare 
      users and providers.

TI  - Users' Perceptions Toward mHealth Technologies for Health and Well-being 
      Monitoring in Pregnancy Care: Qualitative Interview Study.
PG  - e28628
LID - 10.2196/28628 [doi]
LID - e28628
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mobile health (mHealth) technologies, such as wearable sensors, smart 
      health devices, and mobile apps, that are capable of supporting pregnancy care 
      are emerging. Although mHealth could be used to facilitate the tracking of health 
      changes during pregnancy, challenges remain in data collection compliance and 
      technology engagement among pregnant women. Understanding the interests, 
      preferences, and requirements of pregnant women and those of clinicians is needed 
      when designing and introducing mHealth solutions for supporting pregnant women's 
      monitoring of health and risk factors throughout their pregnancy journey. 
      OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand clinicians' and pregnant women's 
      perceptions on the potential use of mHealth, including factors that may influence 
      their engagement with mHealth technologies and the implications for technology 
      design and implementation. METHODS: A qualitative study using semistructured 
      interviews was conducted with 4 pregnant women, 4 postnatal women, and 13 
      clinicians working in perinatal care. RESULTS: Clinicians perceived the potential 
      benefit of mHealth in supporting different levels of health and well-being 
      monitoring, risk assessment, and care provision in pregnancy care. Most pregnant 
      and postnatal female participants were open to the use of wearables and health 
      monitoring devices and were more likely to use these technologies if they knew 
      that clinicians were monitoring their data. Although it was acknowledged that 
      some pregnancy-related medical conditions are suitable for an mHealth model of 
      remote monitoring, the clinical and technical challenges in the introduction of 
      mHealth for pregnancy care were also identified. Incorporating appropriate health 
      and well-being measures, intelligently detecting any abnormalities, and providing 
      tailored information for pregnant women were the critical aspects, whereas 
      usability and data privacy were among the main concerns of the participants. 
      Moreover, this study highlighted the challenges of engaging pregnant women in 
      longitudinal mHealth monitoring, the additional work required for clinicians to 
      monitor the data, and the need for an evidence-based technical solution. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Clinical, technical, and practical factors associated with the use 
      of mHealth to monitor health and well-being in pregnant women need to be 
      considered during the design and feasibility evaluation stages. Technical 
      solutions and appropriate strategies for motivating pregnant women are critical 
      to supporting their long-term data collection compliance and engagement with 
      mHealth technology during pregnancy.

TI  - Advancing Dermatological Care: A Comprehensive Narrative Review of 
      Tele-Dermatology and mHealth for Bridging Gaps and Expanding Opportunities beyond 
      the COVID-19 Pandemic.
LID - 10.3390/healthcare11131911 [doi]
LID - 1911
AB  - Mobile health (mHealth) has recently had significant advances in tele-dermatology 
      (TD) thanks to the developments following the COVID-19 pandemic. This topic is 
      very important, as telemedicine and mHealth, when applied to dermatology, could 
      improve both the quality of healthcare for citizens and the workflow in the 
      health domain. The proposed study was centered on the last three years. We 
      conducted an overview on the opportunities, the perspectives, and the problems 
      involved in TD integration with mHealth. The methodology of the narrative review 
      was based on: (I) a search of PubMed and Scopus and (II) an eligibility 
      assessment, using properly proposed parameters. The outcome of the study showed 
      that during the COVID-19 pandemic, TD integration with mHealth advanced rapidly. 
      This integration enabled the monitoring of dermatological problems and 
      facilitated remote specialist visits, reducing face-to-face interactions. AI and 
      mobile apps have empowered citizens to take an active role in their healthcare. 
      This differs from other imaging sectors where information exchange is limited to 
      professionals. The opportunities for TD in mHealth include improving service 
      quality, streamlining healthcare processes, reducing costs, and providing more 
      accessible care. It can be applied to various conditions, such as (but not 
      limited to) acne, vitiligo, psoriasis, and skin cancers. Integration with AI and 
      augmented reality (AR), as well as the use of wearable sensors, are anticipated 
      as future developments. However, integrating TD with mHealth also brings about 
      problems and challenges related to regulations, ethics, cybersecurity, data 
      privacy, and device management. Scholars and policymakers need to address these 
      issues while involving citizens in the process.

TI  - Ethical challenges of using remote monitoring technologies for clinical research: 
      A case study of the role of local research ethics committees in the RADAR-AD 
      study.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Clinical research with remote monitoring technologies (RMTs) has 
      multiple advantages over standard paper-pencil tests, but also raises several 
      ethical concerns. While several studies have addressed the issue of governance of 
      big data in clinical research from the legal or ethical perspectives, the 
      viewpoint of local research ethics committee (REC) members is underrepresented in 
      the current literature. The aim of this study is therefore to find which specific 
      ethical challenges are raised by RECs in the context of a large European study on 
      remote monitoring in all syndromic stages of Alzheimer's disease, and what gaps 
      remain. METHODS: Documents describing the REC review process at 10 sites in 9 
      European countries from the project Remote Assessment of Disease and 
      Relapse-Alzheimer's Disease (RADAR-AD) were collected and translated. Main themes 
      emerging in the documents were identified using a qualitative analysis approach. 
      RESULTS: Four main themes emerged after analysis: data management, participant's 
      wellbeing, methodological issues, and the issue of defining the regulatory 
      category of RMTs. Review processes differed across sites: process duration varied 
      from 71 to 423 days, some RECs did not raise any issues, whereas others raised up 
      to 35 concerns, and the approval of a data protection officer was needed in half 
      of the sites. DISCUSSION: The differences in the ethics review process of the 
      same study protocol across different local settings suggest that a multi-site 
      study would benefit from a harmonization in research ethics governance processes. 
      More specifically, some best practices could be included in ethical reviews 
      across institutional and national contexts, such as the opinion of an 
      institutional data protection officer, patient advisory board reviews of the 
      protocol and plans for how ethical reflection is embedded within the study.

TI  - A conceptual IoT-based early-warning architecture for remote monitoring of 
      COVID-19 patients in wards and at home.
PG  - 100399
LID - 10.1016/j.iot.2021.100399 [doi]
AB  - Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, health services around the globe are struggling. An 
      effective system for monitoring patients can improve healthcare delivery by 
      avoiding in-person contacts, enabling early-detection of severe cases, and 
      remotely assessing patients' status. Internet of Things (IoT) technologies have 
      been used for monitoring patients' health with wireless wearable sensors in 
      different scenarios and medical conditions, such as noncommunicable and 
      infectious diseases. Combining IoT-related technologies with early-warning scores 
      (EWS) commonly utilized in infirmaries has the potential to enhance health 
      services delivery significantly. Specifically, the NEWS-2 has been showing 
      remarkable results in detecting the health deterioration of COVID-19 patients. 
      Although the literature presents several approaches for remote monitoring, none 
      of these studies proposes a customized, complete, and integrated architecture 
      that uses an effective early-detection mechanism for COVID-19 and that is 
      flexible enough to be used in hospital wards and at home. Therefore, this 
      article's objective is to present a comprehensive IoT-based conceptual 
      architecture that addresses the key requirements of scalability, 
      interoperability, network dynamics, context discovery, reliability, and privacy 
      in the context of remote health monitoring of COVID-19 patients in hospitals and 
      at home. Since remote monitoring of patients at home (essential during a 
      pandemic) can engender trust issues regarding secure and ethical data collection, 
      a consent management module was incorporated into our architecture to provide 
      transparency and ensure data privacy. Further, the article details mechanisms for 
      supporting a configurable and adaptable scoring system embedded in wearable 
      devices to increase usefulness and flexibility for health care professions 
      working with EWS.

TI  - Assessment of US Food and Drug Administration-Approved Digital Medical Devices 
      for Just-in-Time Interventions: A Systematic Review.
PG  - 858-869
LID - 10.1001/jamainternmed.2023.2864 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Just-in-time interventions (JITIs) are a type of digital therapeutic 
      intervention that combines remote monitoring tools and algorithms to personalize 
      the delivery of specific interventions at the right time. The US Food and Drug 
      Administration (FDA) regulatory approval documents are often the only available 
      source of information on the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions based on 
      these devices. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the publicly available 
      information from the FDA on all recently approved medical devices used in JITIs 
      to (1) assess how they operate to deliver JITIs and (2) appraise the evidence 
      supporting their performance and clinical effectiveness. EVIDENCE REVIEW: Two 
      reviewers systematically searched the Premarket Notifications (510(k)), Premarket 
      Approvals, De Novo, and Humanitarian Device Exemption databases from January 2019 
      to December 2021 for all entries associated with devices that monitored patients' 
      data over time to personalize the delivery of interventions to treat, prevent, or 
      mitigate health conditions or events. They assessed whether the product summaries 
      (1) enabled an understanding of how the device operated to deliver a JITI (eg, 
      the nature, type, and frequency of the monitoring, the nature of the decision 
      algorithm, and the nature and intended receiver of the intervention); (2) 
      informed about the performance and effectiveness of the JITI; and (3) included 
      information on data security and ownership. FINDINGS: In total, 38 devices were 
      included in this review. These were mainly intended for cardiac conditions (12 
      [31.6%]), diabetes (10 [26.3%]), and neurological diseases (4 [10.5%]). 
      Monitoring devices ranged from wearable (18 of 28 [64.4%]; eg, smartwatches) to 
      implanted sensors (6 of 28 [21.4%]; eg, inserted electrocardiographic sensors). 
      Only 10 of 38 product summaries (26.3%) allowed a full understanding of how the 
      device operated to deliver a JITI. Similarly, only 12 of 28 (42.9%), 12 of 36 
      (33.3%), and 5 of 38 (13.2%) reported the assessment of the performance of the 
      monitoring device, assessment of the decision algorithm, and results of clinical 
      studies assessing the effectiveness of the JITI, respectively. Finally, 14 of 36 
      product summaries (38.9%) included some information on data security, but none 
      included information on data ownership. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: The results of 
      this systematic review suggest that the information publicly available in the FDA 
      databases on the performance and effectiveness of digital medical devices used in 
      JITIs is heterogeneous.

TI  - Past, Present and Future of Home video-electroencephalographic telemetry: A 
      review of the development of in-home video-electroencephalographic recordings.
PG  - S3-S10
LID - 10.1111/epi.16578 [doi]
AB  - Video-electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring is an essential tool in 
      epileptology, conventionally carried out in a hospital epilepsy monitoring unit. 
      Due to high costs and long waiting times for hospital admission, coupled with 
      technological advances, several centers have developed and implemented video-EEG 
      monitoring in the patient's home (home video-EEG telemetry [HVET]). Here, we 
      review the history and current status of three general approaches to HVET: (1) 
      supervised HVET, which entails setting up video-EEG in the patient's home with 
      daily visiting technologist support; (2) mobile HVET (also termed ambulatory 
      video-EEG), which entails attaching electrodes in a health care facility, 
      supplying the patient and carers with the hardware and instructions, and then 
      asking the patient and carer to set up recording at home without technologist 
      support; and (3) cloud-based HVET, which adds to either of the previous models 
      continuous streaming of video-EEG from the home to the health care provider, with 
      the option to review data in near real time, troubleshoot hardware remotely, and 
      interact remotely with the patient. Our experience shows that HVET can be highly 
      cost-effective and is well received by patients. We note limitations related to 
      long-term electrode attachment and correct camera placing while the patient is 
      unsupervised at home, and concerns related to regulations regarding data privacy 
      for cloud services. We believe that HVET opens significant new opportunities for 
      research, especially in the field of understanding the many influences in seizure 
      occurrence. We speculate that in the future HVET may merge into innovative new 
      multisensor approaches to continuously monitoring people with epilepsy.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the vulnerabilities of global health care systems, 
      underscoring the need for innovative solutions to meet the demands of an aging 
      population, workforce shortages, and rising physician burnout. In recent years, 
      wearable technology has helped segue various medical specialties into the digital 
      era, yet its adoption in vascular surgery remains limited. This article explores 
      the applications of wearable devices in vascular surgery and explores their 
      potential outlets, such as enhancing primary and secondary prevention, optimizing 
      perioperative care, and supporting surgical training. The integration of 
      artificial intelligence and machine learning with wearable technology further 
      expands its applications, enabling predictive analytics, personalized care, and 
      remote monitoring. Despite the promising prospects, challenges such as regulatory 
      complexities, data security, and interoperability must be addressed. As the 
      digital health movement unfolds, wearable technology could play a pivotal role in 
      reshaping vascular surgery while offering cost-effective, accessible, and 
      patient-centered care.

AB  - Wearable technologies have emerged as powerful tools in healthcare, offering 
      continuous monitoring and personalized insights outside traditional clinical 
      settings. These devices have garnered significant attention in cardiovascular 
      medicine for their potential to transform patient care and improve outcomes. This 
      comprehensive review provides an overview of wearable technologies' evolution, 
      advancements, and applications in cardiovascular medicine. We examine the 
      miniaturization of sensors, integration of artificial intelligence (AI), and 
      proliferation of remote patient monitoring solutions. Key findings include the 
      role of wearables in the early detection of cardiovascular conditions, 
      personalized health tracking, and remote patient management. Challenges such as 
      data privacy concerns and regulatory hurdles are also addressed. The adoption of 
      wearable technologies holds promise for shifting healthcare from reactive to 
      proactive, enabling precision diagnostics, treatment optimization, and preventive 
      strategies. Collaboration among healthcare stakeholders is essential to 
      harnessing the full potential of wearables in cardiovascular medicine and 
      ushering in a new era of personalized, proactive healthcare.

TI  - It's not about the capture, it's about what we can learn": a qualitative study of 
      experts' opinions and experiences regarding the use of wearable sensors to 
      measure gait and physical activity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of wearable sensor technology to collect patient health data, 
      such as gait and physical activity, offers the potential to transform healthcare 
      research. To maximise the use of wearable devices in practice, it is important 
      that they are usable by, and offer value to, all stakeholders. Although previous 
      research has explored participants' opinions of devices, to date, limited studies 
      have explored the experiences and opinions of the researchers who use and 
      implement them. Researchers offer a unique insight into wearable devices as they 
      may have access to multiple devices and cohorts, and thus gain a thorough 
      understanding as to how and where this area needs to progress. Therefore, the aim 
      of this study was to explore the experiences and opinions of researchers from 
      academic, industry and clinical contexts, in the use of wearable devices to 
      measure gait and physical activity. METHODS: Twenty professionals with experience 
      using wearable devices in research were recruited from academic, industry and 
      clinical backgrounds. Independent, semi-structured interviews were conducted, 
      audio-recorded and transcribed. Transcribed texts were analysed using inductive 
      thematic analysis. RESULTS: Five themes were identified: (1) The positives and 
      negatives of using wearable devices in research, (2) The routine implementation 
      of wearable devices into research and clinical practice, (3) The importance of 
      compromise in protocols, (4) Securing good quality data, and (5) A paradigm 
      shift. Researchers overwhelmingly supported the use of wearable sensor technology 
      due to the insights that they may provide. Though barriers remain, researchers 
      were pragmatic towards these, believing that there is a paradigm shift happening 
      in this area of research that ultimately requires mistakes and significant 
      volumes of further research to allow it to progress. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple 
      barriers to the use of wearable devices in research and clinical practice remain, 
      including data management and clear clinical utility. However, researchers 
      strongly believe that the potential benefit of these devices to support and 
      create new clinical insights for patient care, is greater than any current 
      barrier. Multi-disciplinary research integrating the expertise of both academia, 
      industry and clinicians is a fundamental necessity to further develop wearable 
      devices and protocols that match the varied needs of all stakeholders.

TI  - Older Adults' and Clinicians' Perspectives on a Smart Health Platform for the 
      Aging Population: Design and Evaluation Study.
PG  - e29623
LID - 10.2196/29623 [doi]
LID - e29623
AB  - BACKGROUND: Over recent years, interest in the development of smart health 
      technologies aimed at supporting independent living for older populations has 
      increased. The integration of innovative technologies, such as the Internet of 
      Things, wearable technologies, artificial intelligence, and ambient-assisted 
      living applications, represents a valuable solution for this scope. Designing 
      such an integrated system requires addressing several aspects (eg, equipment 
      selection, data management, analytics, costs, and users' needs) and involving 
      different areas of expertise (eg, medical science, service design, biomedical and 
      computer engineering). OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is 2-fold; we aimed 
      to design the functionalities of a smart health platform addressing 5 chronic 
      conditions prevalent in the older population (ie, hearing loss, cardiovascular 
      diseases, cognitive impairments, mental health problems, and balance disorders) 
      by considering both older adults' and clinicians' perspectives and to evaluate 
      the identified smart health platform functionalities with a small group of older 
      adults. METHODS: Overall, 24 older adults (aged >65 years) and 118 clinicians 
      were interviewed through focus group activities and web-based questionnaires to 
      elicit the smart health platform requirements. Considering the elicited 
      requirements, the main functionalities of smart health platform were designed. 
      Then, a focus group involving 6 older adults was conducted to evaluate the 
      proposed solution in terms of usefulness, credibility, desirability, and 
      learnability. RESULTS: Eight main functionalities were identified and 
      assessed-cognitive training and hearing training (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; 
      credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 6/6, 100%; learnability: 6/6, 100%), 
      monitoring of physiological parameters (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; credibility: 6/6, 
      100%; desirability: 6/6, 100%; learnability: 5/6, 83%), physical training 
      (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 5/6, 83%; 
      learnability: 2/6, 33%), psychoeducational intervention (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; 
      credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 4/6, 67%; learnability: 2/6, 33%), mood 
      monitoring (usefulness: 4/6, 67%; credibility: 4/6, 67%; desirability: 3/6, 50%; 
      learnability: 5/6, 50%), diet plan (usefulness: 5/6, 83%; credibility: 4/6, 67%; 
      desirability: 1/6, 17%; learnability: 2/6, 33%), and environment monitoring and 
      adjustment (usefulness: 1/6, 17%; credibility: 1/6, 17%; desirability: 0/6, 0%; 
      learnability: 0/6, 0%). Most of them were highly appreciated by older 
      participants, with the only exception being environment monitoring and 
      adjustment. The results showed that the proposed functionalities met the needs 
      and expectations of users (eg, improved self-management of patients' disease and 
      enhanced patient safety). However, some aspects need to be addressed (eg, 
      technical and privacy issues). CONCLUSIONS: The presented smart health platform 
      functionalities seem to be able to meet older adults' needs and desires to 
      enhance their self-awareness and self-management of their medical condition, 
      encourage healthy and independent living, and provide evidence-based support for 
      clinicians' decision-making. Further research with a larger and more 
      heterogeneous pool of stakeholders in terms of demographics and clinical 
      conditions is needed to assess system acceptability and overall user experience 
      in free-living conditions.

TI  - Towards a Remote Monitoring of Patient Vital Signs Based on IoT-Based Blockchain 
      Integrity Management Platforms in Smart Hospitals.
LID - 10.3390/s20082195 [doi]
LID - 2195
AB  - Over the past several years, many healthcare applications have been developed to 
      enhancethe healthcare industry. Recent advancements in information technology and 
      blockchain technologyhave revolutionized electronic healthcare research and 
      industry. The innovation of miniaturizedhealthcare sensors for monitoring patient 
      vital signs has improved and secured the human healthcaresystem. The increase in 
      portable health devices has enhanced the quality of health-monitoringstatus both 
      at an activity/fitness level for self-health tracking and at a medical level, 
      providing moredata to clinicians with potential for earlier diagnosis and 
      guidance of treatment. When sharingpersonal medical information, data security 
      and comfort are essential requirements for interactionwith and collection of 
      electronic medical records. However, it is hard for current systems to meetthese 
      requirements because they have inconsistent security policies and access control 
      structures.The new solutions should be directed towards improving data access, 
      and should be managed bythe government in terms of privacy and security 
      requirements to ensure the reliability of data formedical purposes. Blockchain 
      paves the way for a revolution in the traditional pharmaceuticalindustry and 
      benefits from unique features such as privacy and transparency of data. In this 
      paper,we propose a novel platform for monitoring patient vital signs using smart 
      contracts based onblockchain. The proposed system is designed and developed using 
      hyperledger fabric, which isan enterprise-distributed ledger framework for 
      developing blockchain-based applications. Thisapproach provides several benefits 
      to the patients, such as an extensive, immutable history log, andglobal access to 
      medical information from anywhere at any time. The Libelium e-Health toolkitis 
      used to acquire physiological data. The performance of the designed and developed 
      system isevaluated in terms of transaction per second, transaction latency, and 
      resource utilization usinga standard benchmark tool known as Hyperledger Caliper. 
      It is found that the proposed systemoutperforms the traditional health care 
      system for monitoring patient data.

AB  - Mobile applications provide the healthcare industry with a means of connecting 
      with patients in their own home utilizing their own personal mobile devices such 
      as tablets and phones. This allows therapists to monitor the progress of people 
      under their care from a remote location and all with the added benefit that 
      patients are familiar with their own mobile devices; thereby reducing the time 
      required to train patients with the new technology. There is also the added 
      benefit to the health service that there is no additional cost required to 
      purchase devices for use. The Facial Remote Activity Monitoring Eyewear (FRAME) 
      mobile application and web service framework has been designed to work on the IOS 
      and android platforms, the two most commonly used today. Results: The system 
      utilizes secure cloud based data storage to collect, analyse and store data, this 
      allows for near real time, secure access remotely by therapists to monitor their 
      patients and intervene when required. The underlying framework has been designed 
      to be secure, anonymous and flexible to ensure compliance with the data 
      protection act and the latest General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR); this new 
      standard came into effect in April 2018 and replaces the Data Protection Act in 
      the UK and Europe.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Digital devices have demonstrated benefits to patients with chronic 
      and neurodegenerative diseases. But when patients use medical devices in their 
      homes, the technologies have to fit into their lives. We investigated the 
      technology acceptance of seven digital devices for home use. METHODS: We 
      conducted 60 semi-structured interviews with participants of a larger device 
      study on their views on the acceptability of seven devices. Transcriptions were 
      analysed using qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Based on the unified theory 
      of acceptance and use of technology, we evaluated effort, facilitating 
      conditions, performance expectancy and social influence of each device.In the 
      effort category, five themes emerged: (a) the hassle to use the device; (b) its 
      usability; (c) comfort; (d) disturbance to daily life; and (e) problems during 
      usage. Facilitating conditions consisted of five themes: (a) expectations 
      regarding a device; (b) quality of the instructions; (c) insecurities with usage; 
      (d) possibilities of optimization; and (e) possibilities to use the device 
      longer. Regarding performance expectancy, we identified three themes: (a) 
      insecurities with the performance of a device; (b) feedback; and (c) motivation 
      for using a device. In the social influence category, three themes emerged: (a) 
      reactions of peers; (b) concerns with the visibility of a device; and (c) 
      concerns regarding data privacy. CONCLUSIONS: We identify key factors that 
      determine the acceptability of medical devices for home use from the 
      participants' perspective. These include low effort of use, minor disruptions to 
      their daily lives and good support from the study team.

TI  - Audio-Conversion of Biomedical Signals - A Possible Approach to Improve Remote 
      Monitoring of Elderly and Visually Impaired People.
PG  - 120-126
LID - 10.3233/SHTI230605 [doi]
AB  - Long-term remote patients monitoring implies minimal discomfort and reliability 
      throughout the study period. These requirements are fulfilled by portable 
      (wearable) patient devices, with low consumption, which transmit data wirelessly, 
      at a short distance, to a mobile communication device (GSM) and through it, to a 
      remote end recipient - doctor, medical center or a hospital server. The data 
      transfer technology requires the monitored person to perform a sequence of 
      actions, such as: selecting the appropriate application on the mobile phone, 
      establishing a connection between the patient module and the phone, recording the 
      data in the phone's memory, starting the data transfer from the phone to the 
      final receiver. Practice shows that often this sequence of activities is 
      difficult for elderly people and especially for visually impaired people, which 
      as a result compromises the remote monitoring process. In this paper are 
      presented an approach and conceptual implementation of a system for remote 
      monitoring of cardiac activity, using the most popular way of remote connectivity 
      - voice (sound) communication. In addition to the ease of use, this type of 
      communication does not require special data protection, due to the lack of RF 
      interfaces for short-distance data transmission. The presented results of 
      laboratory studies, as well as conducted tests under medical supervision of 
      patients in a cardiology clinic, confirm the workability of the proposed approach 
      for remote monitoring of patients by audio conversion of the ECG signal.

      Cardiovascular Disease.
PG  - e62157
LID - 10.7759/cureus.62157 [doi]
LID - e62157
AB  - Mobile health (mHealth) interventions have emerged as a promising approach for 
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention and management. The proliferation of 
      smartphones and wearable devices enables convenient access to health monitoring 
      tools, educational resources, and communication with healthcare providers. 
      mHealth interventions encompass mobile apps, wearables, and telehealth services 
      that empower users to monitor vital signs, adhere to medication, and adopt 
      healthier lifestyles. Their effectiveness hinges on user engagement, leveraging 
      behavioral science principles and gamification strategies. While mHealth offers 
      advantages such as personalized support and increased reach, it faces challenges 
      pertaining to data privacy, security concerns, and resistance from healthcare 
      providers. Robust encryption and adherence to regulations like the Health 
      Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) are crucial for safeguarding 
      sensitive health data. Integrating mHealth into clinical workflows can enhance 
      healthcare delivery, but organizational adjustments are necessary. The future of 
      mHealth is closely intertwined with artificial intelligence (AI), enabling remote 
      monitoring, predictive algorithms, and data-driven insights. Tech giants are 
      incorporating advanced health-tracking capabilities into their devices, paving 
      the way for personalized wellness approaches. However, mHealth grapples with 
      ethical dilemmas surrounding data ownership, privacy breaches, and inadvertent 
      data capture. Despite its potential, mHealth necessitates a concerted effort to 
      overcome obstacles and ensure ethical, secure, and practical implementation. 
      Addressing technical challenges, fostering standardization, and promoting 
      equitable access are pivotal for unlocking the transformative impact of mHealth 
      on cardiovascular health and reducing the global burden of CVD.

AB  - Background: Telehealth can improve the treatment of chronic disorders, such as 
      epilepsy. Telehealth prevalence and use increased during the coronavirus disease 
      2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, familiarity with and use of telehealth and 
      health-related mobile applications (apps) by persons with epilepsy remain 
      unknown. Methods: We investigated telehealth use, demographics, and clinical 
      variables within the multicenter Epi2020 cross-sectional study. Between October 
      and December 2020, adults with epilepsy completed a validated questionnaire, 
      including individual questions regarding knowledge and use of apps and 
      telehealth. Results: Of 476 included individuals (58.2% women; mean age 
      40.2 ± 15.4 years), 41.6% reported using health-related apps. Health apps were 
      used more frequently (pedometer 32.1%, exercise app 17.6%) than medical apps 
      (health insurance 15.1%, menstrual apps 12.2%) or apps designed for epilepsy 
      (medication reminders 10.3%, seizure calendars 4.6%). Few used seizure detectors 
      (i.e., apps as medical devices 1.9%) or mobile health devices (fitness bracelet 
      11.3%). A majority (60.9%) had heard the term telehealth, 78.6% of whom had a 
      positive view. However, only 28.6% had a concrete idea of telehealth, and only 
      16.6% reported personal experience with telehealth. A majority (55%) would attend 
      a teleconsultation follow-up, and 41.2% would in a medical emergency. Data 
      privacy and availability were considered equally important by 50.8%, 21.8% 
      considered data privacy more important, and 20.2% considered data availability 
      more important. Current health-related app use was independently associated with 
      younger age (p = 0.003), higher education (p < 0.001), and subjective 
      COVID-19-related challenges (p = 0.002). Persistent seizure occurrence (vs. 
      seizure freedom ≥12 months) did not affect willingness to use teleconsultations 
      on multivariable logistic regression analysis. Conclusions: Despite positive 
      telehealth views, few persons with epilepsy in Germany are familiar with specific 
      apps or services. Socioeconomic factors influence telehealth use more than 
      baseline epilepsy characteristics. Telehealth education and services should 
      target socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals to reduce the digital care 
      gap. German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS00022024; Universal Trial Number:

TI  - Developing a Novel Ontology for Cybersecurity in Internet of Medical 
      Things-Enabled Remote Patient Monitoring.
LID - 10.3390/s24092804 [doi]
LID - 2804
AB  - IoT has seen remarkable growth, particularly in healthcare, leading to the rise 
      of IoMT. IoMT integrates medical devices for real-time data analysis and 
      transmission but faces challenges in data security and interoperability. This 
      research identifies a significant gap in the existing literature regarding a 
      comprehensive ontology for vulnerabilities in medical IoT devices. This paper 
      proposes a fundamental domain ontology named MIoT (Medical Internet of Things) 
      ontology, focusing on cybersecurity in IoMT (Internet of Medical Things), 
      particularly in remote patient monitoring settings. This research will refer to 
      similar-looking acronyms, IoMT and MIoT ontology. It is important to distinguish 
      between the two. IoMT is a collection of various medical devices and their 
      applications within the research domain. On the other hand, MIoT ontology refers 
      to the proposed ontology that defines various concepts, roles, and individuals. 
      MIoT ontology utilizes the knowledge engineering methodology outlined in Ontology 
      Development 101, along with the structured life cycle, and establishes semantic 
      interoperability among medical devices to secure IoMT assets from vulnerabilities 
      and cyberattacks. By defining key concepts and relationships, it becomes easier 
      to understand and analyze the complex network of information within the IoMT. The 
      MIoT ontology captures essential key terms and security-related entities for 
      future extensions. A conceptual model is derived from the MIoT ontology and 
      validated through a case study. Furthermore, this paper outlines a roadmap for 
      future research, highlighting potential impacts on security automation in 
      healthcare applications.

TI  - Digital Platform for Continuous Monitoring of Patients Using a Smartwatch: 
      Longitudinal Prospective Cohort Study.
PG  - e47388

LID - e47388
AB  - BACKGROUND: Since the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a boost in the digital 
      transformation of the human society, where wearable devices such as a smartwatch 
      can already measure vital signs in a continuous and naturalistic way; however, 
      the security and privacy of personal data is a challenge to expanding the use of 
      these data by health professionals in clinical follow-up for decision-making. 
      Similar to the European General Data Protection Regulation, in Brazil, the Lei 
      Geral de Proteção de Dados established rules and guidelines for the processing of 
      personal data, including those used for patient care, such as those captured by 
      smartwatches. Thus, in any telemonitoring scenario, there is a need to comply 
      with rules and regulations, making this issue a challenge to overcome. OBJECTIVE: 
      This study aimed to build a digital solution model for capturing data from 
      wearable devices and making them available in a safe and agile manner for 
      clinical and research use, following current laws. METHODS: A functional model 
      was built following the Brazilian Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados (2018), where 
      data captured by smartwatches can be transmitted anonymously over the Internet of 
      Things and be identified later within the hospital. A total of 80 volunteers were 
      selected for a 24-week follow-up clinical trial divided into 2 groups, one group 
      with a previous diagnosis of COVID-19 and a control group without a previous 
      diagnosis of COVID-19, to measure the synchronization rate of the platform with 
      the devices and the accuracy and precision of the smartwatch in out-of-hospital 
      conditions to simulate remote monitoring at home. RESULTS: In a 35-week clinical 
      trial, >11.2 million records were collected with no system downtime; 66% of 
      continuous beats per minute were synchronized within 24 hours (79% within 2 days 
      and 91% within a week). In the limit of agreement analysis, the mean differences 
      in oxygen saturation, diastolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure, and 
      heart rate were -1.280% (SD 5.679%), -1.399 (SD 19.112) mm Hg, -1.536 (SD 24.244) 
      mm Hg, and 0.566 (SD 3.114) beats per minute, respectively. Furthermore, there 
      was no difference in the 2 study groups in terms of data analysis (neither using 
      the smartwatch nor the gold-standard devices), but it is worth mentioning that 
      all volunteers in the COVID-19 group were already cured of the infection and were 
      highly functional in their daily work life. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the 
      results obtained, considering the validation conditions of accuracy and precision 
      and simulating an extrahospital use environment, the functional model built in 
      this study is capable of capturing data from the smartwatch and anonymously 
      providing it to health care services, where they can be treated according to the 
      legislation and be used to support clinical decisions during remote monitoring.

      Remote Monitoring of Mobility and Patient-Reported Outcomes as Digital End Points 
      in Future Heart-Failure Trials.
PG  - 45-59
LID - 10.1159/000507696 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Heart failure (HF) affects approximately 26 million people worldwide. With 
      an aging global population, innovative approaches to HF evaluation and management 
      are needed to cope with the worsening HF epidemic. The aim of the Real-Life 
      Multimarker Monitoring in Patients with Heart Failure (REALIsM-HF) study 
      (NCT03507439) is to evaluate a composite instrument comprising remote, real-time, 
      activity-monitoring devices combined with daily electronic patient-reported 
      outcome (ePRO) items in patients who have been hospitalized for HF and are 
      undergoing standard HF assessment (e.g., 6-min walking distance [6MWD], blood 
      biomarkers, Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire [KCCQ], and 
      echocardiography). METHODS: REALIsM-HF is an ongoing, 12-week, observational 
      study enrolling 80-100 patients aged ≥45 years with HF with preserved ejection 
      fraction (HFpEF; EF ≥45%) or reduced EF (HFrEF; EF ≤35%). Statistical analyses 
      will include examining the association between data from wearables (the AVIVO(©) 
      mobile patient management patch or VitalPatch(©) biosensor, and the DynaPort 
      MoveMonitor(©)), daily ePROs, and conventional HF metrics (e.g., serum/plasma 
      biomarkers, 6MWD, KCCQ, and echocardiographic parameters). The feasibility of and 
      patient compliance with at-home devices will be documented, and the data captured 
      for the purpose of establishing reference values in patients with HFpEF or HFrEF 
      will be summarized. CONCLUSIONS: The REALIsM-HF study is to evaluate the 
      longitudinal daily activity profiles of patients with HF and correlate these with 
      changes in serum/plasma biomarker profiles, symptoms, quality of life, and 
      cardiac function and morphology to inform the use of wearable activity monitors 
      for developing novel therapies and managing patients.

TI  - Potential of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) applications in building a smart 
      healthcare system: A systematic review.
PG  - 302-318

AB  - Sudden spurting of Corona virus disease (COVID-19) has put the whole healthcare 
      system on high alert. Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has eased the situation 
      to a great extent, also COVID-19 has motivated scientists to make new 'Smart' 
      healthcare system focusing towards early diagnosis, prevention of spread, 
      education and treatment and facilitate living in the new normal. This review aims 
      to identify the role of IoMT applications in improving healthcare system and to 
      analyze the status of research demonstrating effectiveness of IoMT benefits to 
      the patient and healthcare system along with a brief insight into technologies 
      supplementing IoMT and challenges faced in developing a smart healthcare system. 
      An internet-based search in PUBMED, Google Scholar and IEEE Library for english 
      language publications using relevant terms resulted in 987 articles. After 
      screening title, abstract, and content related to IoMT in healthcare and 
      excluding duplicate articles, 135 articles published in journal with impact 
      factor ≥1 were eligible for inclusion. Also relevant articles from the references 
      of the selected articles were considered. The habituation of IoMT and related 
      technology has resolved several difficulties using remote monitoring, 
      telemedicine, robotics, sensors etc. However mass adoption seems challenging due 
      to factors like privacy and security of data, management of large amount of data, 
      scalability and upgradation etc. Although ample knowledge has been compiled and 
      exchanged, this structured systematic review will help the healthcare 
      practitioners, policymakers/decision makers, scientists and researchers to gauge 
      the applicability of IoMT in healthcare more efficiently.

TI  - Innovative Wearable Sweat Sensor Array for Real-Time Volatile Organic Compound 
      Detection in Noninvasive Diabetes Monitoring.
PG  - 13522-13532
LID - 10.1021/acs.analchem.4c02034 [doi]
AB  - Wearable sweat sensors are reshaping healthcare monitoring, providing real-time 
      data on hydration and electrolyte levels with user-friendly, noninvasive devices. 
      This paper introduces a highly portable two-channel microfluidic device for 
      simultaneous sweat sampling and the real-time detection of volatile organic 
      compound (VOC) biomarkers. This innovative wearable microfluidic system is 
      tailored for monitoring diabetes through the continuous and noninvasive tracking 
      of acetone and ammonia VOCs, and it seamlessly integrates with smartphones for 
      easy data management. The core of this system lies in the utilization of carbon 
      polymer dots (CPDs) and carbon dots (CDs) derived from monomers such as catechol, 
      resorcinol, o-phenylenediamine, urea, and citric acid. These dots are seamlessly 
      integrated into hydrogels made from gelatin and poly(vinyl alcohol), resulting in 
      an advanced solid-state fluorometric sensor coating on a cellulose paper 
      substrate. These sensors exhibit exceptional performance, offering linear 
      detection ranges of 0.05-0.15 ppm for acetone and 0.25-0.37 ppm for ammonia, with 
      notably low detection limits of 0.01 and 0.08 ppm, respectively. Rigorous 
      optimization of operational parameters, encompassing the temperature, sample 
      volume, and assay time, has been undertaken to maximize device performance. 
      Furthermore, these sensors demonstrate impressive selectivity, effectively 
      discerning between biologically similar substances and other potential compounds 
      commonly present in sweat. As this field matures, the prospect of cost-effective, 
      continuous, personalized health monitoring through wearable VOC sensors holds 
      significant potential for overcoming barriers to comprehensive medical care in 
      underserved regions. This highlights the transformative capacity of wearable VOC 
      sweat sensing in ensuring equitable access to advanced healthcare diagnostics, 
      particularly in remote or geographically isolated areas.

TI  - Towards blockchain based federated learning in categorizing healthcare monitoring 
      devices on artificial intelligence of medical things investigative framework.
PG  - 105
LID - 10.1186/s12880-024-01279-4 [doi]
AB  - Categorizing Artificial Intelligence of Medical Things (AIoMT) devices within the 
      realm of standard Internet of Things (IoT) and Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) 
      devices, particularly at the server and computational layers, poses a formidable 
      challenge. In this paper, we present a novel methodology for categorizing AIoMT 
      devices through the application of decentralized processing, referred to as 
      "Federated Learning" (FL). Our approach involves deploying a system on standard 
      IoT devices and labeled IoMT devices for training purposes and attribute 
      extraction. Through this process, we extract and map the interconnected 
      attributes from a global federated cum aggression server. The aim of this 
      terminology is to extract interdependent devices via federated learning, ensuring 
      data privacy and adherence to operational policies. Consequently, a global 
      training dataset repository is coordinated to establish a centralized indexing 
      and synchronization knowledge repository. The categorization process employs 
      generic labels for devices transmitting medical data through regular 
      communication channels. We evaluate our proposed methodology across a variety of 
      IoT, IoMT, and AIoMT devices, demonstrating effective classification and 
      labeling. Our technique yields a reliable categorization index for facilitating 
      efficient access and optimization of medical devices within global servers.

TI  - Secure data communication in WSHN using EXP-MD5 and DHSK-ECC.
LID - 10.3233/THC-240790 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the Healthcare (HC) sector, the usage of Wireless Sensor 
      Healthcare Networks (WSHN) is attaining specific importance. The sensor device is 
      implanted into the patient's body, and the sensed health information of patients 
      is transformed via data aggregating devices like mobile devices, cameras, and so 
      on, to the doctors. Thus, the early signs of diseases are identified, and remote 
      monitoring of the patient's health is carried out by the physician on time. This 
      aids in improving the health condition of the people and reduces the severity of 
      disorders. But, the security gap in HC remains unresolved, despite various 
      advantages. OBJECTIVE: This work proposes secured data communication in WSHN 
      using Exponential Message Digest5 (EXP-MD5) and Diffie Hellman Secret Key-based 
      Elliptic Curve Cryptography (DHSK-ECC) techniques. METHODS: Primarily, the 
      patient registers their details in the Hospital Cloud Server (HCS). With hospital 
      ID and patient ID, public and private keys are generated during registration. 
      Afterward, by utilizing the Navie Shuffling (NS) technique, nCr combinations are 
      created and shuffled. After shuffling, any of the randomly selected combinations 
      are encoded utilizing the American Standard Code for Information Interchange 
      (ASCII) code. For patient authentication, the ASCII code is further converted 
      into a Quick Response(QR) code. Upon successful registration, the patient logs in 
      to HCS. The patient can book for doctor's appointment if the login details are 
      verified with those of the registered details. On consulting the doctor at the 
      pre-informed time, the digital signature is created utilizing the Universal 
      Unique Salt-based Digital Signature Algorithm (UUS-DSA) for authenticating the 
      patient details. Further, for providing accessibility to all the authorized 
      patients, the registered patients on HCS are considered as nodes. Then, an 
      authorized path is created using the EXP-MD5 technique to protect each individual 
      patient's details. The patient's IoT data is sensed, followed by authorized path 
      creation. The data is encrypted via the DHSK-ECC algorithm for secure data 
      transmission. Lastly, all the information is stored in HCS, so that the patient's 
      health condition is regularly monitored by the doctor and the needy advice is 
      suggested to the patients in the future. Also, hash matching is carried out when 
      the doctor needs to access data. RESULTS: The proposed technique's efficacy is 
      validated by the performance analysis in comparison with other conventional 
      techniques. CONCLUSION: In this proposed research, the authentication is 
      performed in multiple scenarios to enhance data security and user privacy. The 
      patient details are authenticated during registration and verification to access 
      the online consultation only by the authorized person. Further, the patient 
      health information is encrypted in the proposed work after consultation so that 
      the intrusion of medical records by malicious users and data tampering is 
      prevented. Also, the sensed data gathered from patients are transferred to the 
      HCS by creating the authorized path, which further enhances the security of 
      patient data. Thus, the data communication of the WSHN is well-secured in this 
      work through multi-level authentication and improved cryptography techniques.

      product to market. There are some obvious limitations, including lack of blinding 
      or masking and small sample size, which render the results less applicable to the 
      real world. Traditional randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are lengthy, 
      expensive, and have a low success rate. There is a growing acknowledgement that 
      the current process no longer fully meets the growing healthcare needs. Advances 
      in technology coupled with proliferation of telehealth modalities, sensors, 
      wearable and connected devices have paved the way for a new paradigm. Virtual 
      randomized controlled trials (vRCTs) have the potential to drastically shorten 
      the clinical trial cycle while maximizing patient-centricity, compliance, and 
      recruitment. This new approach can inform clinical trials in real time and with a 
      holistic view of a patient's health. This paper provides an overview of virtual 
      clinical trials, addressing critical issues, including regulatory compliance, 
      data security, privacy, and ownership.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Common, consumer-grade biosensors mounted on fitness trackers and 
      smartwatches can measure an array of biometrics that have potential utility in 
      post-discharge medical monitoring, especially in remote/rural communities. The 
      feasibility characteristics for wrist-worn biosensors are poorly described for 
      post-COVID conditions and rural populations. METHODS: We prospectively recruited 
      patients in rural communities who were enrolled in an at-home rehabilitation 
      program for post-COVID conditions. They were asked to wear a FitBit Charge 2 
      device and biosensor parameters were analyzed [e.g. heart rate, sleep, and 
      activity]. Electronic patient reported outcome measures [E-PROMS] for mental 
      [bi-weekly] and physical [daily] symptoms were collected using SMS text or email 
      [per patient preference]. Exit surveys and interviews evaluated the patient 
      experience. RESULTS: Ten patients were observed for an average of 58 days and 
      half [N = 5] were monitored for 8 weeks or more. Five patients [50%] had been 
      hospitalized with COVID [mean stay = 41 days] and 4 [36%] had required mechanical 
      ventilation. As baseline, patients had moderate to severe levels of anxiety, 
      depression, and stress; fatigue and shortness of breath were the most prevalent 
      physical symptoms. Four patients [40%] already owned a smartwatch. In total, 575 
      patient days of patient monitoring occurred across 10 patients. Biosensor data 
      was usable for 91.3% of study hours and surveys were completed 82.1% and 78.7% of 
      the time for physical and mental symptoms, respectively. Positive correlations 
      were observed between stress and resting heart rate [r = 0.360, p<0.01], stress 
      and daily steps [r = 0.335, p<0.01], and anxiety and daily steps [r = 0.289, 
      p<0.01]. There was a trend toward negative correlation between sleep time and 
      physical symptom burden [r = -0.211, p = 0.05]. Patients reported an overall 
      positive experience and identified the potential for wearable devices to improve 
      medical safety and access to care. Concerns around data privacy/security were 
      infrequent. CONCLUSIONS: We report excellent feasibility characteristics for 
      wrist-worn biosensors and e-PROMS as a possible substrate for multi-modal disease 
      tracking in post-COVID conditions. Adapting consumer-grade wearables for medical 
      use and scalable remote patient monitoring holds great potential.

TI  - The Collaborative Aging Research Using Technology Initiative: An Open, Sharable, 
      Technology-Agnostic Platform for the Research Community.
PG  - 100-118

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Future digital health research hinges on methodologies to conduct 
      remote clinical assessments and in-home monitoring. The Collaborative Aging 
      Research Using Technology (CART) initiative was introduced to establish a digital 
      technology research platform that could widely assess activity in the homes of 
      diverse cohorts of older adults and detect meaningful change longitudinally. This 
      paper reports on the built end-to-end design of the CART platform, its 
      functionality, and the resulting research capabilities. METHODS: CART platform 
      development followed a principled design process aiming for scalability, use case 
      flexibility, longevity, and data privacy protection while allowing sharability. 
      The platform, comprising ambient technology, wearables, and other sensors, was 
      deployed in participants' homes to provide continuous, long-term (months to 
      years), and ecologically valid data. Data gathered from CART homes were sent 
      securely to a research server for analysis and future data sharing. RESULTS: The 
      CART system was created, iteratively tested, and deployed to 232 homes 
      representing four diverse cohorts (African American, Latinx, low-income, and 
      predominantly rural-residing veterans) of older adults (n = 301) across the USA. 
      Multiple measurements of wellness such as cognition (e.g., mean daily computer 
      use time = 160-169 min), physical mobility (e.g., mean daily transitions between 
      rooms = 96-155), sleep (e.g., mean nightly sleep duration = 6.3-7.4 h), and level 
      of social engagement (e.g., reports of overnight visitors = 15-45%) were 
      collected across cohorts. CONCLUSION: The CART initiative resulted in a minimally 
      obtrusive digital health-enabled system that met the design principles while 
      allowing for data capture over extended periods and can be widely used by the 
      research community. The ability to monitor and manage health digitally within the 
      homes of older adults is an important alternative to in-person assessments in 
      many research contexts. Further advances will come with wider, shared use of the 
      CART system in additional settings, within different disease contexts, and by 
      diverse research teams.

TI  - PUFchain 3.0: Hardware-Assisted Distributed Ledger for Robust Authentication in 
      Healthcare Cyber-Physical Systems.
LID - 10.3390/s24030938 [doi]
LID - 938
AB  - This article presents a novel hardware-assisted distributed ledger-based solution 
      for simultaneous device and data security in smart healthcare. This article 
      presents a novel architecture that integrates PUF, blockchain, and Tangle for 
      Security-by-Design (SbD) of healthcare cyber-physical systems (H-CPSs). 
      Healthcare systems around the world have undergone massive technological 
      transformation and have seen growing adoption with the advancement of 
      Internet-of-Medical Things (IoMT). The technological transformation of healthcare 
      systems to telemedicine, e-health, connected health, and remote health is being 
      made possible with the sophisticated integration of IoMT with machine learning, 
      big data, artificial intelligence (AI), and other technologies. As healthcare 
      systems are becoming more accessible and advanced, security and privacy have 
      become pivotal for the smooth integration and functioning of various systems in 
      H-CPSs. In this work, we present a novel approach that integrates PUF with IOTA 
      Tangle and blockchain and works by storing the PUF keys of a patient's Body Area 
      Network (BAN) inside blockchain to access, store, and share globally. Each 
      patient has a network of smart wearables and a gateway to obtain the 
      physiological sensor data securely. To facilitate communication among various 
      stakeholders in healthcare systems, IOTA Tangle's Masked Authentication Messaging 
      (MAM) communication protocol has been used, which securely enables patients to 
      communicate, share, and store data on Tangle. The MAM channel works in the 
      restricted mode in the proposed architecture, which can be accessed using the 
      patient's gateway PUF key. Furthermore, the successful verification of PUF 
      enables patients to securely send and share physiological sensor data from 
      various wearable and implantable medical devices embedded with PUF. Finally, 
      healthcare system entities like physicians, hospital admin networks, and remote 
      monitoring systems can securely establish communication with patients using MAM 
      and retrieve the patient's BAN PUF keys from the blockchain securely. Our 
      experimental analysis shows that the proposed approach successfully integrates 
      three security primitives, PUF, blockchain, and Tangle, providing decentralized 
      access control and security in H-CPS with minimal energy requirements, data 
      storage, and response time.

TI  - Secure smart home architecture for ambient-assisted living using a multimedia 
      Internet of Things based system in smart cities.

AB  - Recent advances in smartphones and remote monitoring based on the Internet of 
      Things (IoT) have enabled improved multidimensional intelligent services. The 
      advent of IoT-based wearable and multimedia sensors has prevented millions of 
      mishapsthrough seamless and systematic monitoring. An IoT-based monitoring system 
      is composed of several sensor devices to measure vital signs, fall detection, 
      energy consumption, and visual recognition. As the data collected by the sensors 
      are transmitted to cloud storage through the Internet, data security is a major 
      concern when transmitting data from remote locations. To improve data security 
      and prediction accuracy, in this study, we proposed a smart and secure multimedia 
      IoT monitoring system for smart homes backed up by smart grid supervisory control 
      and data acquisition (SCADA). The proposed system employs state-of-the-art IoT 
      microcontrollers and hardware devices and integrates them in a manner that 
      significantly affects the accuracy and speed of the entire system. Furthermore, 
      the information gathered from IoT is securely transferred through private 
      channels and stored on the cloud, which can be accessed authentically and 
      reliably using an information system built into an IoT application. The output 
      was extensively compared in terms of power consumption and delivery ratio, which 
      were based on the values collected with sequence numbers. The comparative 
      analysis demonstrated that the proposed approach provides increased prediction 
      accuracy and better security. Hence, the proposed powerefficient prototype model 
      monitors the entire smart home environment in real time and serves as an early 
      warning system for critical situations.

TI  - Assessing Telemedicine Competency Among Doctors in a Tertiary Care Hospital: A 
      Questionnaire-Based Cross-Sectional Study.
PG  - e57712
LID - 10.7759/cureus.57712 [doi]
LID - e57712
AB  - Background The use of telemedicine in contemporary healthcare has become 
      essential, providing a novel method of delivering care, particularly in rural and 
      underdeveloped areas. This study assesses the telemedicine awareness, knowledge, 
      attitude, skills, and challenges among physicians working in tertiary care 
      hospitals. Methods A cross-sectional study was carried out with 100 doctors from 
      diverse specialties at a tertiary care institution. The questionnaire evaluated 
      five domains: telemedicine awareness and knowledge, telemedicine attitude, 
      telemedicine technology skills, telemedicine utilization patterns, and perceived 
      barriers and educational needs. Results The study indicated that 95% of 
      participants were aware of telemedicine. However, knowledge gaps remained, 
      particularly in legal and ethical concerns (50%) and international rules (40%). 
      Eighty percent of respondents had a favorable opinion of telemedicine, and 85% 
      thought it might improve patient care in rural regions. The proficiency level of 
      telemedicine users was variable: 60% of them had previous experience, and 70% of 
      them rated their proficiency as intermediate or better. According to utilization 
      patterns, 50% of telemedicine users used it at least once a week, primarily for 
      remote monitoring (30%) and video consultations (60%). The study found that 90% 
      of respondents had a high demand for training and educational opportunities. The 
      absence of infrastructure (65%), worries about data security (55%), and patient 
      acceptability (30%) were the main obstacles found. It also highlighted how 
      important it is to have defined policies and collaborate across disciplines. 
      Conclusion The study identifies a good attitude toward telemedicine among doctors 
      as well as a need for improved training and infrastructure. It is essential to 
      tackle these requirements and obstacles in order to successfully incorporate 
      telemedicine into healthcare systems.

TI  - Heart rate trajectories in patients recovering from acute myocardial infarction: 
      A longitudinal analysis of Apple Watch heart rate recordings.
PG  - 270-281
LID - 10.1016/j.cvdhj.2021.05.003 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Using mobile health, vital signs such as heart rate (HR) can be used 
      to assess a patient's recovery process from acute events including acute 
      myocardial infarction (AMI). OBJECTIVE: We aimed to characterize clinical 
      correlates associated with HR change in the subacute period among patients 
      recovering from AMI. METHODS: HR measurements were collected from 91 patients 
      (4447 HR recordings) enrolled in the MiCORE study using the Apple Watch and 
      Corrie smartphone application. Mixed regression models were used to estimate the 
      associations of patient-level characteristics during hospital admission with HR 
      changes over 30 days postdischarge. RESULTS: The mean daily HR at admission was 
      78.0 beats per minute (bpm) (95% confidence interval 76.1 to 79.8), declining 0.2 
      bpm/day (-0.3 to -0.1) under a linear model of HR change. History of coronary 
      artery bypass graft, history of depression, or being discharged on anticoagulants 
      was associated with a higher admission HR. Having a history of hypertension, type 
      2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), or hyperlipidemia was associated with a slower 
      decrease in HR over time, but not with HR during admission. CONCLUSION: While a 
      declining HR was observed in AMI patients over 30 days postdischarge, patients 
      with hypertension, T2DM, or hyperlipidemia showed a slower decrease in HR 
      relative to their counterparts. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using 
      wearables to model the recovery process of patients with AMI and represents a 
      first step in helping pinpoint patients vulnerable to decompensation.
