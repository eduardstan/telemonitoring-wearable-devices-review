AB  - The increasing availability of biomedical data from large biobanks, electronic 
      health records, medical imaging, wearable and ambient biosensors, and the lower 
      cost of genome and microbiome sequencing have set the stage for the development 
      of multimodal artificial intelligence solutions that capture the complexity of 
      human health and disease. In this Review, we outline the key applications 
      enabled, along with the technical and analytical challenges. We explore 
      opportunities in personalized medicine, digital clinical trials, remote 
      monitoring and care, pandemic surveillance, digital twin technology and virtual 
      health assistants. Further, we survey the data, modeling and privacy challenges 
      that must be overcome to realize the full potential of multimodal artificial 
      intelligence in health.

TI  - Improvements in Patient Monitoring in the Intensive Care Unit: Survey Study.
PG  - e19091
LID - 10.2196/19091 [doi]
LID - e19091
AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to demographic change and, more recently, coronavirus disease 
      (COVID-19), the importance of modern intensive care units (ICU) is becoming 
      apparent. One of the key components of an ICU is the continuous monitoring of 
      patients' vital parameters. However, existing advances in informatics, signal 
      processing, or engineering that could alleviate the burden on ICUs have not yet 
      been applied. This could be due to the lack of user involvement in research and 
      development. OBJECTIVE: This study focused on the satisfaction of ICU staff with 
      current patient monitoring and their suggestions for future improvements. We 
      aimed to identify aspects of monitoring that interrupt patient care, display 
      devices for remote monitoring, use cases for artificial intelligence (AI), and 
      whether ICU staff members are willing to improve their digital literacy or 
      contribute to the improvement of patient monitoring. We further aimed to identify 
      differences in the responses of different professional groups. METHODS: This 
      survey study was performed with ICU staff from 4 ICUs of a German university 
      hospital between November 2019 and January 2020. We developed a web-based 36-item 
      survey questionnaire, by analyzing a preceding qualitative interview study with 
      ICU staff, about the clinical requirements of future patient monitoring. 
      Statistical analyses of questionnaire results included median values with their 
      bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals, and chi-square tests to compare the 
      distributions of item responses of the professional groups. RESULTS: In total, 86 
      of the 270 ICU physicians and nurses completed the survey questionnaire. The 
      majority stated they felt confident using the patient monitoring equipment, but 
      that high rates of false-positive alarms and the many sensor cables interrupted 
      patient care. Regarding future improvements, respondents asked for wireless 
      sensors, a reduction in the number of false-positive alarms, and hospital 
      standard operating procedures for alarm management. Responses to the display 
      devices proposed for remote patient monitoring were divided. Most respondents 
      indicated it would be useful for earlier alerting or when they were responsible 
      for multiple wards. AI for ICUs would be useful for early detection of 
      complications and an increased risk of mortality; in addition, the AI could 
      propose guidelines for therapy and diagnostics. Transparency, interoperability, 
      usability, and staff training were essential to promote the use of AI. The 
      majority wanted to learn more about new technologies for the ICU and required 
      more time for learning. Physicians had fewer reservations than nurses about 
      AI-based intelligent alarm management and using mobile phones for remote 
      monitoring. CONCLUSIONS: This survey study of ICU staff revealed key improvements 
      for patient monitoring in intensive care medicine. Hospital providers and medical 
      device manufacturers should focus on reducing false alarms, implementing hospital 
      alarm standard operating procedures, introducing wireless sensors, preparing for 
      the use of AI, and enhancing the digital literacy of ICU staff. Our results may 
      contribute to the user-centered transfer of digital technologies into practice to 
      alleviate challenges in intensive care medicine. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Continuous Wearable Monitoring Analytics Predict Heart Failure Hospitalization: 
      The LINK-HF Multicenter Study.
PG  - e006513
LID - 10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.119.006513 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Implantable cardiac sensors have shown promise in reducing 
      rehospitalization for heart failure (HF), but the efficacy of noninvasive 
      approaches has not been determined. The objective of this study was to determine 
      the accuracy of noninvasive remote monitoring in predicting HF rehospitalization. 
      METHODS: The LINK-HF study (Multisensor Non-invasive Remote Monitoring for 
      Prediction of Heart Failure Exacerbation) examined the performance of a 
      personalized analytical platform using continuous data streams to predict 
      rehospitalization after HF admission. Study subjects were monitored for up to 3 
      months using a disposable multisensor patch placed on the chest that recorded 
      physiological data. Data were uploaded continuously via smartphone to a cloud 
      analytics platform. Machine learning was used to design a prognostic algorithm to 
      detect HF exacerbation. Clinical events were formally adjudicated. RESULTS: One 
      hundred subjects aged 68.4±10.2 years (98% male) were enrolled. After discharge, 
      the analytical platform derived a personalized baseline model of expected 
      physiological values. Differences between baseline model estimated vital signs 
      and actual monitored values were used to trigger a clinical alert. There were 35 
      unplanned nontrauma hospitalization events, including 24 worsening HF events. The 
      platform was able to detect precursors of hospitalization for HF exacerbation 
      with 76% to 88% sensitivity and 85% specificity. Median time between initial 
      alert and readmission was 6.5 (4.2-13.7) days. CONCLUSIONS: Multivariate 
      physiological telemetry from a wearable sensor can provide accurate early 
      detection of impending rehospitalization with a predictive accuracy comparable to 
      implanted devices. The clinical efficacy and generalizability of this low-cost 
      noninvasive approach to rehospitalization mitigation should be further tested.

TI  - Do patients benefit from omega-3 fatty acids?
PG  - 2884-2901
LID - 10.1093/cvr/cvad188 [doi]
AB  - Omega-3 fatty acids (O3FAs) possess beneficial properties for cardiovascular (CV) 
      health and elevated O3FA levels are associated with lower incident risk for CV 
      disease (CVD.) Yet, treatment of at-risk patients with various O3FA formulations 
      has produced disparate results in large, well-controlled and well-conducted 
      clinical trials. Prescription formulations and fish oil supplements containing 
      low-dose mixtures of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 
      have routinely failed to prevent CV events in primary and secondary prevention 
      settings when added to contemporary care, as shown most recently in the STRENGTH 
      and OMEMI trials. However, as observed in JELIS, REDUCE-IT, and RESPECT-EPA, 
      EPA-only formulations significantly reduce CVD events in high-risk patients. The 
      CV mechanism of action of EPA, while certainly multifaceted, does not depend 
      solely on reductions of circulating lipids, including triglycerides (TG) and LDL, 
      and event reduction appears related to achieved EPA levels suggesting that the 
      particular chemical and biological properties of EPA, as compared to DHA and 
      other O3FAs, may contribute to its distinct clinical efficacy. In vitro and in 
      vivo studies have shown different effects of EPA compared with DHA alone or 
      EPA/DHA combination treatments, on atherosclerotic plaque morphology, LDL and 
      membrane oxidation, cholesterol distribution, membrane lipid dynamics, glucose 
      homeostasis, endothelial function, and downstream lipid metabolite function. 
      These findings indicate that prescription-grade, EPA-only formulations provide 
      greater benefit than other O3FAs formulations tested. This review summarizes the 
      clinical findings associated with various O3FA formulations, their efficacy in 
      treating CV disease, and their underlying mechanisms of action.

AB  - Wearable sensors in healthcare monitoring have recently found widespread 
      applications in biomedical fields for their non- or minimal-invasive, 
      user-friendly and easy-accessible features. Sensing materials is one of the major 
      challenges to achieve these superiorities of wearable sensors for healthcare 
      monitoring, while graphene-based materials with many favorable properties have 
      shown great efficiency in sensing various biochemical and biophysical signals. In 
      this paper, we review state-of-the-art advances in the development and 
      modification of graphene-based materials (i.e., graphene, graphene oxide and 
      reduced graphene oxide) for fabricating advanced wearable sensors with 1D 
      (fibers), 2D (films) and 3D (foams/aerogels/hydrogels) macroscopic structures. We 
      summarize the structural design guidelines, sensing mechanisms, applications and 
      evolution of the graphene-based materials as wearable sensors for healthcare 
      monitoring of biophysical signals (e.g., mechanical, thermal and 
      electrophysiological signals) and biochemical signals from various body fluids 
      and exhaled gases. Finally, existing challenges and future prospects are 
      presented in this area.

AB  - Rapid advances in digital technology and artificial intelligence in recent years 
      have already begun to transform many industries, and are beginning to make 
      headway into healthcare. There is tremendous potential for new digital 
      technologies to improve the care of surgical patients. In this piece, we 
      highlight work being done to advance surgical care using machine learning, 
      computer vision, wearable devices, remote patient monitoring, and virtual and 
      augmented reality. We describe ways these technologies can be used to improve the 
      practice of surgery, and discuss opportunities and challenges to their widespread 
      adoption and use in operating rooms and at the bedside.

AB  - Heart failure (HF) is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. The 
      increasing prevalence of HF and inpatient HF hospitalization has a considerable 
      burden on healthcare cost and utilization. The recognition that hemodynamic 
      changes in pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and left atrial pressure precede the 
      signs and symptoms of HF has led to interest in hemodynamic guided HF therapy as 
      an approach to allow earlier intervention during a heart failure decompensation. 
      Remote patient monitoring (RPM) utilizing telecommunication, cardiac implantable 
      electronic device parameters and implantable hemodynamic monitors (IHM) have 
      largely failed to demonstrate favorable outcomes in multicenter trials. However, 
      one positive randomized clinical trial testing the CardioMEMS device (followed by 
      Food and Drug Administration approval) has generated renewed interest in PAP 
      monitoring in the HF population to decrease hospitalization and improve quality 
      of life. The COVID-19 pandemic has also stirred a resurgence in the utilization 
      of telehealth to which RPM using IHM may be complementary. The cost effectiveness 
      of these monitors continues to be a matter of debate. Future iterations of 
      devices aim to be smaller, less burdensome for the patient, less dependent on 
      patient compliance, and less cumbersome for health care providers with the 
      integration of artificial intelligence coupled with sophisticated data management 
      and interpretation tools. Currently, use of IHM may be considered in advanced 
      heart failure patients with the support of structured programs.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: With the unprecedented advancement of data aggregation and 
      deep learning algorithms, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) 
      are poised to transform the practice of medicine. The field of orthopedics, in 
      particular, is uniquely suited to harness the power of big data, and in doing so 
      provide critical insight into elevating the many facets of care provided by 
      orthopedic surgeons. The purpose of this review is to critically evaluate the 
      recent and novel literature regarding ML in the field of orthopedics and to 
      address its potential impact on the future of musculoskeletal care. RECENT 
      FINDINGS: Recent literature demonstrates that the incorporation of ML into 
      orthopedics has the potential to elevate patient care through alternative 
      patient-specific payment models, rapidly analyze imaging modalities, and remotely 
      monitor patients. Just as the business of medicine was once considered outside 
      the domain of the orthopedic surgeon, we report evidence that demonstrates these 
      emerging applications of AI warrant ownership, leverage, and application by the 
      orthopedic surgeon to better serve their patients and deliver optimal, 
      value-based care.

TI  - Emerging Artificial Intelligence-Empowered mHealth: Scoping Review.
PG  - e35053
LID - 10.2196/35053 [doi]
LID - e35053
AB  - BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized health care delivery 
      in recent years. There is an increase in research for advanced AI techniques, 
      such as deep learning, to build predictive models for the early detection of 
      diseases. Such predictive models leverage mobile health (mHealth) data from 
      wearable sensors and smartphones to discover novel ways for detecting and 
      managing chronic diseases and mental health conditions. OBJECTIVE: Currently, 
      little is known about the use of AI-powered mHealth (AIM) settings. Therefore, 
      this scoping review aims to map current research on the emerging use of AIM for 
      managing diseases and promoting health. Our objective is to synthesize research 
      in AIM models that have increasingly been used for health care delivery in the 
      last 2 years. METHODS: Using Arksey and O'Malley's 5-point framework for 
      conducting scoping reviews, we reviewed AIM literature from the past 2 years in 
      the fields of biomedical technology, AI, and information systems. We searched 3 
      databases, PubsOnline at INFORMS, e-journal archive at MIS Quarterly, and 
      Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Digital Library using keywords such as 
      "mobile healthcare," "wearable medical sensors," "smartphones", and "AI." We 
      included AIM articles and excluded technical articles focused only on AI models. 
      We also used the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
      Meta-Analyses) technique for identifying articles that represent a comprehensive 
      view of current research in the AIM domain. RESULTS: We screened 108 articles 
      focusing on developing AIM models for ensuring better health care delivery, 
      detecting diseases early, and diagnosing chronic health conditions, and 37 
      articles were eligible for inclusion, with 31 of the 37 articles being published 
      last year (76%). Of the included articles, 9 studied AI models to detect serious 
      mental health issues, such as depression and suicidal tendencies, and chronic 
      health conditions, such as sleep apnea and diabetes. Several articles discussed 
      the application of AIM models for remote patient monitoring and disease 
      management. The considered primary health concerns belonged to 3 categories: 
      mental health, physical health, and health promotion and wellness. Moreover, 14 
      of the 37 articles used AIM applications to research physical health, 
      representing 38% of the total studies. Finally, 28 out of the 37 (76%) studies 
      used proprietary data sets rather than public data sets. We found a lack of 
      research in addressing chronic mental health issues and a lack of publicly 
      available data sets for AIM research. CONCLUSIONS: The application of AIM models 
      for disease detection and management is a growing research domain. These models 
      provide accurate predictions for enabling preventive care on a broader scale in 
      the health care domain. Given the ever-increasing need for remote disease 
      management during the pandemic, recent AI techniques, such as federated learning 
      and explainable AI, can act as a catalyst for increasing the adoption of AIM and 
      enabling secure data sharing across the health care industry.

AB  - A confluence of advances in biosensor technologies, enhancements in health care 
      delivery mechanisms, and improvements in machine learning, together with an 
      increased awareness of remote patient monitoring, has accelerated the impact of 
      digital health across nearly every medical discipline. Medical grade 
      wearables-noninvasive, on-body sensors operating with clinical accuracy-will play 
      an increasingly central role in medicine by providing continuous, cost-effective 
      measurement and interpretation of physiological data relevant to patient status 
      and disease trajectory, both inside and outside of established health care 
      settings. Here, we review current digital health technologies and highlight 
      critical gaps to clinical translation and adoption.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence, Data Sensors and Interconnectivity: Future Opportunities 
      for Heart Failure.
PG  - e11
LID - 10.15420/cfr.2019.14 [doi]
LID - e11
AB  - A higher proportion of patients with heart failure have benefitted from a wide 
      and expanding variety of sensor-enabled implantable devices than any other 
      patient group. These patients can now also take advantage of the ever-increasing 
      availability and affordability of consumer electronics. Wearable, on- and 
      near-body sensor technologies, much like implantable devices, generate massive 
      amounts of data. The connectivity of all these devices has created opportunities 
      for pooling data from multiple sensors - so-called interconnectivity - and for 
      artificial intelligence to provide new diagnostic, triage, risk-stratification 
      and disease management insights for the delivery of better, more personalised and 
      cost-effective healthcare. Artificial intelligence is also bringing important and 
      previously inaccessible insights from our conventional cardiac investigations. 
      The aim of this article is to review the convergence of artificial intelligence, 
      sensor technologies and interconnectivity and the way in which this combination 
      is set to change the care of patients with heart failure.

TI  - Challenges of Emerging Wearable Sensors for Remote Monitoring toward Telemedicine 
      Healthcare.
LID - 10.1021/acs.analchem.2c02642 [doi]
AB  - Digitized telemedicine tools with the Internet of Things (IoT) started advancing 
      into our daily lives and have been incorporated with commercial wearable gadgets 
      for noninvasive remote health monitoring. The newly established tools have been 
      steered toward a new era of decentralized healthcare. The advancement of a 
      telemedicine wearable monitoring system has attracted enormous interest in the 
      multimodal big data acquisition of real-time physiological and biochemical 
      information via noninvasive methods for any health-related industries. The 
      expectation of telemedicine wearable creation has been focused on early diagnosis 
      of multiple diseases and minimizing the cost of high-tech and invasive 
      treatments. However, only limited progress has been directed toward the 
      development of telemedicine wearable sensors. This Perspective addresses the 
      advancement of these wearable sensors that encounter multiple challenges on the 
      forefront and technological gaps hampering the realization of health monitoring 
      at molecular levels related to smart materials mostly limited to single use, 
      issues of selectivity to analytes, low sensitivity to targets, miniaturization, 
      and lack of artificial intelligence to perform multiple tasks and secure big data 
      transfer. Sensor stability with minimized signal drift, on-body sensor 
      reusability, and long-term continuous health monitoring provides key analytical 
      challenges. This Perspective also focuses on, promotes, and highlights wearable 
      sensors with a distinct capability to interconnect with telemedicine healthcare 
      for physical sensing and multiplex sensing at deeper levels. Moreover, it points 
      out some critical challenges in different material aspects and promotes what it 
      will take to advance the current state-of-art wearable sensors for telemedicine 
      healthcare. Ultimately, this Perspective is to draw attention to some potential 
      blind spots of wearable technology development and to inspire further development 
      of this integrated technology in mitigating multimorbidity in aging societies 
      through health monitoring at molecular levels to identify signs of diseases.

TI  - Tele-Monitoring Applications in Respiratory Allergy.
LID - 10.3390/jcm13030898 [doi]
LID - 898
AB  - Respiratory allergic diseases affect over 500 million people globally and pose a 
      substantial burden in terms of morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. 
      Restrictive factors such as geographical disparities, infectious pandemics, 
      limitations in resources, and shortages of allergy specialists in underserved 
      areas impede effective management. Telemedicine encompasses real-time visits, 
      store-and-forward option triage, and computer-based technologies for establishing 
      efficient doctor-patient communication. Recent advances in digital technology, 
      including designated applications, informative materials, digital examination 
      devices, wearables, digital inhalers, and integrated platforms, facilitate 
      personalized and evidence-based care delivery. The integration of telemonitoring 
      in respiratory allergy care has shown beneficial effects on disease control, 
      adherence, and quality of life. While the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the 
      adoption of telemedicine, certain concerns regarding technical requirements, 
      platform quality, safety, reimbursement, and regulatory considerations remain 
      unresolved. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in telemonitoring 
      applications holds promise for data analysis, pattern recognition, and 
      personalized treatment plans. Striking the balance between AI-enabled insights 
      and human expertise is crucial for optimizing the benefits of telemonitoring. 
      While telemonitoring exhibits potential for enhancing patient care and healthcare 
      delivery, critical considerations have to be addressed in order to ensure the 
      successful integration of telemonitoring into the healthcare landscape.

TI  - Detection and Monitoring of Viral Infections via Wearable Devices and Biometric 
      Data.
PG  - 1-27
LID - 10.1146/annurev-bioeng-103020-040136 [doi]
AB  - Mounting clinical evidence suggests that viral infections can lead to detectable 
      changes in an individual's normal physiologic and behavioral metrics, including 
      heart and respiration rates, heart rate variability, temperature, activity, and 
      sleep prior to symptom onset, potentially even in asymptomatic individuals. While 
      the ability of wearable devices to detect viral infections in a real-world 
      setting has yet to be proven, multiple recent studies have established that 
      individual, continuous data from a range of biometric monitoring technologies can 
      be easily acquired and that through the use of machine learning techniques, 
      physiological signals and warning signs can be identified. In this review, we 
      highlight the existing knowledge base supporting the potential for widespread 
      implementation of biometric data to address existing gaps in the diagnosis and 
      treatment of viral illnesses, with a particular focus on the many important 
      lessons learned from the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.

      Current and Future Applications.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics12122964 [doi]
LID - 2964
AB  - Substantial milestones have been attained in the field of heart failure (HF) 
      diagnostics and therapeutics in the past several years that have translated into 
      decreased mortality but a paradoxical increase in HF-related hospitalizations. 
      With increasing data digitalization and access, remote monitoring via wearables 
      and implantables have the potential to transform ambulatory care workflow, with a 
      particular focus on reducing HF hospitalizations. Additionally, artificial 
      intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) have been increasingly employed at 
      multiple stages of healthcare due to their power in assimilating and integrating 
      multidimensional multimodal data and the creation of accurate prediction models. 
      With the ever-increasing troves of data, the implementation of AI/ML algorithms 
      could help improve workflow and outcomes of HF patients, especially time series 
      data collected via remote monitoring. In this review, we sought to describe the 
      basics of AI/ML algorithms with a focus on time series forecasting and the 
      current state of AI/ML within the context of wearable technology in HF, followed 
      by a discussion of the present limitations, including data integration, privacy, 
      and challenges specific to AI/ML application within healthcare.

LID - 1656
AB  - With the prevalence of digitalization in all aspects of modern society, health 
      assessment is becoming digital too. Taking advantage of the most recent 
      technological advances and approaching medicine from an interdisciplinary 
      perspective has allowed for important progress in healthcare services. Digital 
      health technologies and biotelemetry devices have been more extensively employed 
      for preventing, detecting, diagnosing, monitoring, and predicting the evolution 
      of various diseases, without requiring wires, invasive procedures, or 
      face-to-face interaction with medical personnel. This paper aims to review the 
      concepts correlated to digital health, classify and describe biotelemetry 
      devices, and present the potential of digitalization for remote health 
      assessment, the transition to personalized medicine, and the streamlining of 
      clinical trials.

AB  - In the past few years, remote monitoring technologies have grown increasingly 
      important in the delivery of healthcare. According to healthcare professionals, a 
      variety of factors influence the public perception of connected healthcare 
      systems in a variety of ways. First and foremost, wearable technology in 
      healthcare must establish better bonds with the individuals who will be using 
      them. The emotional reactions of patients to obtaining remote healthcare services 
      may be of interest to healthcare practitioners if they are given the opportunity 
      to investigate them. In this study, we develop an artificial intelligence-based 
      classification system that aims to detect the emotions from the input data using 
      metaheuristic feature selection and machine learning classification. The proposed 
      model is made to undergo series of steps involving preprocessing, feature 
      selection, and classification. The simulation is conducted to test the efficacy 
      of the model on various features present in a dataset. The results of simulation 
      show that the proposed model is effective enough to classify the emotions from 
      the input dataset than other existing methods.

TI  - Stress Monitoring Using Machine Learning, IoT and Wearable Sensors.
LID - 10.3390/s23218875 [doi]
LID - 8875
AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as a fundamental framework for 
      interconnected device communication, representing a relatively new paradigm and 
      the evolution of the Internet into its next phase. Its significance is pronounced 
      in diverse fields, especially healthcare, where it finds applications in 
      scenarios such as medical service tracking. By analyzing patterns in observed 
      parameters, the anticipation of disease types becomes feasible. Stress monitoring 
      with wearable sensors and the Internet of Things (IoT) is a potential application 
      that can enhance wellness and preventative health management. Healthcare 
      professionals have harnessed robust systems incorporating battery-based wearable 
      technology and wireless communication channels to enable cost-effective 
      healthcare monitoring for various medical conditions. Network-connected sensors, 
      whether within living spaces or worn on the body, accumulate data crucial for 
      evaluating patients' health. The integration of machine learning and cutting-edge 
      technology has sparked research interest in addressing stress levels. 
      Psychological stress significantly impacts a person's physiological parameters. 
      Stress can have negative impacts over time, prompting sometimes costly therapies. 
      Acute stress levels can even constitute a life-threatening risk, especially in 
      people who have previously been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder or 
      schizophrenia. To offer a proactive solution within the realm of smart 
      healthcare, this article introduces a novel machine learning-based system termed 
      "Stress-Track". The device is intended to track a person's stress levels by 
      examining their body temperature, sweat, and motion rate during physical 
      activity. The proposed model achieves an impressive accuracy rate of 99.5%, 
      showcasing its potential impact on stress management and healthcare enhancement.

AB  - Shoulder rehabilitation is a process that requires physical therapy sessions to 
      recover the mobility of the affected limbs. However, these sessions are often 
      limited by the availability and cost of specialized technicians, as well as the 
      patient's travel to the session locations. This paper presents a novel 
      smartphone-based approach using a pose estimation algorithm to evaluate the 
      quality of the movements and provide feedback, allowing patients to perform 
      autonomous recovery sessions. This paper reviews the state of the art in wearable 
      devices and camera-based systems for human body detection and rehabilitation 
      support and describes the system developed, which uses MediaPipe to extract the 
      coordinates of 33 key points on the patient's body and compares them with 
      reference videos made by professional physiotherapists using cosine similarity 
      and dynamic time warping. This paper also presents a clinical study that uses 
      QTM, an optoelectronic system for motion capture, to validate the methods used by 
      the smartphone application. The results show that there are statistically 
      significant differences between the three methods for different exercises, 
      highlighting the importance of selecting an appropriate method for specific 
      exercises. This paper discusses the implications and limitations of the findings 
      and suggests directions for future research.

AB  - Chronic diseases are becoming more widespread. Treatment and monitoring of these 
      diseases require going to hospitals frequently, which increases the burdens of 
      hospitals and patients. Presently, advancements in wearable sensors and 
      communication protocol contribute to enriching the healthcare system in a way 
      that will reshape healthcare services shortly. Remote patient monitoring (RPM) is 
      the foremost of these advancements. RPM systems are based on the collection of 
      patient vital signs extracted using invasive and noninvasive techniques, then 
      sending them in real-time to physicians. These data may help physicians in taking 
      the right decision at the right time. The main objective of this paper is to 
      outline research directions on remote patient monitoring, explain the role of AI 
      in building RPM systems, make an overview of the state of the art of RPM, its 
      advantages, its challenges, and its probable future directions. For studying the 
      literature, five databases have been chosen (i.e., science direct, IEEE-Explore, 
      Springer, PubMed, and science.gov). We followed the (Preferred Reporting Items 
      for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) PRISMA, which is a standard methodology 
      for systematic reviews and meta-analyses. A total of 56 articles are reviewed 
      based on the combination of a set of selected search terms including RPM, data 
      mining, clinical decision support system, electronic health record, cloud 
      computing, internet of things, and wireless body area network. The result of this 
      study approved the effectiveness of RPM in improving healthcare delivery, 
      increase diagnosis speed, and reduce costs. To this end, we also present the 
      chronic disease monitoring system as a case study to provide enhanced solutions 
      for RPMs.

AB  - According to World Health Organization statistics, falls are the second leading 
      cause of unintentional injury deaths worldwide. With older people being 
      particularly vulnerable, detecting, and reporting falls have been the focus of 
      numerous health technology studies. We screened 267 studies and selected 15 that 
      detailed pervasive fall detection and alerting apps that used smartphone 
      accelerometers. The fall datasets used for the analyses included between 4 and 38 
      participants and contained data from young and old subjects, with the recorded 
      falls performed exclusively by young subjects. Threshold-based detection was 
      implemented in six cases, while machine learning approaches were implemented in 
      the other nine, including decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, boosting, and 
      neural networks. All methods could ultimately achieve real-time detection, with 
      reported sensitivities ranging from 60.4 to 99.3% and specificities from 74.6 to 
      100.0%. However, the studies had limitations in their experimental set-ups or 
      considered a restricted scope of daily activities-not always representative of 
      daily life-with which to define falls during the development of their algorithms. 
      Finally, the studies omitted some aspects of data science methodology, such as 
      proper test sets for results evaluation, putting into question whether reported 
      results would correspond to real-world performance. The two primary outcomes of 
      our review are: a ranking of selected articles based on bias risk and a set of 12 
      impactful and actionable recommendations for future work in fall detection.

TI  - Artificial intelligence and machine learning in motor recovery: A rehabilitation 
      medicine perspective.
PG  - 7258-7260
LID - 10.12998/wjcc.v11.i29.7258 [doi]
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are powerful technologies 
      with the potential to revolutionize motor recovery in rehabilitation medicine. 
      This perspective explores how AI and ML are harnessed to assess, diagnose, and 
      design personalized treatment plans for patients with motor impairments. The 
      integration of wearable sensors, virtual reality, augmented reality, and robotic 
      devices allows for precise movement analysis and adaptive neurorehabilitation 
      approaches. Moreover, AI-driven telerehabilitation enables remote monitoring and 
      consultation. Although these applications show promise, healthcare professionals 
      must interpret AI-generated insights and ensure patient safety. While AI and ML 
      are in their early stages, ongoing research will determine their effectiveness in 
      rehabilitation medicine.

TI  - Stress monitoring using wearable sensors: IoT techniques in medical field.
PG  - 1-14
LID - 10.1007/s00521-023-08681-z [doi]
AB  - The concept "Internet of Things" (IoT), which facilitates communication between 
      linked devices, is relatively new. It refers to the next generation of the 
      Internet. IoT supports healthcare and is essential to numerous applications for 
      tracking medical services. By examining the pattern of observed parameters, the 
      type of the disease can be anticipated. For people with a range of diseases, 
      health professionals and technicians have developed an excellent system that 
      employs commonly utilized techniques like wearable technology, wireless channels, 
      and other remote equipment to give low-cost healthcare monitoring. Whether put in 
      living areas or worn on the body, network-related sensors gather detailed data to 
      evaluate the patient's physical and mental health. The main objective of this 
      study is to examine the current e-health monitoring system using integrated 
      systems. Automatically providing patients with a prescription based on their 
      status is the main goal of the e-health monitoring system. The doctor can keep an 
      eye on the patient's health without having to communicate with them. The purpose 
      of the study is to examine how IoT technologies are applied in the medical 
      industry and how they help to raise the bar of healthcare delivered by healthcare 
      institutions. The study will also include the uses of IoT in the medical area, 
      the degree to which it is used to enhance conventional practices in various 
      health fields, and the degree to which IoT may raise the standard of healthcare 
      services. The main contributions in this paper are as follows: (1) importing 
      signals from wearable devices, extracting signals from non-signals, performing 
      peak enhancement; (2) processing and analyzing the incoming signals; (3) 
      proposing a new stress monitoring algorithm (SMA) using wearable sensors; (4) 
      comparing between various ML algorithms; (5) the proposed stress monitoring 
      algorithm (SMA) is composed of four main phases: (a) data acquisition phase, (b) 
      data and signal processing phase, (c) prediction phase, and (d) model performance 
      evaluation phase; and (6) grid search is used to find the optimal values for 
      hyperparameters of SVM (C and gamma). From the findings, it is shown that random 
      forest is best suited for this classification, with decision tree and XGBoost 
      following closely behind.

AB  - Telemedicine and remote patient monitoring (RPM) systems have been gaining 
      interest and received adaptation in healthcare sectors since the COVID-19 
      pandemic due to their efficiency and capability to deliver timely healthcare 
      services while containing COVID-19 transmission. These systems were developed 
      using the latest technology in wireless sensors, medical devices, cloud 
      computing, mobile computing, telecommunications, and machine learning 
      technologies. In this article, a real-time remote patient monitoring system is 
      proposed with an accessible, compact, accurate, and low-cost design. The 
      implemented system is designed to an end-to-end communication interface between 
      medical practitioners and patients. The objective of this study is to provide 
      remote healthcare services to patients who need ongoing care or those who have 
      been discharged from the hospital without affecting their daily routines. The 
      developed monitoring system was then evaluated on 1177 records from MIMIC-III 
      clinical dataset (aged between 19 and 99 years). The performance analysis of the 
      proposed system achieved 88.7% accuracy in generating alerts with logistic 
      regression classification algorithm. This result reflects positively on the 
      quality and robustness of the proposed study. Since the processing time of the 
      proposed system is less than 2 minutes, it can be stated that the system has a 
      high computational speed and is convenient to use in real-time monitoring. 
      Furthermore, the proposed system will fulfil to cover the lower doctor-to-patient 
      ratio by monitoring patients from remote locations and aged people who reside in 
      their residences.

TI  - A Machine Learning-Combined Flexible Sensor for Tactile Detection and Voice 
      Recognition.

AB  - Intelligent sensors have attracted substantial attention for various 
      applications, including wearable electronics, artificial intelligence, healthcare 
      monitoring, and human-machine interactions. However, there still remains a 
      critical challenge in developing a multifunctional sensing system for complex 
      signal detection and analysis in practical applications. Here, we develop a 
      machine learning-combined flexible sensor for real-time tactile sensing and voice 
      recognition through laser-induced graphitization. The intelligent sensor with a 
      triboelectric layer can convert local pressure to an electrical signal through a 
      contact electrification effect without external bias, which has a characteristic 
      response behavior when exposed to various mechanical stimuli. With the special 
      patterning design, a smart human-machine interaction controlling system composed 
      of a digital arrayed touch panel is constructed to control electronic devices. 
      Based on machine learning, the real-time monitoring and recognition of the 
      changes of voice are achieved with high accuracy. The machine learning-empowered 
      flexible sensor provides a promising platform for the development of flexible 
      tactile sensing, real-time health detection, human-machine interaction, and 
      intelligent wearable devices.

TI  - Physiological sensor data cleaning with autoencoders.
LID - 10.1088/1361-6579/ad10c7 [doi]
AB  - Objective.Physiological sensor data (e.g. photoplethysmograph) is important for 
      remotely monitoring patients' vital signals, but is often affected by measurement 
      noise. Existing feature-based models for signal cleaning can be limited as they 
      might not capture the full signal characteristics.Approach.In this work we 
      present a deep learning framework for sensor signal cleaning based on dilated 
      convolutions which capture the coarse- and fine-grained structure in order to 
      classify whether a signal is noisy or clean. However, since obtaining annotated 
      physiological data is costly and time-consuming we propose an autoencoder-based 
      semi-supervised model which is able to learn a representation of the sensor 
      signal characteristics, also adding an element of interpretability.Main 
      results.Our proposed models are over 8% more accurate than existing feature-based 
      approaches with half the false positive/negative rates. Finally, we show that 
      with careful tuning (that can be improved further), the semi-supervised model 
      outperforms supervised approaches suggesting that incorporating the large amounts 
      of available unlabeled data can be advantageous for achieving high accuracy (over 
      90%) and minimizing the false positive/negative rates.Significance.Our approach 
      enables us to reliably separate clean from noisy physiological sensor signal that 
      can pave the development of reliable features and eventually support decisions 
      regarding drug efficacy in clinical trials.

TI  - Advancing Rheumatology Care Through Machine Learning.
PG  - 87-96
LID - 10.1007/s40290-024-00515-0 [doi]
AB  - Rheumatologic diseases are marked by their complexity, involving immune-, 
      metabolic- and mechanically mediated processes which can affect different organ 
      systems. Despite a growing arsenal of targeted medications, many rheumatology 
      patients fail to achieve full remission. Assessing disease activity remains 
      challenging, as patients prioritize different symptoms and disease phenotypes 
      vary. This is also reflected in clinical trials where the efficacy of drugs is 
      not necessarily measured in an optimal way with the traditional outcome 
      assessment. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has catalyzed a digital transformation 
      in healthcare, embracing telemonitoring and patient-reported data via apps and 
      wearables. As a further driver of digital medicine, electronic medical record 
      (EMR) providers are actively engaged in developing algorithms for clinical 
      decision support, heralding a shift towards patient-centered, decentralized care. 
      Machine learning algorithms have emerged as valuable tools for handling the 
      increasing volume of patient data, promising to enhance treatment quality and 
      patient well-being. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are particularly 
      promising for radiological image analysis, aiding in the detection of specific 
      lesions such as erosions, sacroiliitis, or osteoarthritis, with several 
      FDA-approved applications. Clinical predictions, including numerical disease 
      activity forecasts and medication choices, offer the potential to optimize 
      treatment strategies. Numeric predictions can be integrated into clinical 
      workflows, allowing for shared decision making with patients. Clustering patients 
      based on disease characteristics provides a personalized care approach. Digital 
      biomarkers, such as patient-reported outcomes and wearables data, offer insights 
      into disease progression and therapy response more flexibly and outside patient 
      consultations. In association with patient-reported outcomes, disease-specific 
      digital biomarkers via image recognition or single-camera motion capture enables 
      more efficient remote patient monitoring. Digital biomarkers may also play a 
      major role in clinical trials in the future as continuous, disease-specific 
      outcome measurement facilitating decentralized studies. Prediction models can 
      help with patient selection in clinical trials, such as by predicting high 
      disease activity. Efforts are underway to integrate these advancements into 
      clinical workflows using digital pathways and remote patient monitoring 
      platforms. In summary, machine learning, digital biomarkers, and advanced imaging 
      technologies hold immense promise for enhancing clinical decision support and 
      clinical trials in rheumatology. Effective integration will require a 
      multidisciplinary approach and continued validation through prospective studies.

AB  - Epitel has developed Epilog, a miniature, wireless, wearable 
      electroencephalography (EEG) sensor. Four Epilog sensors are combined as part of 
      Epitel's Remote EEG Monitoring platform (REMI) to create 10 channels of EEG for 
      remote patient monitoring. REMI is designed to provide comprehensive spatial EEG 
      recordings that can be administered by non-specialized medical personnel in any 
      medical center. The purpose of this study was to determine how accurate 
      epileptologists are at remotely reviewing Epilog sensor EEG in the 10-channel 
      "REMI montage," with and without seizure detection support software. Three board 
      certified epileptologists reviewed the REMI montage from 20 subjects who wore 
      four Epilog sensors for up to 5 days alongside traditional video-EEG in the EMU, 
      10 of whom experienced a total of 24 focal-onset electrographic seizures and 10 
      of whom experienced no seizures or epileptiform activity. Epileptologists 
      randomly reviewed the same datasets with and without clinical decision support 
      annotations from an automated seizure detection algorithm tuned to be highly 
      sensitive. Blinded consensus review of unannotated Epilog EEG in the REMI montage 
      detected people who were experiencing electrographic seizure activity with 90% 
      sensitivity and 90% specificity. Consensus detection of individual focal onset 
      seizures resulted in a mean sensitivity of 61%, precision of 80%, and false 
      detection rate (FDR) of 0.002 false positives per hour (FP/h) of data. With 
      algorithm seizure detection annotations, the consensus review mean sensitivity 
      improved to 68% with a slight increase in FDR (0.005 FP/h). As seizure detection 
      software, the automated algorithm detected people who were experiencing 
      electrographic seizure activity with 100% sensitivity and 70% specificity, and 
      detected individual focal onset seizures with a mean sensitivity of 90% and mean 
      false alarm rate of 0.087 FP/h. This is the first study showing epileptologists' 
      ability to blindly review EEG from four Epilog sensors in the REMI montage, and 
      the results demonstrate the clinical potential to accurately identify patients 
      experiencing electrographic seizures. Additionally, the automated algorithm shows 
      promise as clinical decision support software to detect discrete electrographic 
      seizures in individual records as accurately as FDA-cleared predicates.

AB  - Hypertension, or elevated blood pressure (BP), is a marker for many 
      cardiovascular diseases and can lead to life threatening conditions such as heart 
      failure, coronary artery disease and stroke. Several techniques have recently 
      been proposed and investigated for non-invasive BP monitoring. The increasing 
      desire for telemonitoring solutions that allow patients to manage their own 
      conditions from home has accelerated the development of new BP monitoring 
      techniques. In this review, we present the recent progress in non-invasive blood 
      pressure monitoring solutions emphasizing clinical validation and trade-offs 
      between available techniques. We introduce the current BP measurement techniques 
      with their underlying operating principles. New promising proof-of-concept 
      studies are presented and recent modeling and machine learning approaches for 
      improved BP estimation are summarized. This aids discussions on how new BP 
      monitors should evaluated in order to bring forth new home monitoring solutions 
      in wearable form factor. Finally, we discuss on unresolved challenges in making 
      convenient, reliable and validated BP monitoring solutions.

TI  - A Wearable Flexible Acceleration Sensor for Monitoring Human Motion.
LID - 10.3390/bios12080620 [doi]
LID - 620
AB  - Skin-inspired flexible wearable acceleration sensors attract much attention due 
      to their advantages of portability, personalized and comfortable experience, and 
      potential application in healthcare monitoring, human-machine interfaces, 
      artificial intelligence, and physical sports performance evaluation. This paper 
      presents a flexible wearable acceleration sensor for monitoring human motion by 
      introducing the island-bridge configuration and serpentine interconnects. 
      Compared with traditional wearable accelerometers, the flexible accelerometer 
      proposed in this paper improves the wearing comfort while reducing the cost of 
      the device. Simulation and experiments under bending, stretching, and torsion 
      conditions demonstrate that the flexible performance of the flexible acceleration 
      sensor can meet the needs of monitoring the daily movement of the human body, and 
      it can work normally under various conditions. The measurement accuracy of the 
      flexible acceleration sensor is verified by comparing it with the data of the 
      commercial acceleration sensor. The flexible acceleration sensor can measure the 
      acceleration and the angular velocity of the human body with six degrees of 
      freedom and recognize the gesture and motion features according to the 
      acceleration characteristics. The presented flexible accelerometers provide great 
      potential in recognizing the motion features that are critical for healthcare 
      monitoring and physical sports performance evaluation.

TI  - Physiological and Behavior Monitoring Systems for Smart Healthcare Environments: 
      A Review.
LID - 10.3390/s20082186 [doi]

AB  - Healthcare optimization has become increasingly important in the current era, 
      where numerous challenges are posed by population ageing phenomena and the demand 
      for higher quality of the healthcare services. The implementation of Internet of 
      Things (IoT) in the healthcare ecosystem has been one of the best solutions to 
      address these challenges and therefore to prevent and diagnose possible health 
      impairments in people. The remote monitoring of environmental parameters and how 
      they can cause or mediate any disease, and the monitoring of human daily 
      activities and physiological parameters are among the vast applications of IoT in 
      healthcare, which has brought extensive attention of academia and industry. 
      Assisted and smart tailored environments are possible with the implementation of 
      such technologies that bring personal healthcare to any individual, while living 
      in their preferred environments. In this paper we address several requirements 
      for the development of such environments, namely the deployment of physiological 
      signs monitoring systems, daily activity recognition techniques, as well as 
      indoor air quality monitoring solutions. The machine learning methods that are 
      most used in the literature for activity recognition and body motion analysis are 
      also referred. Furthermore, the importance of physical and cognitive training of 
      the elderly population through the implementation of exergames and immersive 
      environments is also addressed.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify current patient and provider engagement methods that use 
      technology in allergy and immunology clinics, in hospitals, and at home. DATA 
      SOURCES: Apple App Store and Google searches for allergy and immunology 
      technology applications and PubMed search of literature involving keywords of 
      website, technology, electronic health record, medical devices, disparity in 
      technology, coding for remote patient monitoring, and artificial intelligence. 
      STUDY SELECTIONS: Studies that addressed the keywords were included and narrowed 
      down based on their applicability in the allergy and immunology clinic. RESULTS: 
      There has been rapid innovation in the digital health care space with expansion 
      of electronic medical record services and the patient portal, creation of allergy 
      and immunology-specific medical devices and applications with remote patient 
      monitoring capabilities, and website and artificial intelligence development to 
      interact with patients. CONCLUSION: These technological advances provide distinct 
      advantages to the provider and patient but also have a burden of time for 
      evaluation of the data for the provider and disparate access to certain 
      technologies for patients. The development of these technologies has been 
      fast-tracked since the start of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. With the 
      explosion in telehealth and medical device development, advancement of medical 
      technology is not revealing any signs of slowing down. It is paving a new way to 
      interact with patients in the future.

AB  - Digital health encompasses the use of information and communications technology 
      and the use of advanced computing sciences in healthcare. This review covers the 
      application of digital health in heart failure patients, focusing on 
      teleconsultation, remote monitoring and apps and wearables, looking at how these 
      technologies can be used to support care and improve outcomes. Interest in and 
      use of these technologies, particularly teleconsultation, have been accelerated 
      by the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Remote monitoring of heart failure 
      patients, to identify those patients at high risk of hospitalisation and to 
      support clinical stability, has been studied with mixed results. Remote 
      monitoring of pulmonary artery pressure has a consistent effect on reducing 
      hospitalisation rates for patients with moderately severe symptoms and 
      multiparameter monitoring shows promise for the future. Wearable devices and apps 
      are increasingly used by patients for health and lifestyle support. Some wearable 
      technologies have shown promise in AF detection, and others may be useful in 
      supporting self-care and guiding prognosis, but more evidence is required to 
      guide their optimal use. Support for patients and clinicians wishing to use these 
      technologies is important, along with consideration of data validity and privacy 
      and appropriate recording of decision-making.

TI  - Seizure Diaries and Forecasting With Wearables: Epilepsy Monitoring Outside the 
      Clinic.
PG  - 690404

LID - 690404
AB  - It is a major challenge in clinical epilepsy to diagnose and treat a disease 
      characterized by infrequent seizures based on patient or caregiver reports and 
      limited duration clinical testing. The poor reliability of self-reported seizure 
      diaries for many people with epilepsy is well-established, but these records 
      remain necessary in clinical care and therapeutic studies. A number of wearable 
      devices have emerged, which may be capable of detecting seizures, recording 
      seizure data, and alerting caregivers. Developments in non-invasive wearable 
      sensors to measure accelerometry, photoplethysmography (PPG), electrodermal 
      activity (EDA), electromyography (EMG), and other signals outside of the 
      traditional clinical environment may be able to identify seizure-related changes. 
      Non-invasive scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and minimally invasive subscalp 
      EEG may allow direct measurement of seizure activity. However, significant 
      network and computational infrastructure is needed for continuous, secure 
      transmission of data. The large volume of data acquired by these devices 
      necessitates computer-assisted review and detection to reduce the burden on human 
      reviewers. Furthermore, user acceptability of such devices must be a paramount 
      consideration to ensure adherence with long-term device use. Such devices can 
      identify tonic-clonic seizures, but identification of other seizure semiologies 
      with non-EEG wearables is an ongoing challenge. Identification of electrographic 
      seizures with subscalp EEG systems has recently been demonstrated over long (>6 
      month) durations, and this shows promise for accurate, objective seizure records. 
      While the ability to detect and forecast seizures from ambulatory intracranial 
      EEG is established, invasive devices may not be acceptable for many individuals 
      with epilepsy. Recent studies show promising results for probabilistic forecasts 
      of seizure risk from long-term wearable devices and electronic diaries of 
      self-reported seizures. There may also be predictive value in individuals' 
      symptoms, mood, and cognitive performance. However, seizure forecasting requires 
      perpetual use of a device for monitoring, increasing the importance of the 
      system's acceptability to users. Furthermore, long-term studies with concurrent 
      EEG confirmation are lacking currently. This review describes the current 
      evidence and challenges in the use of minimally and non-invasive devices for 
      long-term epilepsy monitoring, the essential components in remote monitoring 
      systems, and explores the feasibility to detect and forecast impending seizures 
      via long-term use of these systems.

TI  - A remote healthcare monitoring framework for diabetes prediction using machine 
      learning.
PG  - 45-57
LID - 10.1049/htl2.12010 [doi]
AB  - Diabetes is a metabolic disease that affects millions of people each year. It is 
      associated with an increased likelihood of vital organ failures and decreased 
      quality of life. Early detection and regular monitoring are crucial for managing 
      diabetes. Remote patient monitoring can facilitate effective intervention and 
      treatment paradigms using current technology. This work proposes an end-to-end 
      remote monitoring framework for automated diabetes risk prediction and 
      management, using personal health devices, smart wearables and smartphones. A 
      support vector machine was developed for diabetes risk prediction using the Pima 
      Indian Diabetes Database, after feature scaling, imputation, selection and 
      augmentation. This work achieved the performance metrics of accuracy, sensitivity 
      and specificity scores at 83.20%, 87.20% and 79% respectively through the tenfold 
      stratified cross validation method, which is competitive with existing methods. 
      Patients can use multiple healthcare devices, smartphones and smartwatches to 
      measure vital parameters, curb the progression of diabetes and close the 
      communication loop with medical professionals. The proposed framework enables 
      medical professionals to make informed decisions based on the latest diabetes 
      risk predictions and lifestyle insights while attaining unobtrusiveness, reduced 
      cost, and vendor interoperability.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Artificial intelligence is the ability for machines to perform 
      intelligent tasks. Artificial intelligence is already penetrating many aspects of 
      medicine including cardiac surgery. Here, we offer a platform introduction to 
      artificial intelligence for cardiac surgeons to understand the implementations of 
      this transformative tool. RECENT FINDINGS: Artificial intelligence has 
      contributed greatly to the automation of cardiac imaging, including 
      echocardiography, cardiac computed tomography, cardiac MRI and most recently, in 
      radiomics. There are also several artificial intelligence based clinical 
      prediction tools that predict complex outcomes after cardiac surgery. Waveform 
      analysis, specifically, automated electrocardiogram analysis, has seen 
      significant strides with promise in wearables and remote monitoring. 
      Experimentally, artificial intelligence has also entered the operating room in 
      the form of augmented reality and automated robotic surgery. SUMMARY: Artificial 
      intelligence has many potential exciting applications in cardiac surgery. It can 
      streamline physician workload and help make medicine more human again by placing 
      the physician back at the bedside. Here, we offer cardiac surgeons an 
      introduction to this transformative tool so that they may actively participate in 
      creating clinically relevant implementations to improve our practice.

TI  - Monitoring Resistance Training in Real Time with Wearable Technology: Current 
      Applications and Future Directions.
LID - 10.3390/bioengineering10091085 [doi]
LID - 1085
AB  - Resistance training is an exercise modality that involves using weights or 
      resistance to strengthen and tone muscles. It has become popular in recent years, 
      with numerous people including it in their fitness routines to ameliorate their 
      strength, muscle mass, and overall health. Still, resistance training can be 
      complex, requiring careful planning and execution to avoid injury and achieve 
      satisfactory results. Wearable technology has emerged as a promising tool for 
      resistance training, as it allows monitoring and adjusting training programs in 
      real time. Several wearable devices are currently available, such as smart 
      watches, fitness trackers, and other sensors that can yield detailed 
      physiological and biomechanical information. In resistance training research, 
      this information can be used to assess the effectiveness of training programs and 
      identify areas for improvement. Wearable technology has the potential to 
      revolutionize resistance training research, providing new insights and 
      opportunities for developing optimized training programs. This review examines 
      the types of wearables commonly used in resistance training research, their 
      applications in monitoring and optimizing training programs, and the potential 
      limitations and challenges associated with their use. Finally, it discusses 
      future research directions, including the development of advanced wearable 
      technologies and the integration of artificial intelligence in resistance 
      training research.

TI  - The Artificial Intelligence in Teledermatology: A Narrative Review on 
      Opportunities, Perspectives, and Bottlenecks.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph20105810 [doi]
LID - 5810
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is recently seeing significant advances in 
      teledermatology (TD), also thanks to the developments that have taken place 
      during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the last two years, there was an important 
      development of studies that focused on opportunities, perspectives, and problems 
      in this field. The topic is very important because the telemedicine and AI 
      applied to dermatology have the opportunity to improve both the quality of 
      healthcare for citizens and the workflow of healthcare professionals. This study 
      conducted an overview on the opportunities, the perspectives, and the problems 
      related to the integration of TD with AI. The methodology of this review, 
      following a standardized checklist, was based on: (I) a search of PubMed and 
      Scopus and (II) an eligibility assessment, using parameters with five levels of 
      score. The outcome highlighted that applications of this integration have been 
      identified in various skin pathologies and in quality control, both in eHealth 
      and mHealth. Many of these applications are based on Apps used by citizens in 
      mHealth for self-care with new opportunities but also open questions. A 
      generalized enthusiasm has been registered regarding the opportunities and 
      general perspectives on improving the quality of care, optimizing the healthcare 
      processes, minimizing costs, reducing the stress in the healthcare facilities, 
      and in making citizens, now at the center, more satisfied. However, critical 
      issues have emerged related to: (a) the need to improve the process of diffusion 
      of the Apps in the hands of citizens, with better design, validation, 
      standardization, and cybersecurity; (b) the need for better attention paid to 
      medico-legal and ethical issues; and (c) the need for the stabilization of 
      international and national regulations. Targeted agreement initiatives, such as 
      position statements, guidelines, and/or consensus initiatives, are needed to 
      ensure a better result for all, along with the design of both specific plans and 
      shared workflows.

LID - 10.36628/ijhf.2023.0050 [doi]
AB  - The prevalence of heart failure (HF) is increasing, necessitating accurate 
      diagnosis and tailored treatment. The accumulation of clinical information from 
      patients with HF generates big data, which poses challenges for traditional 
      analytical methods. To address this, big data approaches and artificial 
      intelligence (AI) have been developed that can effectively predict future 
      observations and outcomes, enabling precise diagnoses and personalized treatments 
      of patients with HF. Machine learning (ML) is a subfield of AI that allows 
      computers to analyze data, find patterns, and make predictions without explicit 
      instructions. ML can be supervised, unsupervised, or semi-supervised. Deep 
      learning is a branch of ML that uses artificial neural networks with multiple 
      layers to find complex patterns. These AI technologies have shown significant 
      potential in various aspects of HF research, including diagnosis, outcome 
      prediction, classification of HF phenotypes, and optimization of treatment 
      strategies. In addition, integrating multiple data sources, such as 
      electrocardiography, electronic health records, and imaging data, can enhance the 
      diagnostic accuracy of AI algorithms. Currently, wearable devices and remote 
      monitoring aided by AI enable the earlier detection of HF and improved patient 
      care. This review focuses on the rationale behind utilizing AI in HF and explores 
      its various applications.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) enables remote patient monitoring (RPM) 
      which reduces costs by triaging patients to optimize hospitalization and avoid 
      complications. The FDA regulates AI in medical devices and aims to ensure patient 
      safety, effectiveness, and transparent AI solutions. OBJECTIVES: Identify and 
      summarize FDA approved RPM devices to provide information for the US medical 
      device industry based on previous approvals and the markets' needs. METHODS: We 
      searched publicly available databases on FDA-approved RPM devices. Selection 
      criteria were established to classify a solution as AI. Technical information was 
      analyzed on pre-identified 16 parameters for the qualified solutions. RESULTS: A 
      total of 47 RPM devices were reviewed, among which 12.8% were classified as a De 
      Novo product and the remaining devices fell under the 510(K) FDA category. The 
      cardiovascular (74%) AI RPM solutions dominated the US market, followed by 
      ECG-based arrhythmia detection algorithms (59.4%), and Hemodynamics and Vital 
      Sign monitoring algorithms (21.9%). The trend observed in the FDA rejected 
      devices was their inability to be classified into clinically relevant categories 
      (Criteria 2 and 3). CONCLUSION: The market needs more innovative RPM solutions 
      under the De Novo category, as there are very few. The transparency is low on the 
      technical aspect of AI algorithms. The market needs AI algorithms that can 
      effectively classify patients rather than merely improve device functionality.

TI  - Soft Transducer for Patient's Vitals Telemonitoring with Deep Learning-Based 
      Personalized Anomaly Detection.
LID - 10.3390/s22020536 [doi]
LID - 536
AB  - This work addresses the design, development and implementation of a 4.0-based 
      wearable soft transducer for patient-centered vitals telemonitoring. In 
      particular, first, the soft transducer measures hypertension-related vitals 
      (heart rate, oxygen saturation and systolic/diastolic pressure) and sends the 
      data to a remote database (which can be easily consulted both by the patient and 
      the physician). In addition to this, a dedicated deep learning algorithm, based 
      on a Long-Short-Term-Memory Autoencoder, was designed, implemented and tested for 
      providing an alert when the patient's vitals exceed certain thresholds, which are 
      automatically personalized for the specific patient. Furthermore, a mobile 
      application (EcO2u) was developed to manage the entire data flow and facilitate 
      the data fruition; this application also implements an innovative face-detection 
      algorithm that ensures the identity of the patient. The robustness of the 
      proposed soft transducer was validated experimentally on five individuals, who 
      used the system for 30 days. The experimental results demonstrated an accuracy in 
      anomaly detection greater than 93%, with a true positive rate of more than 94%.

AB  - Conservation of biodiversity is critical for the coexistence of humans and the 
      sustenance of other living organisms within the ecosystem. Identification and 
      prioritization of specific regions to be conserved are impossible without proper 
      information about the sites. Advanced monitoring agencies like the 
      Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services 
      (IPBES) had accredited that the sum total of species that are now threatened with 
      extinction is higher than ever before in the past and are progressing toward 
      extinct at an alarming rate. Besides this, the conceptualized global responses to 
      these crises are still inadequate and entail drastic changes. Therefore, more 
      sophisticated monitoring and conservation techniques are required which can 
      simultaneously cover a larger surface area within a stipulated time frame and 
      gather a large pool of data. Hence, this study is an overview of remote 
      monitoring methods in biodiversity conservation via a survey of evidence-based 
      reviews and related studies, wherein the description of the application of some 
      technology for biodiversity conservation and monitoring is highlighted. Finally, 
      the paper also describes various transformative smart technologies like 
      artificial intelligence (AI) and/or machine learning algorithms for enhanced 
      working efficiency of currently available techniques that will aid remote 
      monitoring methods in biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Remote monitoring and artificial intelligence will become common and intertwined 
      in anesthesiology by 2050. In the intraoperative period, technology will lead to 
      the development of integrated monitoring systems that will integrate multiple 
      data streams and allow anesthesiologists to track patients more effectively. This 
      will free up anesthesiologists to focus on more complex tasks, such as managing 
      risk and making value-based decisions. This will also enable the continued 
      integration of remote monitoring and control towers having profound effects on 
      coverage and practice models. In the PACU and ICU, the technology will lead to 
      the development of early warning systems that can identify patients who are at 
      risk of complications, enabling early interventions and more proactive care. The 
      integration of augmented reality will allow for better integration of diverse 
      types of data and better decision-making. Postoperatively, the proliferation of 
      wearable devices that can monitor patient vital signs and track their progress 
      will allow patients to be discharged from the hospital sooner and receive care at 
      home. This will require increased use of telemedicine, which will allow patients 
      to consult with doctors remotely. All of these advances will require changes to 
      legal and regulatory frameworks that will enable new workflows that are different 
      from those familiar to today's providers.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of the present review is to track the evolution of wearable 
      IMUs from their use in supervised laboratory- and ambulatory-based settings to 
      their application for long-term monitoring of human movement in unsupervised 
      naturalistic settings. AREAS COVERED: Four main emerging areas of application 
      were identified and synthesized, namely, mobile health solutions (specifically, 
      for the assessment of frailty, risk of falls, chronic neurological diseases, and 
      for the monitoring and promotion of active living), occupational ergonomics, 
      rehabilitation and telerehabilitation, and cognitive assessment. Findings from 
      recent scientific literature in each of these areas was synthesized from an 
      applied and/or clinical perspective with the purpose of providing clinical 
      researchers and practitioners with practical guidance on contemporary uses of 
      inertial sensors in applied clinical settings. EXPERT OPINION: IMU-based wearable 
      devices have undergone a rapid transition from use in laboratory-based clinical 
      practice to unsupervised, applied settings. Successful use of wearable inertial 
      sensing for assessing mobility, motor performance and movement disorders in 
      applied settings will rely also on machine learning algorithms for managing the 
      vast amounts of data generated by these sensors for extracting information that 
      is both clinically relevant and interpretable by practitioners.

TI  - Remote Monitoring for Prediction and Management of Acute Exacerbations in Chronic 
      Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (AECOPD).
LID - 10.3390/life12040499 [doi]
LID - 499
AB  - The progression of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized 
      by episodes of acute exacerbation (AECOPD) of symptoms, decline in respiratory 
      function, and reduction in quality-of-life increasing morbi-mortality and often 
      requiring hospitalization. Exacerbations can be triggered by environmental 
      exposures, changes in lifestyle, and/or physiological and psychological factors 
      to greater or lesser extents depending on the individual's COPD phenotype. The 
      prediction and early detection of an exacerbation might allow patients and 
      physicians to better manage the acute phase. We summarize the recent scientific 
      data on remote telemonitoring (TM) for the prediction and management of acute 
      exacerbations in COPD patients. We discuss the components of remote monitoring 
      platforms, including the integration of environmental monitoring data; patient 
      reported outcomes collected via interactive Smartphone apps, with data from 
      wearable devices that monitor physical activity, heart rate, etc.; and data from 
      medical devices such as connected non-invasive ventilators. We consider how 
      telemonitoring and the deluge of data it potentially generates could be combined 
      with electronic health records to provide personalized care and multi-disease 
      management for COPD patients.

AB  - Historically, the term "artificial intelligence" dates to 1956 when it was first 
      used in a conference at Dartmouth College in the US. Since then, the development 
      of artificial intelligence has in part been shaped by the field of neuroscience. 
      By understanding the human brain, scientists have attempted to build new 
      intelligent machines capable of performing complex tasks akin to humans. Indeed, 
      future research into artificial intelligence will continue to benefit from the 
      study of the human brain. While the development of artificial intelligence 
      algorithms has been fast paced, the actual use of most artificial intelligence 
      (AI) algorithms in biomedical engineering and clinical practice is still markedly 
      below its conceivably broader potentials. This is partly because for any 
      algorithm to be incorporated into existing workflows it has to stand the test of 
      scientific validation, clinical and personal utility, application context, and is 
      equitable as well. In this context, there is much to be gained by combining AI 
      and human intelligence (HI). Harnessing Big Data, computing power and storage 
      capacities, and addressing societal issues emergent from algorithm applications, 
      demand deploying HI in tandem with AI. Very few countries, even economically 
      developed states, lack adequate and critical governance frames to best understand 
      and steer the AI innovation trajectories in health care. Drug discovery and 
      translational pharmaceutical research stand to gain from AI technology provided 
      they are also informed by HI. In this expert review, we analyze the ways in which 
      AI applications are likely to traverse the continuum of life from birth to death, 
      and encompassing not only humans but also all animal, plant, and other living 
      organisms that are increasingly touched by AI. Examples of AI applications 
      include digital health, diagnosis of diseases in newborns, remote monitoring of 
      health by smart devices, real-time Big Data analytics for prompt diagnosis of 
      heart attacks, and facial analysis software with consequences on civil liberties. 
      While we underscore the need for integration of AI and HI, we note that AI 
      technology does not have to replace medical specialists or scientists and rather, 
      is in need of such expert HI. Altogether, AI and HI offer synergy for responsible 
      innovation and veritable prospects for improving health care from prevention to 
      diagnosis to therapeutics while unintended consequences of automation emergent 
      from AI and algorithms should be borne in mind on scientific cultures, work 
      force, and society at large.

AB  - The rapid growth in computational power, sensor technology, and wearable devices 
      has provided a solid foundation for all aspects of cardiac arrhythmia care. 
      Artificial intelligence (AI) has been instrumental in bringing about significant 
      changes in the prevention, risk assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of 
      arrhythmia. This review examines the current state of AI in the diagnosis and 
      treatment of atrial fibrillation, supraventricular arrhythmia, ventricular 
      arrhythmia, hereditary channelopathies, and cardiac pacing. Furthermore, ChatGPT, 
      which has gained attention recently, is addressed in this paper along with its 
      potential applications in the field of arrhythmia. Additionally, the accuracy of 
      arrhythmia diagnosis can be improved by identifying electrode misplacement or 
      erroneous swapping of electrode position using AI. Remote monitoring has expanded 
      greatly due to the emergence of contactless monitoring technology as wearable 
      devices continue to develop and flourish. Parallel advances in AI computing 
      power, ChatGPT, availability of large data sets, and more have greatly expanded 
      applications in arrhythmia diagnosis, risk assessment, and treatment. More 
      precise algorithms based on big data, personalized risk assessment, telemedicine 
      and mobile health, smart hardware and wearables, and the exploration of rare or 
      complex types of arrhythmia are the future direction.

      Identification.

AB  - As a natural monitor of health conditions for human beings, volatile organic 
      compounds (VOCs) act as significant biomarkers for healthcare monitoring and 
      early stage diagnosis of diseases. Most existing VOC sensors use semiconductors, 
      optics, and electrochemistry, which are only capable of measuring the total 
      concentration of VOCs with slow response, resulting in the lack of selectivity 
      and low efficiency for VOC detection. Infrared (IR) spectroscopy technology 
      provides an effective solution to detect chemical structures of VOC molecules by 
      absorption fingerprints induced by the signature vibration of chemical stretches. 
      However, traditional IR spectroscopy for VOC detection is limited by the weak 
      light-matter interaction, resulting in large optical paths. Leveraging the 
      ultrahigh electric field induced by plasma, the vibration of the molecules is 
      enhanced to improve the light-matter interaction. Herein, we report a 
      plasma-enhanced IR absorption spectroscopy with advantages of fast response, 
      accurate quantization, and good selectivity. An order of ∼kV voltage was achieved 
      from the multiswitched manipulation of the triboelectric nanogenerator by 
      repeated sliding. The VOC species and their concentrations were well-quantified 
      from the wavelength and intensity of spectra signals with the enhancement from 
      plasma. Furthermore, machine learning has visualized the relationship of 
      different VOCs in the mixture, which demonstrated the feasibility of the VOC 
      identification to mimic patients.

TI  - Machine Learning and Internet of Things Enabled Monitoring of Post-Surgery 
      Patients: A Pilot Study.
LID - 10.3390/s22041420 [doi]
LID - 1420
AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) offer immense potential 
      to transform conventional healthcare systems. The IoT and AI enabled smart 
      systems can play a key role in driving the future of smart healthcare. Remote 
      monitoring of critical and non-critical patients is one such field which can 
      leverage the benefits of IoT and machine learning techniques. While some work has 
      been done in developing paradigms to establish effective and reliable 
      communications, there is still great potential to utilize optimized IoT network 
      and machine learning technique to improve the overall performance of the 
      communication systems, thus enabling fool-proof systems. This study develops a 
      novel IoT framework to offer ultra-reliable low latency communications to monitor 
      post-surgery patients. The work considers both critical and non-critical patients 
      and is balanced between these to offer optimal performance for the desired 
      outcomes. In addition, machine learning based regression analysis of patients' 
      sensory data is performed to obtain highly accurate predictions of the patients' 
      sensory data (patients' vitals), which enables highly accurate virtual observers 
      to predict the data in case of communication failures. The performance analysis 
      of the proposed IoT based vital signs monitoring system for the post-surgery 
      patients offers reduced delay and packet loss in comparison to IEEE low latency 
      deterministic networks. The gradient boosting regression analysis also gives a 
      highly accurate prediction for slow as well as rapidly varying sensors for vital 
      sign monitoring.

TI  - Smart Wearables for Cardiac Monitoring-Real-World Use beyond Atrial Fibrillation.
LID - 10.3390/s21072539 [doi]
LID - 2539
AB  - The possibilities and implementation of wearable cardiac monitoring beyond atrial 
      fibrillation are increasing continuously. This review focuses on the real-world 
      use and evolution of these devices for other arrhythmias, cardiovascular diseases 
      and some of their risk factors beyond atrial fibrillation. The management of 
      nonatrial fibrillation arrhythmias represents a broad field of wearable 
      technologies in cardiology using Holter, event recorder, electrocardiogram (ECG) 
      patches, wristbands and textiles. Implementation in other patient cohorts, such 
      as ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), heart failure or sleep apnea, is 
      feasible and expanding. In addition to appropriate accuracy, clinical studies 
      must address the validation of clinical pathways including the appropriate device 
      and clinical decisions resulting from the surrogate assessed.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence: A Game-Changer for Mental Health Care.
PG  - 100-104
LID - 10.1089/cyber.2023.0723 [doi]
AB  - Starting from the escalating global burden of mental health disorders, 
      exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, the article examines the potential of 
      artificial intelligence (AI) to revolutionize mental health care. With nearly one 
      in five adults facing mental health issues and suicide ranking as a leading cause 
      of death among the young, the strained mental health system seeks innovative 
      solutions. The text discusses the rapid evolution of AI, particularly in image 
      analysis for early physical health diagnoses, and its promising applications in 
      mental health, including predictive analytics for various disorders. AI's ability 
      to analyze written language, speech characteristics, and physiological signals 
      from wearables offers avenues for remote monitoring and early prognosis. Despite 
      the need to address ethical considerations, particularly biases in data sets and 
      concerns about potential patient detachment, the article advocates for AI as a 
      complementary tool rather than a replacement for human involvement in mental 
      health services. Overall, the article emphasizes the transformative potential of 
      AI in enhancing diagnostics, monitoring, and treatment strategies for mental 
      health disorders.

TI  - Artificial intelligence-enhanced patient evaluation: bridging art and science.
LID - ehae415 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/eurheartj/ehae415 [doi]
AB  - The advent of digital health and artificial intelligence (AI) has promised to 
      revolutionize clinical care, but real-world patient evaluation has yet to witness 
      transformative changes. As history taking and physical examination continue to 
      rely on long-established practices, a growing pipeline of AI-enhanced digital 
      tools may soon augment the traditional clinical encounter into a data-driven 
      process. This article presents an evidence-backed vision of how promising AI 
      applications may enhance traditional practices, streamlining tedious tasks while 
      elevating diverse data sources, including AI-enabled stethoscopes, cameras, and 
      wearable sensors, to platforms for personalized medicine and efficient care 
      delivery. Through the lens of traditional patient evaluation, we illustrate how 
      digital technologies may soon be interwoven into routine clinical workflows, 
      introducing a novel paradigm of longitudinal monitoring. Finally, we provide a 
      skeptic's view on the practical, ethical, and regulatory challenges that limit 
      the uptake of such technologies.

TI  - Wearable Activity Trackers in the Management of Rheumatic Diseases: Where Are We 
      in 2020?
LID - 10.3390/s20174797 [doi]
LID - 4797
AB  - In healthcare, physical activity can be monitored in two ways: self-monitoring by 
      the patient himself or external monitoring by health professionals. Regarding 
      self-monitoring, wearable activity trackers allow automated passive data 
      collection that educate and motivate patients. Wearing an activity tracker can 
      improve walking time by around 1500 steps per day. However, there are concerns 
      about measurement accuracy (e.g., lack of a common validation protocol or 
      measurement discrepancies between different devices). For external monitoring, 
      many innovative electronic tools are currently used in rheumatology to help 
      support physician time management, to reduce the burden on clinic time, and to 
      prioritize patients who may need further attention. In inflammatory arthritis, 
      such as rheumatoid arthritis, regular monitoring of patients to detect disease 
      flares improves outcomes. In a pilot study applying machine learning to activity 
      tracker steps, we showed that physical activity was strongly linked to disease 
      flares and that patterns of physical activity could be used to predict flares 
      with great accuracy, with a sensitivity and specificity above 95%. Thus, 
      automatic monitoring of steps may lead to improved disease control through 
      potential early identification of disease flares. However, activity trackers have 
      some limitations when applied to rheumatic patients, such as tracker adherence, 
      lack of clarity on long-term effectiveness, or the potential multiplicity of 
      trackers.

TI  - Non-invasive wearables for remote monitoring of HbA1c and glucose variability: 
      proof of concept.
LID - 10.1136/bmjdrc-2020-002027 [doi]
LID - e002027
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Diabetes prevalence continues to grow and there remains a 
      significant diagnostic gap in one-third of the US population that has 
      pre-diabetes. Innovative, practical strategies to improve monitoring of glycemic 
      health are desperately needed. In this proof-of-concept study, we explore the 
      relationship between non-invasive wearables and glycemic metrics and demonstrate 
      the feasibility of using non-invasive wearables to estimate glycemic metrics, 
      including hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and glucose variability metrics. RESEARCH DESIGN 
      AND METHODS: We recorded over 25 000 measurements from a continuous glucose 
      monitor (CGM) with simultaneous wrist-worn wearable (skin temperature, 
      electrodermal activity, heart rate, and accelerometry sensors) data over 
      8-10 days in 16 participants with normal glycemic state and pre-diabetes (HbA1c 
      5.2-6.4). We used data from the wearable to develop machine learning models to 
      predict HbA1c recorded on day 0 and glucose variability calculated from the CGM. 
      We tested the accuracy of the HbA1c model on a retrospective, external validation 
      cohort of 10 additional participants and compared results against CGM-based HbA1c 
      estimation models. RESULTS: A total of 250 days of data from 26 participants were 
      collected. Out of the 27 models of glucose variability metrics that we developed 
      using non-invasive wearables, 11 of the models achieved high accuracy (<10% mean 
      average per cent error, MAPE). Our HbA1c estimation model using non-invasive 
      wearables data achieved MAPE of 5.1% on an external validation cohort. The 
      ranking of wearable sensor's importance in estimating HbA1c was skin temperature 
      (33%), electrodermal activity (28%), accelerometry (25%), and heart rate (14%). 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the feasibility of using non-invasive 
      wearables to estimate glucose variability metrics and HbA1c for glycemic 
      monitoring and investigates the relationship between non-invasive wearables and 
      the glycemic metrics of glucose variability and HbA1c. The methods used in this 
      study can be used to inform future studies confirming the results of this 
      proof-of-concept study.

AB  - Smart healthcare monitoring systems are proliferating due to the Internet of 
      Things (IoT)-enabled portable medical devices. The IoT and deep learning in the 
      healthcare sector prevent diseases by evolving healthcare from face-to-face 
      consultation to telemedicine. To protect athletes' life from life-threatening 
      severe conditions and injuries in training and competitions, real-time monitoring 
      of physiological indicators is critical. In this research work, we present a deep 
      learning-based IoT-enabled real-time health monitoring system. The proposed 
      system uses wearable medical devices to measure vital signs and apply various 
      deep learning algorithms to extract valuable information. For this purpose, we 
      have taken Sanda athletes as our case study. The deep learning algorithms help 
      physicians properly analyze these athletes' conditions and offer the proper 
      medications to them, even if the doctors are away. The performance of the 
      proposed system is extensively evaluated using a cross-validation test by 
      considering various statistical-based performance measurement metrics. The 
      proposed system is considered an effective tool that diagnoses dreadful diseases 
      among the athletes, such as brain tumors, heart disease, cancer, etc. The 
      performance results of the proposed system are evaluated in terms of precision, 
      recall, AUC, and F1, respectively.

AB  - While COVID-19 is still ongoing and associated with more than 5 million deaths, 
      the scope and speed of advances over the past year in terms of scientific 
      discovery, data dissemination, and technology have been staggering. It is not a 
      matter of "if" but "when" we will face the next pandemic, and how we leverage 
      technology and data management effectively to create flexible ecosystems that 
      facilitate collaboration, equitable care, and innovation will determine its 
      severity and scale. The aim of this review is to address emerging challenges that 
      came to light during the pandemic in health care and innovations that enabled us 
      to adapt and continue to care for patients. The pandemic highlighted the need for 
      seismic shifts in care paradigms and technology with considerations related to 
      the digital divide and health literacy for digital health interventions to reach 
      full potential and improve health outcomes. We discuss advances in telemedicine, 
      remote patient monitoring, and emerging wearable technologies. Despite the 
      promise of digital health, we emphasise the importance of addressing its 
      limitations, including interpretation challenges, accuracy of findings, and 
      artificial intelligence-driven algorithms. We summarise the most recent 
      recommendation of the Virtual Care Task Force to scaling virtual medical services 
      in Canada. Finally, we propose a model for optimal implementation of health 
      digital innovations with 5 tenets including data management, data security, 
      digital biomarkers, useful artificial intelligence, and clinical integration.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption of innovative healthcare 
      methods, including remote patient monitoring. In the setting of limited 
      healthcare resources, outpatient management of individuals newly diagnosed with 
      COVID-19 was commonly implemented, some taking advantage of various personal 
      health technologies, but only rarely using a multi-parameter chest-patch for 
      continuous monitoring. Here we describe the development and validation of a 
      COVID-19 decompensation index (CDI) model based on chest patch-derived continuous 
      sensor data to predict COVID-19 hospitalizations in outpatient-managed COVID-19 
      positive individuals, achieving an overall AUC of the ROC Curve of 0.84 on 308 
      event negative participants, and 22 event positive participants, out of an 
      overall study cohort of 400 participants. We retrospectively compare the 
      performance of CDI to standard of care modalities, finding that the machine 
      learning model outperforms the standard of care modalities in terms of both 
      numbers of events identified and with a lower false alarm rate. While only a 
      pilot phase study, the CDI represents a promising application of machine learning 
      within a continuous remote patient monitoring system.

AB  - eHealth is the use of modern information and communication technology (ICT) for 
      trans-institutional healthcare purposes. Important subtopics of eHealth are 
      health data sharing and telemedicine. Most of the clinical documentation to be 
      shared is collected in patient records to support patient care. More 
      sophisticated approaches to electronic patient records are trans-institutional or 
      (inter-)national. Other aims for clinical documentation are quality management, 
      reimbursement, legal issues, and medical research. Basic prerequisite for eHealth 
      is interoperability, which can be divided into technical, semantic and process 
      interoperability. There is a variety of international standards to support 
      interoperability. Telemedicine is a subtopic of eHealth, which bridges spatial 
      distance by using ICT for medical (inter-)actions. We distinguish telemedicine 
      among healthcare professionals and telemedicine between health care professionals 
      and patients. Both have a great potential to face the challenges of aging 
      societies, the increasing number of chronically ill patients, multimorbidity and 
      low number of physicians in remote areas. With ongoing digitalization more and 
      more data are available digitally. Clinical documentation is an important source 
      for big data analysis and artificial intelligence. The patient has an important 
      role: Telemonitoring, wearable technologies, and smart home devices provide 
      digital health data from daily life. These are high-quality data which can be 
      used for medical decisions.

TI  - Classification of Patient Recovery from COVID-19 Symptoms using Consumer 
      Wearables and Machine Learning.
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2023.3239366 [doi]
AB  - Current remote monitoring of COVID-19 patients relies on manual symptom 
      reporting, which is highly dependent on patient compliance. In this research, we 
      present a machine learning (ML)-based remote monitoring method to estimate 
      patient recovery from COVID-19 symptoms using automatically collected wearable 
      device data, instead of relying on manually collected symptom data. We deploy our 
      remote monitoring system, namely eCOVID, in two COVID-19 telemedicine clinics. 
      Our system utilizes a Garmin wearable and symptom tracker mobile app for data 
      collection. The data consists of vitals, lifestyle, and symptom information which 
      is fused into an online report for clinicians to review. Symptom data collected 
      via our mobile app is used to label the recovery status of each patient daily. We 
      propose a ML-based binary patient recovery classifier which uses wearable data to 
      estimate whether a patient has recovered from COVID-19 symptoms. We evaluate our 
      method using leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation, and find that Random 
      Forest (RF) is the top performing model. Our method achieves an F1-score of 0.88 
      when applying our RF-based model personalization technique using weighted 
      bootstrap aggregation. Our results demonstrate that ML-assisted remote monitoring 
      using automatically collected wearable data can supplement or be used in place of 
      manual daily symptom tracking which relies on patient compliance.

AB  - As the burgeoning field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to permeate the 
      fabric of healthcare, particularly in the realms of patient surveillance and 
      telemedicine, a transformative era beckons. This manuscript endeavors to unravel 
      the intricacies of recent AI advancements and their profound implications for 
      reconceptualizing the delivery of medical care. Through the introduction of 
      innovative instruments such as virtual assistant chatbots, wearable monitoring 
      devices, predictive analytic models, personalized treatment regimens, and 
      automated appointment systems, AI is not only amplifying the quality of care but 
      also empowering patients and fostering a more interactive dynamic between the 
      patient and the healthcare provider. Yet, this progressive infiltration of AI 
      into the healthcare sphere grapples with a plethora of challenges hitherto 
      unseen. The exigent issues of data security and privacy, the specter of 
      algorithmic bias, the requisite adaptability of regulatory frameworks, and the 
      matter of patient acceptance and trust in AI solutions demand immediate and 
      thoughtful resolution .The importance of establishing stringent and far-reaching 
      policies, ensuring technological impartiality, and cultivating patient confidence 
      is paramount to ensure that AI-driven enhancements in healthcare service 
      provision remain both ethically sound and efficient. In conclusion, we advocate 
      for an expansion of research efforts aimed at navigating the ethical complexities 
      inherent to a technology-evolving landscape, catalyzing policy innovation, and 
      devising AI applications that are not only clinically effective but also earn the 
      trust of the patient populace. By melding expertise across disciplines, we stand 
      at the threshold of an era wherein AI's role in healthcare is both ethically 
      unimpeachable and conducive to elevating the global health quotient.

AB  - COVID-19 exerts deleterious cardiopulmonary effects, leading to a worse prognosis 
      in the most affected. This retrospective multi-center observational cohort study 
      aimed to analyze the trajectories of key vitals amongst hospitalized COVID-19 
      patients using a chest-patch wearable providing continuous remote patient 
      monitoring of numerous vital signs. The study was conducted in five COVID-19 
      isolation units. A total of 492 COVID-19 patients were included in the final 
      analysis. Physiological parameters were measured every 15 min. More than 3 
      million measurements were collected including heart rate, systolic and diastolic 
      blood pressure, cardiac output, cardiac index, systemic vascular resistance, 
      respiratory rate, blood oxygen saturation, and body temperature. Cardiovascular 
      deterioration appeared early after admission and in parallel with changes in the 
      respiratory parameters, showing a significant difference in trajectories within 
      sub-populations at high risk. Early detection of cardiovascular deterioration of 
      COVID-19 patients is achievable when using frequent remote patient monitoring.

AB  - Direct-to-consumer (D2C) wearables are becoming increasingly popular in 
      cardiovascular health management because of their affordability and capability to 
      capture diverse health data. Wearables may enable continuous health care 
      provider-patient partnerships and reduce the volume of episodic clinic-based care 
      (thereby reducing health care costs). However, challenges arise from the 
      unregulated use of these devices, including questionable data reliability, 
      potential misinterpretation of information, unintended psychological impacts, and 
      an influx of clinically nonactionable data that may overburden the health care 
      system. Further, these technologies could exacerbate, rather than mitigate, 
      health disparities. Experience with wearables in atrial fibrillation underscores 
      these challenges. The prevalent use of D2C wearables necessitates a collaborative 
      approach among stakeholders to ensure effective integration into cardiovascular 
      care. Wearables are heralding innovative disease screening, diagnosis, and 
      management paradigms, expanding therapeutic avenues, and anchoring personalized 
      medicine.

      with Heart Failure.
PG  - 75-108
LID - 10.1007/s11897-022-00548-z [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In this article, we review a range of digital technologies for 
      possible application in heart failure patients, with a focus on lessons learned. 
      We also discuss a future model of heart failure management, as digital 
      technologies continue to become part of standard care. RECENT FINDINGS: Digital 
      technologies are increasingly used by healthcare professionals and those living 
      with heart failure to support more personalised and timely shared 
      decision-making, earlier identification of problems, and an improved experience 
      of care. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the acceptability and 
      implementation of a range of digital technologies, including remote monitoring 
      and health tracking, mobile health (wearable technology and smartphone-based 
      applications), and the use of machine learning to augment data interpretation and 
      decision-making. Much has been learned over recent decades on the challenges and 
      opportunities of technology development, including how best to evaluate the 
      impact of digital health interventions on health and healthcare, the human 
      factors involved in implementation and how best to integrate dataflows into the 
      clinical pathway. Supporting patients with heart failure as well as healthcare 
      professionals (both with a broad range of health and digital literacy skills) is 
      crucial to success. Access to digital technologies and the internet remains a 
      challenge for some patients. The aim should be to identify the right technology 
      for the right patient at the right time, in a process of co-design and 
      co-implementation with patients.

TI  - Recent Development of Flexible Tactile Sensors and Their Applications.
LID - 10.3390/s22010050 [doi]
LID - 50
AB  - With the rapid development of society in recent decades, the wearable sensor has 
      attracted attention for motion-based health care and artificial applications. 
      However, there are still many limitations to applying them in real life, 
      particularly the inconvenience that comes from their large size and non-flexible 
      systems. To solve these problems, flexible small-sized sensors that use body 
      motion as a stimulus are studied to directly collect more accurate and diverse 
      signals. In particular, tactile sensors are applied directly on the skin and 
      provide input signals of motion change for the flexible reading device. This 
      review provides information about different types of tactile sensors and their 
      working mechanisms that are piezoresistive, piezocapacitive, piezoelectric, and 
      triboelectric. Moreover, this review presents not only the applications of the 
      tactile sensor in motion sensing and health care monitoring, but also their 
      contributions in the field of artificial intelligence in recent years. Other 
      applications, such as human behavior studies, are also suggested.

AB  - Digital technologies have emerged in various dimensions of human life, ranging 
      from education to professional services to well-being. In particular, health 
      products and services have expanded by the use and development of artificial 
      intelligence, mobile health applications, and wearable electronic devices. Such 
      advancements have enabled accurate and updated tracking and modeling of health 
      conditions. For instance, digital health technologies are capable of measuring 
      environmental pollution and predicting its adverse health effects. Several health 
      conditions, including chronic airway diseases such as asthma and chronic 
      obstructive pulmonary disease, can be exacerbated by pollution. These diseases 
      impose substantial health burdens with high morbidity and mortality. Recently, 
      efforts have been made to develop digital technologies to alleviate such 
      conditions. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has facilitated the application of 
      telemedicine and telemonitoring for patients with chronic airway diseases. This 
      article reviews current trends and studies in digital technology utilization for 
      investigating and managing environmental exposure and chronic airway diseases. 
      First, we discussed the recent progression of digital technologies in general 
      environmental healthcare. Then, we summarized the capacity of digital 
      technologies in predicting exacerbation and self-management of airway diseases. 
      Concluding these reviews, we provided suggestions to improve digital health 
      technologies' abilities to reduce the adverse effects of environmental exposure 
      in chronic airway diseases, based on personal exposure-response modeling.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent advances in digital pathology have enabled accurate and 
      standardised enumeration of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Here, we aim 
      to evaluate TILs as a percentage electronic TIL score (eTILs) and investigate its 
      prognostic and predictive relevance in cutaneous melanoma. METHODS: We included 
      stage I to IV cutaneous melanoma patients and used hematoxylin-eosin-stained 
      slides for TIL analysis. We assessed eTILs as a continuous and categorical 
      variable using the published cut-off of 16.6% and applied Cox regression models 
      to evaluate associations of eTILs with relapse-free, distant metastasis-free, and 
      overall survival. We compared eTILs of the primaries with matched metastasis. 
      Moreover, we assessed the predictive relevance of eTILs in therapy-naïve 
      metastases according to the first-line therapy. FINDINGS: We analysed 321 primary 
      cutaneous melanomas and 191 metastatic samples. In simple Cox regression, tumour 
      thickness (p < 0.0001), presence of ulceration (p = 0.0001) and eTILs ≤16.6% 
      (p = 0.0012) were found to be significant unfavourable prognostic factors for 
      RFS. In multiple Cox regression, eTILs ≤16.6% (p = 0.0161) remained significant 
      and downgraded the current staging. Lower eTILs in the primary tissue was 
      associated with unfavourable relapse-free (p = 0.0014) and distant 
      metastasis-free survival (p = 0.0056). In multiple Cox regression adjusted for 
      tumour thickness and ulceration, eTILs as continuous remained significant 
      (p = 0.019). When comparing TILs in primary tissue and corresponding metastasis 
      of the same patient, eTILs in metastases was lower than in primary melanomas 
      (p < 0.0001). In therapy-naïve metastases, an eTILs >12.2% was associated with 
      longer progression-free survival (p = 0.037) and melanoma-specific survival 
      (p = 0.0038) in patients treated with anti-PD-1-based immunotherapy. In multiple 
      Cox regression, lactate dehydrogenase (p < 0.0001) and eTILs ≤12.2% (p = 0.0130) 
      were significantly associated with unfavourable melanoma-specific survival. 
      INTERPRETATION: Assessment of TILs is prognostic in primary melanoma samples, and 
      the eTILs complements staging. In therapy-naïve metastases, eTILs ≤12.2% is 
      predictive of unfavourable survival outcomes in patients receiving 
      anti-PD-1-based therapy. FUNDING: See a detailed list of funding bodies in the

TI  - Machine Learning-Based Aggression Detection in Children with ADHD Using 
      Sensor-Based Physical Activity Monitoring.
LID - 10.3390/s23104949 [doi]
LID - 4949
AB  - Aggression in children is highly prevalent and can have devastating consequences, 
      yet there is currently no objective method to track its frequency in daily life. 
      This study aims to investigate the use of wearable-sensor-derived physical 
      activity data and machine learning to objectively identify physical-aggressive 
      incidents in children. Participants (n = 39) aged 7 to 16 years, with and without 
      ADHD, wore a waist-worn activity monitor (ActiGraph, GT3X+) for up to one week, 
      three times over 12 months, while demographic, anthropometric, and clinical data 
      were collected. Machine learning techniques, specifically random forest, were 
      used to analyze patterns that identify physical-aggressive incident with 1-min 
      time resolution. A total of 119 aggression episodes, lasting 7.3 ± 13.1 min for a 
      total of 872 1-min epochs including 132 physical aggression epochs, were 
      collected. The model achieved high precision (80.2%), accuracy (82.0%), recall 
      (85.0%), F1 score (82.4%), and area under the curve (89.3%) to distinguish 
      physical aggression epochs. The sensor-derived feature of vector magnitude 
      (faster triaxial acceleration) was the second contributing feature in the model, 
      and significantly distinguished aggression and non-aggression epochs. If 
      validated in larger samples, this model could provide a practical and efficient 
      solution for remotely detecting and managing aggressive incidents in children.

AB  - Wearable technology is an emerging method for the early detection of coronavirus 
      disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. This scoping review explored the types, 
      mechanisms, and accuracy of wearable technology for the early detection of 
      COVID-19. This review was conducted according to the five-step framework of 
      Arksey and O'Malley. Studies published between December 31, 2019 and December 15, 
      2021 were obtained from 10 electronic databases, namely, PubMed, Embase, 
      Cochrane, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ProQuest, Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and 
      Taylor & Francis Online. Grey literature, reference lists, and key journals were 
      also searched. All types of articles describing wearable technology for the 
      detection of COVID-19 infection were included. Two reviewers independently 
      screened the articles against the eligibility criteria and extracted the data 
      using a data charting form. A total of 40 articles were included in this review. 
      There are 22 different types of wearable technology used to detect COVID-19 
      infections early in the existing literature and are categorized as smartwatches 
      or fitness trackers (67%), medical devices (27%), or others (6%). Based on 
      deviations in physiological characteristics, anomaly detection models that can 
      detect COVID-19 infection early were built using artificial intelligence or 
      statistical analysis techniques. Reported area-under-the-curve values ranged from 
      75% to 94.4%, and sensitivity and specificity values ranged from 36.5% to 100% 
      and 73% to 95.3%, respectively. Further research is necessary to validate the 
      effectiveness and clinical dependability of wearable technology before healthcare 
      policymakers can mandate its use for remote surveillance.

AB  - Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 may deteriorate rapidly and therefore 
      continuous monitoring is necessary. We conducted an observational study involving 
      patients with mild COVID-19 to explore the potentials of wearable biosensors and 
      machine learning-based analysis of physiology parameters to detect clinical 
      deterioration. Thirty-four patients (median age: 32 years; male: 52.9%) with mild 
      COVID-19 from Queen Mary Hospital were recruited. The mean National Early Warning 
      Score 2 (NEWS2) were 0.59 ± 0.7. 1231 manual measurement of physiology parameters 
      were performed during hospital stay (median 15 days). Physiology parameters 
      obtained from wearable biosensors correlated well with manual measurement 
      including pulse rate (r = 0.96, p < 0.0001) and oxygen saturation (r = 0.87, 
      p < 0.0001). A machine learning-derived index reflecting overall health status, 
      Biovitals Index (BI), was generated by autonomous analysis of physiology 
      parameters, symptoms, and other medical data. Daily BI was linearly associated 
      with respiratory tract viral load (p < 0.0001) and NEWS2 (r = 0.75, p < 0.001). 
      BI was superior to NEWS2 in predicting clinical worsening events (sensitivity 
      94.1% and specificity 88.9%) and prolonged hospitalization (sensitivity 66.7% and 
      specificity 72.7%). Wearable biosensors coupled with machine learning-derived 
      health index allowed automated detection of clinical deterioration.

AB  - Heart rate at rest and exercise may predict cardiovascular risk. Heart rate 
      variability is a measure of variation in time between each heartbeat, 
      representing the balance between the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous 
      system and may predict adverse cardiovascular events. With advances in technology 
      and increasing commercial interest, the scope of remote monitoring health systems 
      has expanded. In this review, we discuss the concepts behind cardiac signal 
      generation and recording, wearable devices, pros and cons focusing on accuracy, 
      ease of application of commercial and medical grade diagnostic devices, which 
      showed promising results in terms of reliability and value. Incorporation of 
      artificial intelligence and cloud based remote monitoring have been evolving to 
      facilitate timely data processing, improve patient convenience and ensure data 
      security.

TI  - Continuous Remote Patient Monitoring: Evaluation of the Heart Failure Cascade 
      Soft Launch.
PG  - 1161-1173
LID - 10.1055/s-0041-1740480 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We report on our experience of deploying a continuous remote patient 
      monitoring (CRPM) study soft launch with structured cascading and escalation 
      pathways on heart failure (HF) patients post-discharge. The lessons learned from 
      the soft launch are used to modify and fine-tune the workflow process and study 
      protocol. METHODS: This soft launch was conducted at NorthShore University 
      HealthSystem's Evanston Hospital from December 2020 to March 2021. Patients were 
      provided with non-invasive wearable biosensors that continuously collect 
      ambulatory physiological data, and a study phone that collects patient-reported 
      outcomes. The physiological data are analyzed by machine learning algorithms, 
      potentially identifying physiological perturbation in HF patients. Alerts from 
      this algorithm may be cascaded with other patient status data to inform home 
      health nurses' (HHNs') management via a structured protocol. HHNs review the 
      monitoring platform daily. If the patient's status meets specific criteria, HHNs 
      perform assessments and escalate patient cases to the HF team for further 
      guidance on early intervention. RESULTS: We enrolled five patients into the soft 
      launch. Four participants adhered to study activities. Two out of five patients 
      were readmitted, one due to HF, one due to infection. Observed miscommunication 
      and protocol gaps were noted for protocol amendment. The study team adopted an 
      organizational development method from change management theory to reconfigure 
      the study protocol. CONCLUSION: We sought to automate the monitoring aspects of 
      post-discharge care by aligning a new technology that generates streaming data 
      from a wearable device with a complex, multi-provider workflow into a novel 
      protocol using iterative design, implementation, and evaluation methods to 
      monitor post-discharge HF patients. CRPM with structured escalation and 
      telemonitoring protocol shows potential to maintain patients in their home 
      environment and reduce HF-related readmissions. Our results suggest that further 
      education to engage and empower frontline workers using advanced technology is 
      essential to scale up the approach.

TI  - Mathematical Framework for Wearable Devices in the Internet of Things Using Deep 
      Learning.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics12112750 [doi]
LID - 2750
AB  - To avoid dire situations, the medical sector must develop various methods for 
      quickly and accurately identifying infections in remote regions. The primary goal 
      of the proposed work is to create a wearable device that uses the Internet of 
      Things (IoT) to carry out several monitoring tasks. To decrease the amount of 
      communication loss as well as the amount of time required to wait before 
      detection and improve detection quality, the designed wearable device is also 
      operated with a multi-objective framework. Additionally, a design method for 
      wearable IoT devices is established, utilizing distinct mathematical approaches 
      to solve these objectives. As a result, the monitored parametric values are saved 
      in a different IoT application platform. Since the proposed study focuses on a 
      multi-objective framework, state design and deep learning (DL) optimization 
      techniques are combined, reducing the complexity of detection in wearable 
      technology. Wearable devices with IoT processes have even been included in 
      current methods. However, a solution cannot be duplicated using mathematical 
      approaches and optimization strategies. Therefore, developed wearable gadgets can 
      be applied to real-time medical applications for fast remote monitoring of an 
      individual. Additionally, the proposed technique is tested in real-time, and an 
      IoT simulation tool is utilized to track the compared experimental results under 
      five different situations. In all of the case studies that were examined, the 
      planned method performs better than the current state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - The Evaluation of Remote Monitoring Technology Across Participants With Different 
      Skin Tones.
PG  - e45075
LID - 10.7759/cureus.45075 [doi]
LID - e45075
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many research studies seek to improve vital sign monitoring to 
      enhance the conditions under which doctors and caregivers track patients' health. 
      Non-invasive and contactless monitoring has emerged as an optimal solution for 
      this problem, with telemedicine, self-monitoring, and well-being tools being the 
      next generation of technology in the biomedical field. However, there is 
      worldwide concern about the general purpose and bias toward a certain demographic 
      group of these techniques. In particular, skin tone and the accuracy of 
      monitoring dark skin tone groups have been key questions among researchers, with 
      the lack of results and studies contributing to this uncertainty. METHODS: This 
      paper proposes a benchmark for remote monitoring solutions against a medical 
      device across different skin tone people. Around 330 videos from 90 patients were 
      analyzed, and heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) were compared 
      across different subgroups. The Fitzpatrick scale (1-6) was used to classify 
      participants into three skin tone groups: 1 and 2, 3 and 4, and 5 and 6. RESULTS: 
      The results showed that our proposed methodology could estimate heart rate with a 
      mean absolute error of 3 bpm across all samples and subgroups. Moreover, for 
      heart rate variability (HRV) metrics, we achieved the following results: in terms 
      of mobility assistive equipment (MAE), the HRV-inter-beat interval (IBI) was 10 
      ms, the HRV-standard deviation of normal to normal heartbeats (SDNN) was 14 ms, 
      and the HRV-root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) between normal 
      heartbeats was 22 ms. No significant performance decrease was found for any skin 
      tone group, and there was no error trend toward a certain group. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      study showed that our methodology meets acceptable agreement levels for the 
      proposed metrics. Furthermore, the experiments showed that skin tone did not 
      impact the results, which remained within the same range across all groups. 
      Moreover, it enables the end users to understand their general well-being and 
      improve their overall health.

TI  - Applications of Federated Learning in Mobile Health: Scoping Review.
PG  - e43006
LID - 10.2196/43006 [doi]
LID - e43006
AB  - BACKGROUND: The proliferation of mobile health (mHealth) applications is partly 
      driven by the advancements in sensing and communication technologies, as well as 
      the integration of artificial intelligence techniques. Data collected from 
      mHealth applications, for example, on sensor devices carried by patients, can be 
      mined and analyzed using artificial intelligence-based solutions to facilitate 
      remote and (near) real-time decision-making in health care settings. However, 
      such data often sit in data silos, and patients are often concerned about the 
      privacy implications of sharing their raw data. Federated learning (FL) is a 
      potential solution, as it allows multiple data owners to collaboratively train a 
      machine learning model without requiring access to each other's raw data. 
      OBJECTIVE: The goal of this scoping review is to gain an understanding of FL and 
      its potential in dealing with sensitive and heterogeneous data in mHealth 
      applications. Through this review, various stakeholders, such as health care 
      providers, practitioners, and policy makers, can gain insight into the 
      limitations and challenges associated with using FL in mHealth and make informed 
      decisions when considering implementing FL-based solutions. METHODS: We conducted 
      a scoping review following the guidelines of PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting 
      Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews). We 
      searched 7 commonly used databases. The included studies were analyzed and 
      summarized to identify the possible real-world applications and associated 
      challenges of using FL in mHealth settings. RESULTS: A total of 1095 articles 
      were retrieved during the database search, and 26 articles that met the inclusion 
      criteria were included in the review. The analysis of these articles revealed 2 
      main application areas for FL in mHealth, that is, remote monitoring and 
      diagnostic and treatment support. More specifically, FL was found to be commonly 
      used for monitoring self-care ability, health status, and disease progression, as 
      well as in diagnosis and treatment support of diseases. The review also 
      identified several challenges (eg, expensive communication, statistical 
      heterogeneity, and system heterogeneity) and potential solutions (eg, compression 
      schemes, model personalization, and active sampling). CONCLUSIONS: This scoping 
      review has highlighted the potential of FL as a privacy-preserving approach in 
      mHealth applications and identified the technical limitations associated with its 
      use. The challenges and opportunities outlined in this review can inform the 
      research agenda for future studies in this field, to overcome these limitations 
      and further advance the use of FL in mHealth.

AB  - Heart Failure (HF) is an important public health problem in Turkey and in the 
      world. Hospitalizations due to HF decompensation are associated with increased 
      mortality. The use of digital technologies, especially wearable technologies, is 
      increasing. As physicians, with the use of these devices, patients could be 
      closely followed up and hospitalization, mortality are tried to be prevented by 
      increased awareness of decomposition before clinical symptoms or at the beginning 
      of symptoms. In this review, digital biomarkers, digital technologies, remote 
      monitoring systems and the evidence supporting their use, artificial intelligence 
      applications and the reasons limiting their use of digital technologies in 
      clinical practice will be discussed.

AB  - Serious clinical complications (SCC; CTCAE grade ≥ 3) occur frequently in 
      patients treated for hematological malignancies. Early diagnosis and treatment of 
      SCC are essential to improve outcomes. Here we report a deep learning 
      model-derived SCC-Score to detect and predict SCC from time-series data recorded 
      continuously by a medical wearable. In this single-arm, single-center, 
      observational cohort study, vital signs and physical activity were recorded with 
      a wearable for 31,234 h in 79 patients (54 Inpatient Cohort (IC)/25 Outpatient 
      Cohort (OC)). Hours with normal physical functioning without evidence of SCC 
      (regular hours) were presented to a deep neural network that was trained by a 
      self-supervised contrastive learning objective to extract features from the time 
      series that are typical in regular periods. The model was used to calculate a 
      SCC-Score that measures the dissimilarity to regular features. Detection and 
      prediction performance of the SCC-Score was compared to clinical documentation of 
      SCC (AUROC ± SD). In total 124 clinically documented SCC occurred in the IC, 16 
      in the OC. Detection of SCC was achieved in the IC with a sensitivity of 79.7% 
      and specificity of 87.9%, with AUROC of 0.91 ± 0.01 (OC sensitivity 77.4%, 
      specificity 81.8%, AUROC 0.87 ± 0.02). Prediction of infectious SCC was possible 
      up to 2 days before clinical diagnosis (AUROC 0.90 at -24 h and 0.88 at -48 h). 
      We provide proof of principle for the detection and prediction of SCC in patients 
      treated for hematological malignancies using wearable data and a deep learning 
      model. As a consequence, remote patient monitoring may enable pre-emptive 
      complication management.

AB  - Patients with advanced heart failure, due to the instability of their clinical 
      conditions, need close surveillance to avoid dangerous exacerbations or sudden 
      events. Digital technology can be of great help in this contest, thanks to remote 
      monitoring, made possible with the use of wearable or implantable instruments. 
      The latter are currently generally inserted inside defibrillators or 
      resynchronization systems, or inserted inside the pulmonary circulation for 
      monitoring pulmonary pressure. Parameters such as thoracic impedance, physical 
      activity, heart rate variability, atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, blood 
      pressure, and O(2) saturation can be controlled remotely. The data relating to 
      the actual benefit in terms of avoidable events (death and hospitalizations) are 
      not definitive, but certainly from an organizational point of view, the benefit 
      is evident, both on the part of the patient and of the organization of care. The 
      latter, provided in the form of televisits, requires a re-modulation of the 
      system, making use of trained personnel, a well-structured network, and digital 
      technologies (platforms, electronic health records) that are not yet perfectly 
      developed. The evolution of the solutions offered by artificial intelligence 
      guarantees a rapid and progressive refinement of telemedicine in this sector.

      Monitoring.

AB  - Conventional electromagnetic (EM) sensing techniques such as radar and LiDAR are 
      widely used for remote sensing, vehicle applications, weather monitoring, and 
      clinical monitoring. Acoustic techniques such as sonar and ultrasound sensors are 
      also used for consumer applications, such as ranging and in vivo 
      medical/healthcare applications. It has been of long-term interest to doctors and 
      clinical practitioners to realize continuous healthcare monitoring in hospitals 
      and/or homes. Physiological and biopotential signals in real-time serve as 
      important health indicators to predict and prevent serious illness. Emerging 
      electromagnetic-acoustic (EMA) sensing techniques synergistically combine the 
      merits of EM sensing with acoustic imaging to achieve comprehensive detection of 
      physiological and biopotential signals. Further, EMA enables complementary fusion 
      sensing for challenging healthcare settings, such as real-world long-term 
      monitoring of treatment effects at home or in remote environments. This article 
      reviews various examples of EMA sensing instruments, including implementation, 
      performance, and application from the perspectives of circuits to systems. The 
      novel and significant applications to healthcare are discussed. Three types of 
      EMA sensors are presented: (1) Chip-based radar sensors for health status 
      monitoring, (2) Thermo-acoustic sensing instruments for biomedical applications, 
      and (3) Photoacoustic (PA) sensing and imaging systems, including dedicated 
      reconstruction algorithms were reviewed from time-domain, frequency-domain, 
      time-reversal, and model-based solutions. The future of EMA techniques for 
      continuous healthcare with enhanced accuracy supported by artificial intelligence 
      (AI) is also presented.

AB  - Telehealth and remote patient monitoring (RPM) have been critical components that 
      have received substantial attention and gained hold since the pandemic's 
      beginning. Telehealth and RPM allow easy access to patient data and help provide 
      high-quality care to patients at a low cost. This article proposes an Intelligent 
      Remote Patient Activity Tracking System system that can monitor patient 
      activities and vitals during those activities based on the attached sensors. An 
      Internet of Things- (IoT-) enabled health monitoring device is designed using 
      machine learning models to track patient's activities such as running, sleeping, 
      walking, and exercising, the vitals during those activities such as body 
      temperature and heart rate, and the patient's breathing pattern during such 
      activities. Machine learning models are used to identify different activities of 
      the patient and analyze the patient's respiratory health during various 
      activities. Currently, the machine learning models are used to detect cough and 
      healthy breathing only. A web application is also designed to track the data 
      uploaded by the proposed devices.

TI  - Conductive, self-healing, and antibacterial Ag/MXene-PVA hydrogel as wearable 
      skin-like sensors.
PG  - 1169-1181
LID - 10.1177/08853282221131137 [doi]
AB  - The rapid development of flexible electronic technology has led to the in-depth 
      study of flexible wearable sensors to achieve accurate sensing under different 
      external stimuli. However, it is still a huge challenge to develop hydrogel-based 
      wearable skin-like sensors with super ductility, high sensitivity, and 
      self-healing properties. Herein, the Ti(3)C(2) type of MXene was synthesized, and 
      the Ag/MXene nanocomplexes were incorporated into polyvinyl alcohol-borax matrix 
      to construct a novel composite hydrogel as the multifunctional nanofillers, which 
      could bring both improved properties and novel functionalities. The Ag/MXene-Poly 
      (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogel displayed integrated merits of highly strain 
      sensitive (GF = 3.26), self-healing (within 10 min, 91% healing efficiency), and 
      excellent antibacterial activity. The hydrogel could be assembled into a wearable 
      skin-like sensor to monitor human movement, including large deformations (finger, 
      elbow, wrist, and knee bending) and tiny deformations (mouth's movement and 
      throat vocalization) in real time. Therefore, this work shed a new light on the 
      development of flexible wearable skin-like sensors for the personalized 
      healthcare monitoring, human-machine interfaces, and artificial intelligence.

TI  - Automated Detection of Hypertension Using Physiological Signals: A Review.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18115838 [doi]
LID - 5838
AB  - Arterial hypertension (HT) is a chronic condition of elevated blood pressure 
      (BP), which may cause increased incidence of cardiovascular disease, stroke, 
      kidney failure and mortality. If the HT is diagnosed early, effective treatment 
      can control the BP and avert adverse outcomes. Physiological signals like 
      electrocardiography (ECG), photoplethysmography (PPG), heart rate variability 
      (HRV), and ballistocardiography (BCG) can be used to monitor health status but 
      are not directly correlated with BP measurements. The manual detection of HT 
      using these physiological signals is time consuming and prone to human errors. 
      Hence, many computer-aided diagnosis systems have been developed. This paper is a 
      systematic review of studies conducted on the automated detection of HT using 
      ECG, HRV, PPG and BCG signals. In this review, we have identified 23 studies out 
      of 250 screened papers, which fulfilled our eligibility criteria. Details of the 
      study methods, physiological signal studied, database used, various nonlinear 
      techniques employed, feature extraction, and diagnostic performance parameters 
      are discussed. The machine learning and deep learning based methods based on ECG 
      and HRV signals have yielded the best performance and can be used for the 
      development of computer-aided diagnosis of HT. This work provides insights that 
      may be useful for the development of wearable for continuous cuffless remote 
      monitoring of BP based on ECG and HRV signals.

TI  - Real-Time Learning and Monitoring System in Fighting against SARS-CoV-2 in a 
      Private Indoor Environment.
LID - 10.3390/s22187001 [doi]
LID - 7001
AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 virus has posed formidable challenges that must be tackled through 
      scientific and technological investigations on each environmental scale. This 
      research aims to learn and report about the current state of user activities, in 
      real-time, in a specially designed private indoor environment with sensors in 
      infection transmission control of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, a real-time learning system 
      that evolves and updates with each incoming piece of data from the environment is 
      developed to predict user activities categorized for remote monitoring. 
      Accordingly, various experiments are conducted in the private indoor space. 
      Multiple sensors, with their inputs, are analyzed through the experiments. The 
      experiment environment, installed with microgrids and Internet of Things (IoT) 
      devices, has provided correlating data of various sensors from that special care 
      context during the pandemic. The data is applied to classify user activities and 
      develop a real-time learning and monitoring system to predict the IoT data. The 
      microgrids were operated with the real-time learning system developed by 
      comprehensive experiments on classification learning, regression learning, 
      Error-Correcting Output Codes (ECOC), and deep learning models. With the help of 
      machine learning experiments, data optimization, and the multilayered-tandem 
      organization of the developed neural networks, the efficiency of this real-time 
      monitoring system increases in learning the activity of users and predicting 
      their actions, which are reported as feedback on the monitoring interfaces. The 
      developed learning system predicts the real-time IoT data, accurately, in less 
      than 5 milliseconds and generates big data that can be deployed for different 
      usages in larger-scale facilities, networks, and e-health services.

TI  - Wearable-Based Stair Climb Power Estimation and Activity Classification.
LID - 10.3390/s22176600 [doi]
LID - 6600
AB  - Stair climb power (SCP) is a clinical measure of leg muscular function assessed 
      in-clinic via the Stair Climb Power Test (SCPT). This method is subject to human 
      error and cannot provide continuous remote monitoring. Continuous monitoring 
      using wearable sensors may provide a more comprehensive assessment of lower-limb 
      muscular function. In this work, we propose an algorithm to classify stair 
      climbing periods and estimate SCP from a lower-back worn accelerometer, which 
      strongly agrees with the clinical standard (r = 0.92, p < 0.001; ICC = 0.90, 
      [0.82, 0.94]). Data were collected in-lab from healthy adults (n = 65) performing 
      the four-step SCPT and a walking assessment while instrumented (accelerometer + 
      gyroscope), which allowed us to investigate tradeoffs between sensor modalities. 
      Using two classifiers, we were able to identify periods of stair ascent with >89% 
      accuracy [sensitivity = >0.89, specificity = >0.90] using two ensemble machine 
      learning algorithms, trained on accelerometer signal features. Minimal changes in 
      model performances were observed using the gyroscope alone (±0−6% accuracy) 
      versus the accelerometer model. While we observed a slight increase in accuracy 
      when combining gyroscope and accelerometer (about +3−6% accuracy), this is 
      tolerable to preserve battery life in the at-home environment. This work is 
      impactful as it shows potential for an accelerometer-based at-home assessment of 
      SCP.

TI  - Deep Learning-Based IoT System for Remote Monitoring and Early Detection of 
      Health Issues in Real-Time.
LID - 10.3390/s23115204 [doi]
LID - 5204
AB  - With an aging population and increased chronic diseases, remote health monitoring 
      has become critical to improving patient care and reducing healthcare costs. The 
      Internet of Things (IoT) has recently drawn much interest as a potential remote 
      health monitoring remedy. IoT-based systems can gather and analyze a wide range 
      of physiological data, including blood oxygen levels, heart rates, body 
      temperatures, and ECG signals, and then provide real-time feedback to medical 
      professionals so they may take appropriate action. This paper proposes an 
      IoT-based system for remote monitoring and early detection of health problems in 
      home clinical settings. The system comprises three sensor types: MAX30100 for 
      measuring blood oxygen level and heart rate; AD8232 ECG sensor module for ECG 
      signal data; and MLX90614 non-contact infrared sensor for body temperature. The 
      collected data is transmitted to a server using the MQTT protocol. A pre-trained 
      deep learning model based on a convolutional neural network with an attention 
      layer is used on the server to classify potential diseases. The system can detect 
      five different categories of heartbeats: Normal Beat, Supraventricular premature 
      beat, Premature ventricular contraction, Fusion of ventricular, and 
      Unclassifiable beat from ECG sensor data and fever or non-fever from body 
      temperature. Furthermore, the system provides a report on the patient's heart 
      rate and oxygen level, indicating whether they are within normal ranges or not. 
      The system automatically connects the user to the nearest doctor for further 
      diagnosis if any critical abnormalities are detected.

TI  - Machine Learning Techniques for Developing Remotely Monitored Central Nervous 
      System Biomarkers Using Wearable Sensors: A Narrative Literature Review.
LID - 10.3390/s23115243 [doi]
LID - 5243
AB  - BACKGROUND: Central nervous system (CNS) disorders benefit from ongoing 
      monitoring to assess disease progression and treatment efficacy. Mobile health 
      (mHealth) technologies offer a means for the remote and continuous symptom 
      monitoring of patients. Machine Learning (ML) techniques can process and engineer 
      mHealth data into a precise and multidimensional biomarker of disease activity. 
      OBJECTIVE: This narrative literature review aims to provide an overview of the 
      current landscape of biomarker development using mHealth technologies and ML. 
      Additionally, it proposes recommendations to ensure the accuracy, reliability, 
      and interpretability of these biomarkers. METHODS: This review extracted relevant 
      publications from databases such as PubMed, IEEE, and CTTI. The ML methods 
      employed across the selected publications were then extracted, aggregated, and 
      reviewed. RESULTS: This review synthesized and presented the diverse approaches 
      of 66 publications that address creating mHealth-based biomarkers using ML. The 
      reviewed publications provide a foundation for effective biomarker development 
      and offer recommendations for creating representative, reproducible, and 
      interpretable biomarkers for future clinical trials. CONCLUSION: mHealth-based 
      and ML-derived biomarkers have great potential for the remote monitoring of CNS 
      disorders. However, further research and standardization of study designs are 
      needed to advance this field. With continued innovation, mHealth-based biomarkers 
      hold promise for improving the monitoring of CNS disorders.

TI  - An Intelligent Diabetic Patient Tracking System Based on Machine Learning for 
      E-Health Applications.
LID - 10.3390/s23063004 [doi]
LID - 3004
AB  - BACKGROUND: Continuous surveillance helps people with diabetes live better lives. 
      A wide range of technologies, including the Internet of Things (IoT), modern 
      communications, and artificial intelligence (AI), can assist in lowering the 
      expense of health services. Due to numerous communication systems, it is now 
      possible to provide customized and distant healthcare. MAIN PROBLEM: Healthcare 
      data grows daily, making storage and processing challenging. We provide 
      intelligent healthcare structures for smart e-health apps to solve the aforesaid 
      problem. The 5G network must offer advanced healthcare services to meet important 
      requirements like large bandwidth and excellent energy efficacy. METHODOLOGY: 
      This research suggested an intelligent system for diabetic patient tracking based 
      on machine learning (ML). The architectural components comprised smartphones, 
      sensors, and smart devices, to gather body dimensions. Then, the preprocessed 
      data is normalized using the normalization procedure. To extract features, we use 
      linear discriminant analysis (LDA). To establish a diagnosis, the intelligent 
      system conducted data classification utilizing the suggested 
      advanced-spatial-vector-based Random Forest (ASV-RF) in conjunction with particle 
      swarm optimization (PSO). RESULTS: Compared to other techniques, the simulation's 
      outcomes demonstrate that the suggested approach offers greater accuracy.

LID - 6256126
AB  - Pulse signal is one of the most important physiological features of human body, 
      which is caused by the cyclical contraction and diastole. It has great research 
      value and broad application prospect in the detection of physiological 
      parameters, the development of medical equipment, and the study of cardiovascular 
      diseases and pulse diagnosis objective. In recent years, with the development of 
      the sensor, measuring and saving of pulse signal has become very convenient. Now 
      the pulse signal feature analysis is a hotspot and difficulty in the signal 
      processing field. Therefore, to realize pulse signal automatic analysis and 
      recognition is vital significance in the aspects of the noninvasive diagnosis and 
      remote monitoring, etc. In this article, we combined the pulse signal feature 
      extraction in time and frequency domain and convolution neural network to analyze 
      the pulse signal. Firstly, a theory of wavelet transform and the ensemble 
      empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) which is gradually developed in recent years 
      have been used to remove the noises in the pulse signal. Moreover, a method of 
      feature point detection based on differential threshold method is proposed which 
      realized the accurate positioning and extraction time-domain values. Finally, a 
      deep learning method based on one-dimensional CNN has been utilized to make the 
      classification of multiple pulse signals in the article. In conclusion, a deep 
      learning method is proposed for the pulse signal classification combined with the 
      feature extraction in time and frequency domain in this article.

TI  - A Contact-Free Optical Device for the Detection of Pulmonary Congestion-A Pilot 
      Study.
LID - 10.3390/bios12100833 [doi]
LID - 833
AB  - BACKGROUND: The cost of heart failure hospitalizations in the US alone is over 
      USD 10 billion per year. Over 4 million Americans are hospitalized every year due 
      to heart failure (HF), with a median length of stay of 4 days and an in-hospital 
      mortality rate that exceeds 5%. Hospitalizations of patients with HF can be 
      prevented by early detection of lung congestion. Our study assessed a new 
      contact-free optical medical device used for the early detection of lung 
      congestion. METHODS: The Gili system is an FDA-cleared device used for measuring 
      chest motion vibration data. Lung congestion in the study was assessed clinically 
      and verified via two cardiologists. An algorithm was developed using machine 
      learning techniques, and cross-validation of the findings was performed to 
      estimate the accuracy of the algorithm. RESULTS: A total of 227 patients were 
      recruited (101 cases vs. 126 controls). The sensitivity and specificity for the 
      device in our study were 0.91 (95% CI: 0.86-0.93) and 0.91 (95% CI: 0.87-0.94), 
      respectively. In all instances, the observed estimates of PPVs and NPVs were at 
      least 0.82 and 0.90, respectively. The accuracy of the algorithm was not affected 
      by different covariates (including respiratory or valvular conditions). 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the efficacy of a contact-free optical 
      device for detecting lung congestion. Further validation of the study results 
      across a larger and precise scale is warranted.

TI  - Impact of artificial intelligence on prognosis, shared decision-making, and 
      precision medicine for patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a perspective 
      and expert opinion.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to impact all facets of 
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) management, including disease assessment, 
      treatment decisions, discovery and development of new biomarkers and 
      therapeutics, as well as clinician-patient communication. AREAS COVERED: This 
      perspective paper provides an overview of the application of AI in the clinical 
      management of IBD through a review of the currently available AI models that 
      could be potential tools for prognosis, shared decision-making, and precision 
      medicine. This overview covers models that measure treatment response based on 
      statistical or machine-learning methods, or a combination of the two. We briefly 
      discuss a computational model that allows integration of immune/biological system 
      knowledge with mathematical modeling and also involves a 'digital twin', which 
      allows measurement of temporal trends in mucosal inflammatory activity for 
      predicting treatment response. A viewpoint on AI-enabled wearables and nearables 
      and their use to improve IBD management is also included. EXPERT OPINION: 
      Although challenges regarding data quality, privacy, and security; ethical 
      concerns; technical limitations; and regulatory barriers remain to be fully 
      addressed, a growing body of evidence suggests a tremendous potential for 
      integration of AI into daily clinical practice to enable precision medicine and 
      shared decision-making.

OAB - Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) show promise for improving treatment 
      response prediction, decision-making, and precision medicine in inflammatory 
      bowel disease (IBD).In particular, AI could improve precision medicine for IBD by 
      enabling identification of disease subtypes, prediction of disease progression 
      and treatment response, selection of personalized treatments, and remote 
      monitoring.Predictive models can benefit clinicians and patients alike by 
      optimizing shared decision-making processes; patients can also use AI to cope 
      with daily and long-term challenges of the disease.Beyond patients and 
      practitioners, predictive models may positively impact healthcare structures and 
      payers by enabling effective healthcare-resource utilization.To increase the 
      accuracy and efficiency of AI models, biomarkers, patient-reported outcomes, and 
      disease scores should be combined within predictive models, and the outputs 
      should be compared with clinical trial data and real-world data for validation.

TI  - Internet of Things Technologies and Machine Learning Methods for Parkinson's 
      Disease Diagnosis, Monitoring and Management: A Systematic Review.

LID - 1799
AB  - Parkinson's disease is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that affects a large 
      portion of the population, especially the elderly. It manifests with motor, 
      cognitive and other types of symptoms, decreasing significantly the patients' 
      quality of life. The recent advances in the Internet of Things and Artificial 
      Intelligence fields, including the subdomains of machine learning and deep 
      learning, can support Parkinson's disease patients, their caregivers and 
      clinicians at every stage of the disease, maximizing the treatment effectiveness 
      and minimizing the respective healthcare costs at the same time. In this review, 
      the considered studies propose machine learning models, trained on data acquired 
      via smart devices, wearable or non-wearable sensors and other Internet of Things 
      technologies, to provide predictions or estimations regarding Parkinson's disease 
      aspects. Seven hundred and seventy studies have been retrieved from three 
      dominant academic literature databases. Finally, one hundred and twelve of them 
      have been selected in a systematic way and have been considered in the 
      state-of-the-art systematic review presented in this paper. These studies propose 
      various methods, applied on various sensory data to address different Parkinson's 
      disease-related problems. The most widely deployed sensors, the most commonly 
      addressed problems and the best performing algorithms are highlighted. Finally, 
      some challenges are summarized along with some future considerations and 
      opportunities that arise.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Physical disabilities become more common with advancing age. 
      Rehabilitation restores function, maintaining independence for longer. However, 
      the poor availability and accessibility of rehabilitation limits its clinical 
      impact. Artificial Intelligence (AI) guided interventions have improved many 
      domains of healthcare, but whether rehabilitation can benefit from AI remains 
      unclear. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of AI-supported physical 
      rehabilitation technology tested in the clinical setting to understand: 1) 
      availability of AI-supported physical rehabilitation technology; 2) its clinical 
      effect; 3) and the barriers and facilitators to implementation. We searched in 
      MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Science Citation Index (Web of Science), CIRRIE (now 
      NARIC), and OpenGrey. RESULTS: We identified 9054 articles and included 28 
      projects. AI solutions spanned five categories: App-based systems, robotic 
      devices that replace function, robotic devices that restore function, gaming 
      systems and wearables. We identified five randomised controlled trials (RCTs), 
      which evaluated outcomes relating to physical function, activity, pain, and 
      health-related quality of life. The clinical effects were inconsistent. 
      Implementation barriers included technology literacy, reliability, and user 
      fatigue. Enablers included greater access to rehabilitation programmes, remote 
      monitoring of progress, reduction in manpower requirements and lower cost. 
      CONCLUSION: Application of AI in physical rehabilitation is a growing field, but 
      clinical effects have yet to be studied rigorously. Developers must strive to 
      conduct robust clinical evaluations in the real-world setting and appraise post 
      implementation experiences.

TI  - Data-driven digital health technologies in the remote clinical care of diabetic 
      foot ulcers: a scoping review.
PG  - 1212182
LID - 10.3389/fcdhc.2023.1212182 [doi]
LID - 1212182
AB  - BACKGROUND: The availability and effectiveness of Digital Health Technologies 
      (DHTs) to support clinicians, empower patients, and generate economic savings for 
      national healthcare systems are growing rapidly. Of particular promise is the 
      capacity of DHTs to autonomously facilitate remote monitoring and treatment. 
      Diabetic Foot Ulcers (DFUs) are characterised by high rates of infection, 
      amputation, mortality, and healthcare costs. With clinical outcomes contingent on 
      activities that can be readily monitored, DFUs present a promising focus for the 
      application of remote DHTs. OBJECTIVE: This scoping review has been conducted as 
      a first step toward ascertaining fthe data-related challenges and opportunities 
      for the development of more comprehensive, integrated, and individualised 
      sense/act DHTs. We review the latest developments in the application of DHTs to 
      the remote care of DFUs. We cover the types of DHTs in development and their 
      features, technological readiness, and scope of clinical testing. ELIGIBILITY 
      CRITERIA: Only peer-reviewed original experimental and observational studies, 
      case series and qualitative studies were included in literature searches. All 
      reviews and manuscripts presenting pre-trial prototype technologies were 
      excluded. METHODS: An initial search of three databases (Web of Science, MEDLINE, 
      and Scopus) generated 1,925 English-language papers for screening. 388 papers 
      were assessed as eligible for full-text screening by the review team. 81 
      manuscripts were found to meet the eligibility criteria. RESULTS: Only 19% of 
      studies incorporated multiple DHTs. We categorised 56% of studies as 
      'Treatment-Manual', i.e. studies involving technologies aimed at treatment 
      requiring manual data generation, and 26% as 'Prevention-Autonomous', i.e. 
      studies of technologies generating data autonomously through wearable sensors 
      aimed at ulcer prevention through patient behavioural change. Only 10% of studies 
      involved more ambitious 'Treatment-Autonomous' interventions. We found that 
      studies generally reported high levels of patient adherence and satisfaction. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our findings point to a major potential role for DHTs in remote 
      personalised medical management of DFUs. However, larger studies are required to 
      assess their impact. Here, we see opportunities for developing much larger, more 
      comprehensive, and integrated monitoring and decision support systems with the 
      potential to address the disease in a more complete context by capturing and 
      integrating data from multiple sources from subjective and objective 
      measurements.

TI  - Cloud Native Remote Monitoring Data Ecosystem for Aging Population based on 
      Commercial AAL Sensors.
PG  - 1-5
LID - 10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10340481 [doi]
AB  - In the recent years, Active Assisted Living (AAL) technologies used for 
      autonomous tracking and activity recognition have started to play major roles in 
      geriatric care. From fall detection to remotely monitoring behavioral patterns, 
      vital functions and collection of air quality data, AAL has become pervasive in 
      the modern era of independent living for the elderly section of the population. 
      However, even with the current rate of progress, data access and data reliability 
      has become a major hurdle especially when such data is intended to be used in new 
      age modelling approaches such as those using machine learning. This paper 
      presents a comprehensive data ecosystem comprising remote monitoring AAL sensors 
      along with extensive focus on cloud native system architecture, secured and 
      confidential access to data with easy data sharing. Results from a validation 
      study illustrate the feasibility of using this system for remote healthcare 
      surveillance. The proposed system shows great promise in multiple fields from 
      various AAL studies to development of data driven policies by local governments 
      in promoting healthy lifestyles for the elderly alongside a common data 
      repository that can be beneficial to other research communities 
      worldwide.Clinical Relevance- This study creates a cloud-based smart home data 
      ecosystem, which can achieve the remote healthcare monitoring for aging 
      population, enabling them to live more independently and decreasing hospital 
      admission rates.

TI  - An Intelligent Wearable Filtration System for Health Management.
PG  - 7035-7046
LID - 10.1021/acsnano.3c02099 [doi]
AB  - To develop intelligent wearable protection systems is of great significance to 
      human health engineering. An ideal intelligent air filtration system should 
      possess reliable filtration efficiency, low pressure drop, healthcare monitoring 
      function, and man-machine interactive capability. However, no existing 
      intelligent protection system covers all these essential aspects. Herein, we 
      developed an intelligent wearable filtration system (IWFS) via advanced 
      nanotechnology and machine learning. Based on the triboelectric mechanism, the 
      fabricated IWFS exhibits a long-lasting high particle filtration efficiency and 
      bacteria protection efficiency of 99% and 100%, respectively, with a low-pressure 
      drop of 5.8 mmH(2)O. Correspondingly, the charge accumulation of the optimized 
      IWFS (87 nC) increased to 3.5 times that of the pristine nanomesh, providing a 
      significant enhancement of the particle filtration efficiency. Theoretical 
      principles, including the enhancement of the β-phase and the lower surface 
      potential of the modified nanomesh, were quantitatively investigated by molecular 
      dynamics simulation, band theory, and Kelvin probe force microscopy. Furthermore, 
      we endowed the IWFS with a healthcare monitoring function and man-machine 
      interactive capability through machine learning and wireless transmission 
      technology. Crucial physiological signals of people, including breath, cough, and 
      speaking signals, were detected and classified, with a high recognition rate of 
      92%; the fabricated IWFS can collect healthcare data and transmit voice commands 
      in real time without hindrance by portable electronic devices. The achieved IWFS 
      not only has practical significance for human health management but also has 
      great theoretical value for advanced wearable systems.

AB  - There is no escaping Internet's favorite buzzword for 2022: The Metaverse. 
      Everyone is talking about it, but only a few know what it is or how it works. One 
      can look at the Metaverse as a 3D model of the Internet where it is possible to 
      spend your reality parallel to the virtual world. In broad terms, Metaverse can 
      be explained as a virtual space, graphically rich, leaning towards verisimilitude 
      where people can do all sorts of things they do in real-life such as shop, play, 
      socialize, and party. The pandemic has accelerated innovations in the digital 
      age. Looking beyond revolutions in telehealth, payments, remote monitoring, and 
      secure data-sharing are other essential innovations in the fields of artificial 
      intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and blockchain 
      technology. The Metaverse is still in its nascent stage and evolving 
      continuously, having a huge potential in health care to combine the technologies 
      of AI, AR/VR, web 3.0, Internet of medical devices, and quantum computing, along 
      with robotics to give a new direction to healthcare systems. From improving 
      surgical precision to therapeutic usage and more, the Metaverse can bring 
      significant changes to the industry.

TI  - Cadence Detection in Road Cycling Using Saddle Tube Motion and Machine Learning.
LID - 10.3390/s22166140 [doi]
LID - 6140
AB  - Most commercial cadence-measurement systems in road cycling are strictly limited 
      in their function to the measurement of cadence. Other relevant signals, such as 
      roll angle, inclination or a round kick evaluation, cannot be measured with them. 
      This work proposes an alternative cadence-measurement system with less of the 
      mentioned restrictions, without the need for distinct cadence-measurement 
      apparatus attached to the pedal and shaft of the road bicycle. The proposed 
      design applies an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to the seating pole of the 
      bike. In an experiment, the motion data were gathered. A total of four different 
      road cyclists participated in this study to collect different datasets for neural 
      network training and evaluation. In total, over 10 h of road cycling data were 
      recorded and used to train the neural network. The network's aim was to detect 
      each revolution of the crank within the data. The evaluation of the data has 
      shown that using pure accelerometer data from all three axes led to the best 
      result in combination with the proposed network architecture. A working proof of 
      concept was achieved with an accuracy of approximately 95% on test data. As the 
      proof of concept can also be seen as a new method for measuring cadence, the 
      method was compared with the ground truth. Comparing the ground truth and the 
      predicted cadence, it can be stated that for the relevant range of 50 rpm and 
      above, the prediction over-predicts the cadence with approximately 0.9 rpm with a 
      standard deviation of 2.05 rpm. The results indicate that the proposed design is 
      fully functioning and can be seen as an alternative method to detect the cadence 
      of a road cyclist.

TI  - Remote Physical Frailty Monitoring-The Application of Deep Learning-Based Image 
      Processing in Tele-Health.
PG  - 219391-219399
LID - 10.1109/access.2020.3042451 [doi]
AB  - Remote screening physical frailty (PF) may assist in triaging patients with 
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who are in clinical priorities to 
      visit a clinical center for preventive care. Conventional PF assessment tools 
      have however limited feasibility for remote patient monitoring applications. To 
      improve the safety of PF assessment, we previously developed and validated a 
      quick and safe PF screening tool called Frailty Meter (FM). FM works by 
      quantifying weakness, slowness, rigidity, and exhaustion during a 20-second 
      repetitive elbow flexion/extension task using a wrist-worn sensor and generates a 
      frailty index (FI) ranging from zero to one; higher values indicate progressively 
      greater severity of frailty. However, the use of wrist-sensor limits its 
      applications in telemedicine and remote patient monitoring. In this study, we 
      developed a sensor-less FM based on deep learning-based image processing, which 
      can be easily integrated into mobile health and enables remote assessment of 
      physical frailty. The sensor-less FM extracts kinematic features of the forearm 
      motion from the video of 20-second elbow flexion and extension recorded by a 
      tablet camera, and then calculates frailty phenotypes and FI. To test the 
      validity of sensor-less FM, 11 COPD patients admitted to a Telehealth pulmonary 
      rehabilitation clinic and 10 healthy young volunteers (controls) were recruited. 
      All participants completed the test indicating high feasibility. Strong 
      correlations (0.72 < r < 0.99) were observed between the sensor-based FM and 
      sensor-less FM to extract all frailty phenotypes and FI. After adjusting with age 
      and body mass index(BMI), sensor-less FM enables distinguishing COPD group from 
      controls (p<0.050) with the largest effect sizes observed for weakness (Cohen's 
      effect size d=2.24), frailty index (d=1.70), and slowness (d=1.70). These pilot 
      findings suggest feasibility and proof of concept validity of this sensor-less FM 
      toward remote assessment of PF in COPD patients.

TI  - Wearable Monitoring and Interpretable Machine Learning Can Objectively Track 
      Progression in Patients during Cardiac Rehabilitation.
LID - 10.3390/s20123601 [doi]
LID - 3601
AB  - Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are often characterized by their multifactorial 
      complexity. This makes remote monitoring and ambulatory cardiac rehabilitation 
      (CR) therapy challenging. Current wearable multimodal devices enable remote 
      monitoring. Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) can help in 
      tackling multifaceted datasets. However, for clinical acceptance, easy 
      interpretability of the AI models is crucial. The goal of the present study was 
      to investigate whether a multi-parameter sensor could be used during a 
      standardized activity test to interpret functional capacity in the longitudinal 
      follow-up of CR patients. A total of 129 patients were followed for 3 months 
      during CR using 6-min walking tests (6MWT) equipped with a wearable ECG and 
      accelerometer device. Functional capacity was assessed based on 6MWT distance 
      (6MWD). Linear and nonlinear interpretable models were explored to predict 6MWD. 
      The t-distributed stochastic neighboring embedding (t-SNE) technique was 
      exploited to embed and visualize high dimensional data. The performance of 
      support vector machine (SVM) models, combining different features and using 
      different kernel types, to predict functional capacity was evaluated. The SVM 
      model, using chronotropic response and effort as input features, showed a mean 
      absolute error of 42.8 m (±36.8 m). The 3D-maps derived using the t-SNE technique 
      visualized the relationship between sensor-derived biomarkers and functional 
      capacity, which enables tracking of the evolution of patients throughout the CR 
      program. The current study showed that wearable monitoring combined with 
      interpretable ML can objectively track clinical progression in a CR population. 
      These results pave the road towards ambulatory CR.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality 
      worldwide. The advent of smart technologies has significantly impacted the 
      management of CVD, offering innovative tools and solutions to improve patient 
      outcomes. Smart technologies have revolutionized and transformed the management 
      of CVD, providing innovative tools to improve patient care, enhance diagnostics, 
      and enable more personalized treatment approaches. These smart tools encompass a 
      wide range of technologies, including wearable devices, mobile applications,3D 
      printing technologies, artificial intelligence (AI), remote monitoring systems, 
      and electronic health records (EHR). They offer numerous advantages, such as 
      real-time monitoring, early detection of abnormalities, remote patient 
      management, and data-driven decision-making. However, they also come with certain 
      limitations and challenges, including data privacy concerns, technical issues, 
      and the need for regulatory frameworks. In this review, despite these challenges, 
      the future of smart technologies in CVD management looks promising, with 
      advancements in AI algorithms, telemedicine platforms, and bio fabrication 
      techniques opening new possibilities for personalized and efficient care. In this 
      article, we also explore the role of smart technologies in CVD management, their 
      advantages and disadvantages, limitations, current applications, and their smart 
      future.

TI  - Non-Invasive Blood Pressure Sensing via Machine Learning.
LID - 10.3390/s23198342 [doi]
LID - 8342
AB  - In this paper, a machine learning (ML) approach to estimate blood pressure (BP) 
      using photoplethysmography (PPG) is presented. The final aim of this paper was to 
      develop ML methods for estimating blood pressure (BP) in a non-invasive way that 
      is suitable in a telemedicine health-care monitoring context. The training of 
      regression models useful for estimating systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 
      diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was conducted using new extracted features from 
      PPG signals processed using the Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform 
      (MODWT). As a matter of fact, the interest was on the use of the most significant 
      features obtained by the Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (MRMR) selection 
      algorithm to train eXtreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost) and Neural Network (NN) 
      models. This aim was satisfactorily achieved by also comparing it with works in 
      the literature; in fact, it was found that XGBoost models are more accurate than 
      NN models in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements, obtaining a 
      Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for SBP and DBP, respectively, of 5.67 mmHg and 
      3.95 mmHg. For SBP measurement, this result is an improvement compared to that 
      reported in the literature. Furthermore, the trained XGBoost regression model 
      fulfills the requirements of the Association for the Advancement of Medical 
      Instrumentation (AAMI) as well as grade A of the British Hypertension Society 
      (BHS) standard.

TI  - The Recent Advances of Mobile Healthcare in Cardiology Practice.
PG  - 236-250
LID - 10.5455/aim.2022.30.236-250 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Digitalization of healthcare led to the optimization of monitoring, 
      diagnostics, and treatment of the range of disorders. Taking into account recent 
      situation with COVID-19 pandemics, digital technologies allowed to improve 
      management of viral infections via remote monitoring and diagnostics of infected 
      patients. Up to date, various mobile health applications (apps) have been 
      proposed, including apps for the patients diagnosed with cardiovascular 
      pathologies. OBJECTIVE: The presented review aimed at the analyses of a range of 
      mHealth solutions used to improve primary cardiac care. In addition, we studied 
      the factors driving and hindering the wide introduction of mHealth services in 
      the clinics. METHODS: The work was based on the guidelines of the preferred 
      reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. The 
      publication search was carried out using PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane 
      Library, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases. Studies published during the 
      period from 2014 until January 2022 were selected for the analysis. The 
      evaluation of risk of bias for the included studies was conducted using the 
      Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias tool. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: An overall 5513 
      studies were assessed for eligibility after which 39 studies were included.. The 
      main trend in the mobile health for cardiological applications is the use of 
      different types of wearable devices and Artificial Intelligence-platforms. In 
      fact, mobile technology allows remotely to monitor, interpret, and analyze 
      biomedical data collected from the patient. CONCLUSION: The results of this 
      literature search demonstrated that patients diagnosed with cardiovascular 
      disorders can potentially benefit from the application of mHealth in cardiology. 
      However, despite the proven advantages of mHealth for cardiology, there are many 
      challenges and concerns regarding effectiveness, safety, reliability and the lack 
      of official regulation and guidelines from official organizations. Such issues 
      require solutions and further work towards a wide implementation of mHealth 
      technologies in cardiac practice.

TI  - A Deep Machine Learning Method for Concurrent and Interleaved Human Activity 
      Recognition.
LID - 10.3390/s20205770 [doi]
LID - 5770
AB  - Human activity recognition has become an important research topic within the 
      field of pervasive computing, ambient assistive living (AAL), robotics, 
      health-care monitoring, and many more. Techniques for recognizing simple and 
      single activities are typical for now, but recognizing complex activities such as 
      concurrent and interleaving activity is still a major challenging issue. In this 
      paper, we propose a two-phase hybrid deep machine learning approach using 
      bi-directional Long-Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) and Skip-Chain Conditional random 
      field (SCCRF) to recognize the complex activity. BiLSTM is a sequential 
      generative deep learning inherited from Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). SCCRFs is 
      a distinctive feature of conditional random field (CRF) that can represent long 
      term dependencies. In the first phase of the proposed approach, we recognized the 
      concurrent activities using the BiLSTM technique, and in the second phase, SCCRF 
      identifies the interleaved activity. Accuracy of the proposed framework against 
      the counterpart state-of-art methods using the publicly available datasets in a 
      smart home environment is analyzed. Our experiment's result surpasses the 
      previously proposed approaches with an average accuracy of more than 93%.

TI  - Water-Tolerant MXene Epidermal Sensors with High Sensitivity and Reliability for 
      Healthcare Monitoring.
PG  - 21253-21262
LID - 10.1021/acsami.2c03731 [doi]
AB  - Flexible and wearable pressure sensors have gained great popularity in consumer 
      electronics due to their potential applications in human healthcare, E-skin, and 
      artificial intelligence interactions. MXene is regarded as one of the most ideal 
      candidate sensing materials due to its high electrical conductivity and 
      controllable interlayer space. However, the easy-to-oxidize characteristic of 
      MXene materials greatly restricts the sensitivity and reliability of sensor 
      devices, especially in wet climates. Herein, a highly sensitive and waterproof 
      flexible pressure sensor using a free-standing hydrophobic bacterial 
      cellulose/Ti(3)C(2)T(x) MXene (HBT) hybrid film as a sensing layer is fabricated 
      by facile and effective nanocellulose intercalation and fluorine modification 
      strategies. The obtained pressure sensor delivers high sensitivity (65.5 
      kPa(-1)), fast response (50 ms), wide linear sensing range (0.002-30 kPa) with a 
      low detection limit of 0.57 Pa, and excellent repeatability over 50,000 cycles. 
      Meanwhile, owing to the highly hydrophobic surface of the HTB film, the 
      outstanding sensing features could be well retained, although immersed in water 
      several times. Benefiting from the excellent sensing properties and water 
      resistance, the HBT sensor serves as a wearable force sensor to monitor the 
      full-range human physiological motions regardless of whether the conditions are 
      normal or wet. This work provides a new pathway to design the MXene pressure 
      sensor with high reliability and demonstrates the promising usage of HBT sensors 
      in portable biomedical electronics.

TI  - Smartphone and Wearable Sensors for the Estimation of Facioscapulohumeral 
      Muscular Dystrophy Disease Severity: Cross-sectional Study.
PG  - e41178
LID - 10.2196/41178 [doi]
LID - e41178
AB  - BACKGROUND: Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a progressive 
      neuromuscular disease. Its slow and variable progression makes the development of 
      new treatments highly dependent on validated biomarkers that can quantify disease 
      progression and response to drug interventions. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to build a 
      tool that estimates FSHD clinical severity based on behavioral features captured 
      using smartphone and remote sensor data. The adoption of remote monitoring tools, 
      such as smartphones and wearables, would provide a novel opportunity for 
      continuous, passive, and objective monitoring of FSHD symptom severity outside 
      the clinic. METHODS: In total, 38 genetically confirmed patients with FSHD were 
      enrolled. The FSHD Clinical Score and the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test were used to 
      assess FSHD symptom severity at days 0 and 42. Remote sensor data were collected 
      using an Android smartphone, Withings Steel HR+, Body+, and BPM Connect+ for 6 
      continuous weeks. We created 2 single-task regression models that estimated the 
      FSHD Clinical Score and TUG separately. Further, we built 1 multitask regression 
      model that estimated the 2 clinical assessments simultaneously. Further, we 
      assessed how an increasingly incremental time window affected the model 
      performance. To do so, we trained the models on an incrementally increasing time 
      window (from day 1 until day 14) and evaluated the predictions of the clinical 
      severity on the remaining 4 weeks of data. RESULTS: The single-task regression 
      models achieved an R(2) of 0.57 and 0.59 and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 
      2.09 and 1.66 when estimating FSHD Clinical Score and TUG, respectively. Time 
      spent at a health-related location (such as a gym or hospital) and call duration 
      were features that were predictive of both clinical assessments. The multitask 
      model achieved an R(2) of 0.66 and 0.81 and an RMSE of 1.97 and 1.61 for the FSHD 
      Clinical Score and TUG, respectively, and therefore outperformed the single-task 
      models in estimating clinical severity. The 3 most important features selected by 
      the multitask model were light sleep duration, total steps per day, and mean 
      steps per minute. Using an increasing time window (starting from day 1 to day 14) 
      for the FSHD Clinical Score, TUG, and multitask estimation yielded an average 
      R(2) of 0.65, 0.79, and 0.76 and an average RMSE of 3.37, 2.05, and 4.37, 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that smartphone and remote sensor data 
      could be used to estimate FSHD clinical severity and therefore complement the 
      assessment of FSHD outside the clinic. In addition, our results illustrated that 
      training the models on the first week of data allows for consistent and stable 
      prediction of FSHD symptom severity. Longitudinal follow-up studies should be 
      conducted to further validate the reliability and validity of the multitask model 
      as a tool to monitor disease progression over a longer period. TRIAL

AB  - Wearable sensor-based devices are increasingly applied in free-living and 
      clinical settings to collect fine-grained, objective data about activity and 
      sleep behavior. The manufacturers of these devices provide proprietary software 
      that labels the sensor data at specified time intervals with activity and sleep 
      information. If the device wearer has a health condition affecting their 
      movement, such as a stroke, these labels and their values can vary greatly from 
      manufacturer to manufacturer. Consequently, generating outcome predictions based 
      on data collected from patients attending inpatient rehabilitation wearing 
      different sensor devices can be challenging, which hampers usefulness of these 
      data for patient care decisions. In this article, we present a data-driven 
      approach to combining datasets collected from different device manufacturers. 
      With the ability to combine datasets, we merge data from three different device 
      manufacturers to form a larger dataset of time series data collected from 44 
      patients receiving inpatient therapy services. To gain insights into the recovery 
      process, we use this dataset to build models that predict a patient's next day 
      physical activity duration and next night sleep duration. Using our data-driven 
      approach and the combined dataset, we obtained a normalized root mean square 
      error prediction of 9.11% for daytime physical activity and 11.18% for nighttime 
      sleep duration. Our sleep result is comparable to the accuracy we achieved using 
      the manufacturer's sleep labels (12.26%). Our device-independent predictions are 
      suitable for both point-of-care and remote monitoring applications to provide 
      information to clinicians for customizing therapy services and potentially 
      decreasing recovery time.

TI  - Towards a Low-Cost Solution for Gait Analysis Using Millimeter Wave Sensor and 
      Machine Learning.
LID - 10.3390/s22155470 [doi]
LID - 5470
AB  - Human Activity Recognition (HAR) that includes gait analysis may be useful for 
      various rehabilitation and telemonitoring applications. Current gait analysis 
      methods, such as wearables or cameras, have privacy and operational constraints, 
      especially when used with older adults. Millimeter-Wave (MMW) radar is a 
      promising solution for gait applications because of its low-cost, better privacy, 
      and resilience to ambient light and climate conditions. This paper presents a 
      novel human gait analysis method that combines the micro-Doppler spectrogram and 
      skeletal pose estimation using MMW radar for HAR. In our approach, we used the 
      Texas Instruments IWR6843ISK-ODS MMW radar to obtain the micro-Doppler 
      spectrogram and point clouds for 19 human joints. We developed a multilayer 
      Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize and classify five different gait 
      patterns with an accuracy of 95.7 to 98.8% using MMW radar data. During training 
      of the CNN algorithm, we used the extracted 3D coordinates of 25 joints using the 
      Kinect V2 sensor and compared them with the point clouds data to improve the 
      estimation. Finally, we performed a real-time simulation to observe the point 
      cloud behavior for different activities and validated our system against the 
      ground truth values. The proposed method demonstrates the ability to distinguish 
      between different human activities to obtain clinically relevant gait 
      information.

AB  - Post-surgical treatments of the human throat often require continuous monitoring 
      of diverse vital and muscle activities. However, wireless, continuous monitoring 
      and analysis of these activities directly from the throat skin have not been 
      developed. Here, we report the design and validation of a fully integrated 
      standalone stretchable device platform that provides wireless measurements and 
      machine learning-based analysis of diverse vibrations and muscle electrical 
      activities from the throat. We demonstrate that the modified composite hydrogel 
      with low contact impedance and reduced adhesion provides high-quality long-term 
      monitoring of local muscle electrical signals. We show that the integrated 
      triaxial broad-band accelerometer also measures large body movements and subtle 
      physiological activities/vibrations. We find that the combined data processed by 
      a 2D-like sequential feature extractor with fully connected neurons facilitates 
      the classification of various motion/speech features at a high accuracy of over 
      90%, which adapts to the data with noise from motion artifacts or the data from 
      new human subjects. The resulting standalone stretchable device with wireless 
      monitoring and machine learning-based processing capabilities paves the way to 
      design and apply wearable skin-interfaced systems for the remote monitoring and 
      treatment evaluation of various diseases.

AB  - Microalgal biotechnology holds the potential for renewable biofuels, bioproducts, 
      and carbon capture applications due to unparalleled photosynthetic efficiency and 
      diversity. Outdoor open raceway pond (ORP) cultivation enables utilization of 
      sunlight and atmospheric carbon dioxide to drive microalgal biomass synthesis for 
      production of bioproducts including biofuels; however, environmental conditions 
      are highly dynamic and fluctuate both diurnally and seasonally, making ORP 
      productivity prediction challenging without time-intensive physical measurements 
      and location-specific calibrations. Here, for the first time, we present an 
      image-based deep learning method for the prediction of ORP productivity. Our 
      method is based on parameter profile plot images of sensor parameters, including 
      pH, dissolved oxygen, temperature, photosynthetically active radiation, and total 
      dissolved solids. These parameters can be remotely monitored without physical 
      interaction with ORPs. We apply the model to data we generated during the Unified 
      Field Studies of the Algae Testbed Public-Private-Partnership (ATP(3) UFS), the 
      largest publicly available ORP data set to date, which includes millions of 
      sensor records and 598 productivities from 32 ORPs operated in 5 states in the 
      United States. We demonstrate that this approach significantly outperforms an 
      average value based traditional machine learning method (R(2) = 0.77 ≫ R(2) = 
      0.39) without considering bioprocess parameters (e.g., biomass density, hydraulic 
      retention time, and nutrient concentrations). We then evaluate the sensitivity of 
      image and monitoring data resolutions and input parameter variations. Our results 
      demonstrate ORP productivity can be effectively predicted from remote monitoring 
      data, providing an inexpensive tool for microalgal production and operational 
      forecasting.

TI  - Digital Endpoints: Definition, Benefits, and Current Barriers in Accelerating 
      Development and Adoption.
PG  - 216-223
LID - 10.1159/000517885 [doi]
AB  - The assessment of health and disease requires a set of criteria to define health 
      status and progression. These health measures are referred to as "endpoints." A 
      "digital endpoint" is defined by its use of sensor-generated data often collected 
      outside of a clinical setting such as in a patient's free-living environment. 
      Applicable sensors exist in an array of devices and can be applied in a diverse 
      set of contexts. For example, a smartphone's microphone might be used to diagnose 
      or predict mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease or a wrist-worn 
      activity monitor (such as those found in smartwatches) may be used to measure a 
      drug's effect on the nocturnal activity of patients with sickle cell disease. 
      Digital endpoints are generating considerable excitement because they permit a 
      more authentic assessment of the patient's experience, reveal formerly untold 
      realities of disease burden, and can cut drug discovery costs in half. However, 
      before these benefits can be realized, effort must be applied not only to the 
      technical creation of digital endpoints but also to the environment that allows 
      for their development and application. The future of digital endpoints rests on 
      meaningful interdisciplinary collaboration, sufficient evidence that digital 
      endpoints can realize their promise, and the development of an ecosystem in which 
      the vast quantities of data that digital endpoints generate can be analyzed. The 
      fundamental nature of health care is changing. With coronavirus disease 2019 
      serving as a catalyst, there has been a rapid expansion of home care models, 
      telehealth, and remote patient monitoring. The increasing adoption of these 
      health-care innovations will expedite the requirement for a digital 
      characterization of clinical status as current assessment tools often rely upon 
      direct interaction with patients and thus are not fit for purpose to be 
      administered remotely. With the ubiquity of relatively inexpensive sensors, 
      digital endpoints are positioned to drive this consequential change. It is 
      therefore not surprising that regulators, physicians, researchers, and 
      consultants have each offered their assessment of these novel tools. However, as 
      we further describe later, the broad adoption of digital endpoints will require a 
      cooperative effort. In this article, we present an analysis of the current state 
      of digital endpoints. We also attempt to unify the perspectives of the parties 
      involved in the development and deployment of these tools. We conclude with an 
      interdependent list of challenges that must be collaboratively addressed before 
      these endpoints are widely adopted.

TI  - Wearable Seismocardiography-Based Assessment of Stroke Volume in Congenital Heart 
      Disease.

LID - e026067
AB  - Background Patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) are at risk for the 
      development of low cardiac output and other physiologic derangements, which could 
      be detected early through continuous stroke volume (SV) measurement. 
      Unfortunately, existing SV measurement methods are limited in the clinic because 
      of their invasiveness (eg, thermodilution), location (eg, cardiac magnetic 
      resonance imaging), or unreliability (eg, bioimpedance). Multimodal wearable 
      sensing, leveraging the seismocardiogram, a sternal vibration signal associated 
      with cardiomechanical activity, offers a means to monitoring SV conveniently, 
      affordably, and continuously. However, it has not been evaluated in a population 
      with significant anatomical and physiological differences (ie, children with CHD) 
      or compared against a true gold standard (ie, cardiac magnetic resonance). Here, 
      we present the feasibility of wearable estimation of SV in a diverse CHD 
      population (N=45 patients). Methods and Results We used our chest-worn wearable 
      biosensor to measure baseline ECG and seismocardiogram signals from patients with 
      CHD before and after their routine cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging, and 
      derived features from the measured signals, predominantly systolic time 
      intervals, to estimate SV using ridge regression. Wearable signal features 
      achieved acceptable SV estimation (28% error with respect to cardiovascular 
      magnetic resonance imaging) in a held-out test set, per cardiac output 
      measurement guidelines, with a root-mean-square error of 11.48 mL and R(2) of 
      0.76. Additionally, we observed that using a combination of electrical and 
      cardiomechanical features surpassed the performance of either modality alone. 
      Conclusions A convenient wearable biosensor that estimates SV enables remote 
      monitoring of cardiac function and may potentially help identify decompensation 
      in patients with CHD.

AB  - Wearable devices and mobile sensors enable the real-time collection of an 
      abundant source of physiological and behavioural data unobtrusively. Unlike 
      traditional in-person evaluation or ecological momentary assessment (EMA) 
      questionnaire-based approaches, these data sources open many possibilities in 
      remote patient monitoring. However, defining robust models is challenging due to 
      the data's noisy and frequently missing observations. This work proposes an 
      attention-based Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network-based pipeline for 
      predicting mobility impairment based on WHODAS 2.0 evaluation from such digital 
      biomarkers. Furthermore, we addressed the missing observation problem by 
      utilising hidden Markov models and the possibility of including information from 
      unlabelled samples via transfer learning. We validated our approach using two 
      wearable/mobile sensor data sets collected in the wild and socio-demographic 
      information about the patients. Our results showed that in the WHODAS 2.0 
      mobility impairment prediction task, the proposed pipeline outperformed a prior 
      baseline while additionally providing interpretability with attention heatmaps. 
      Moreover, using a much smaller cohort via task transfer learning, the same model 
      could learn to predict generalised anxiety severity accurately based on GAD-7 
      scores.

TI  - Bending Sensor Based on Controlled Microcracking Regions for Application toward 
      Wearable Electronics and Robotics.
PG  - 31312-31320
LID - 10.1021/acsami.2c07795 [doi]
AB  - A soft bending sensor based on the inverse pyramid structure is demonstrated, 
      revealing that it can effectively suppress microcrack formation in designated 
      regions, thus allowing the cracks to open gradually with bending in a controlled 
      manner. Such a feature enabled the bending sensor to simultaneously have a wide 
      dynamic range of bending strain (0.025-5.4%), high gauge factor (∼74), and high 
      linearity (R(2) ∼ 0.99). Furthermore, the bending sensor can capture repeated 
      instantaneous changes in strain and various types of vibrations, owing to its 
      fast response time. Moreover, the bending direction can be differentiated with a 
      single layer of the sensor, and using an array of sensors integrated on a glove, 
      object recognition was demonstrated via machine learning. Finally, a 
      self-monitoring proprioceptive ionic electroactive polymer (IEAP) actuator 
      capable of operating in liquid was demonstrated. Such features of our bending 
      sensor will enable a simple and effective way of detecting sophisticated motion, 
      thus potentially advancing wearable healthcare monitoring electronics and 
      enabling proprioceptive soft robotics.

TI  - Personalized vascular healthcare: insights from a large international survey.
PG  - H8-H17

AB  - Fragmentation of healthcare systems through limited cross-speciality 
      communication and intermittent, intervention-based care, without insight into 
      follow-up and compliance, results in poor patient experiences and potentially 
      contributes to suboptimal outcomes. Data-driven tools and novel technologies have 
      the capability to address these shortcomings, but insights from all stakeholders 
      in the care continuum remain lacking. A structured online questionnaire was given 
      to respondents (n = 1432) in nine global geographies to investigate attitudes to 
      the use of data and novel technologies in the management of vascular disease. 
      Patients with coronary or peripheral artery disease (n = 961), physicians 
      responsible for their care (n = 345), and administrators/healthcare leaders with 
      responsibility for commissioning/procuring cardiovascular services (n = 126) were 
      included. Narrative themes arising from the survey included patients' desire for 
      more personalized healthcare, shared decision-making, and improved communication. 
      Patients, administrators, and physicians perceived and experienced deficiencies 
      in continuity of care, and all acknowledged the potential for data-driven 
      techniques and novel technologies to address some of these shortcomings. Further, 
      physicians and administrators saw the 'upstream' segment of the care 
      journey-before diagnosis, at point of diagnosis, and when determining 
      treatment-as key to enabling tangible improvements in patient experience and 
      outcomes. Finally, despite acceptance that data sharing is critical to the 
      success of such interventions, there remains persistent issues related to trust 
      and transparency. The current fragmented care continuum could be improved and 
      streamlined through the adoption of advanced data analytics and novel 
      technologies, including diagnostic and monitoring techniques. Such an approach 
      could enable the refocusing of healthcare from intermittent contacts and 
      intervention-only focus to a more holistic patient view.

AB  - A serious effect on people's life, social communication, and surely on medical 
      staff who were forced to monitor their patients' status remotely relying on the 
      available technologies to avoid potential infections and as a result reducing the 
      workload in hospitals. this research tried to investigate the readiness level of 
      healthcare professionals in both public and private Iraqi hospitals to utilize 
      IoT technology in detecting, tracking, and treating 2019-nCoV pandemic, as well 
      as reducing the direct contact between medical staff and patients with other 
      diseases that can be monitored remotely.A cross-sectional descriptive research 
      via online distributed questionnaire, the sample consisted of 113 physicians and 
      99 pharmacists from three public and two private hospitals who randomly selected 
      by simple random sampling. The 212 responses were deeply analyzed descriptively 
      using frequencies, percentages, means, and standard deviation.The results 
      confirmed that the IoT technology can facilitate patient follow-up by enabling 
      rapid communication between medical staff and patient relatives. Additionally, 
      remote monitoring techniques can measure and treat 2019-nCoV, reducing direct 
      contact by decreasing the workload in healthcare industries. This paper adds to 
      the current healthcare technology literature in Iraq and middle east region an 
      evidence of the readiness to implement IoT technology as an essential technique. 
      Practically, it is strongly advised that healthcare policymakers should implement 
      IoT technology nationwide especially when it comes to safe their employees' 
      life.Iraqi medical staff are fully ready to adopt IoT technology as they became 
      more digital minded after the 2019-nCoV crises and surely their knowledge and 
      technical skills will be improved spontaneously based on diffusion of innovation 
      perspective.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Internet of Things (IoT) integrates several technologies where devices 
      learn from the experience of each other thereby reducing human-intervened likely 
      errors. Modern technologies like IoT and machine learning enable the conventional 
      to patient-specific approach transition in healthcare. In conventional approach, 
      the biggest challenge faced by healthcare professionals is to predict a disease 
      by observing the symptoms, monitoring the remote area patient, and also attending 
      to the patient all the time after being hospitalised. IoT provides real-time 
      data, makes decision-making smarter, and provides far superior analytics, and all 
      these to help improve the quality of healthcare. The main objective of the work 
      was to create an IoT-based automated system using machine learning models for 
      symptom-based COVID-19 prognosis. METHODS: Comparative analysis of predictive 
      microbiology of COVID-19 from case symptoms using various machine learning 
      classifiers like logistics regression, k-nearest neighbor, support vector 
      machine, random forest, decision trees, Naïve Bayes, and gradient booster is 
      reported here. For the sake of the validation and verification of the models, 
      performance of each model based on the retrieved cloud-stored data was measured 
      for accuracy. RESULTS: From the accuracy plot, it was concluded that k-NN was 
      more accurate (97.97%) followed by decision tree (97.79), support vector machine 
      (97.42), logistics regression (96.50), random forest (90.66), gradient boosting 
      classifier (87.77), and Naïve Bayes (73.50) in COVID-19 prognosis. CONCLUSION: 
      The paper presents a health monitoring IoT framework having high clinical 
      significance in real-time and remote healthcare monitoring. The findings reported 
      here and the lessons learnt shall enable the healthcare system worldwide to 
      counter not only this ongoing COVID but many other such global pandemics the 
      humanity may suffer from time to come.

AB  - In recent years, the global Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) industry has 
      evolved at a tremendous speed. Security and privacy are key concerns on the IoMT, 
      owing to the huge scale and deployment of IoMT networks. Machine learning (ML) 
      and blockchain (BC) technologies have significantly enhanced the capabilities and 
      facilities of healthcare 5.0, spawning a new area known as "Smart Healthcare." By 
      identifying concerns early, a smart healthcare system can help avoid long-term 
      damage. This will enhance the quality of life for patients while reducing their 
      stress and healthcare costs. The IoMT enables a range of functionalities in the 
      field of information technology, one of which is smart and interactive health 
      care. However, combining medical data into a single storage location to train a 
      powerful machine learning model raises concerns about privacy, ownership, and 
      compliance with greater concentration. Federated learning (FL) overcomes the 
      preceding difficulties by utilizing a centralized aggregate server to disseminate 
      a global learning model. Simultaneously, the local participant keeps control of 
      patient information, assuring data confidentiality and security. This article 
      conducts a comprehensive analysis of the findings on blockchain technology 
      entangled with federated learning in healthcare. 5.0. The purpose of this study 
      is to construct a secure health monitoring system in healthcare 5.0 by utilizing 
      a blockchain technology and Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to detect any 
      malicious activity in a healthcare network and enables physicians to monitor 
      patients through medical sensors and take necessary measures periodically by 
      predicting diseases. The proposed system demonstrates that the approach is 
      optimized effectively for healthcare monitoring. In contrast, the proposed 
      healthcare 5.0 system entangled with FL Approach achieves 93.22% accuracy for 
      disease prediction, and the proposed RTS-DELM-based secure healthcare 5.0 system 
      achieves 96.18% accuracy for the estimation of intrusion detection.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: E-health is a growing research topic, especially with 
      the expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT). Miniaturized wearable sensors are 
      auspicious tools for biomedicine and healthcare systems. In this paper, we 
      present D-SORM, a sensor fusion-based digital solution intended to assist 
      clinicians and improve their diagnosis by providing objective measurements and 
      automatic recognition. The aim is to supply an interface for remote monitoring to 
      the medical staff. METHODS: D-SORM platform estimates the wearable device 
      attitude based on its acquired data, and visualizes it in real-time using a 
      graphical user interface (GUI). It also integrates two modules which serve two 
      different medical applications. The first one is arm tele-rehabilitation, where 
      sessions are done online. The practitioner gives the instructions while wearing 
      the device, and the patient has to reproduce the gestures. A processing unit is 
      dedicated to compute statistical features and calculate the success rate. The 
      second one is human motion tracking for elderly care. A novel machine learning 
      architecture is proposed, based on feature fusion, to predict the activities of 
      daily living. RESULTS: The rehabilitation mechanism was tested under supervised 
      conditions, by performing a set of movements. D-SORM provides extra information 
      and objective measurements, thus facilitates the diagnosis of clinicians. The 
      human activity recognition is also validated using a public dataset. With D-SORM, 
      an efficiency ranging from 97.7% to 99.65% is ensured under unsupervised 
      conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed design constitutes a digital clinical tool 
      for medical teams allowing remote health monitoring. It overcomes geographical 
      barriers while providing faster and highly accurate assessment.

TI  - Predicting post-discharge cancer surgery complications via telemonitoring of 
      patient-reported outcomes and patient-generated health data.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Post-discharge oncologic surgical complications are 
      costly for patients, families, and healthcare systems. The capacity to predict 
      complications and early intervention can improve postoperative outcomes. In this 
      proof-of-concept study, we used a machine learning approach to explore the 
      potential added value of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and patient-generated 
      health data (PGHD) in predicting post-discharge complications for 
      gastrointestinal (GI) and lung cancer surgery patients. METHODS: We formulated 
      post-discharge complication prediction as a binary classification task. Features 
      were extracted from clinical variables, PROs (MD Anderson Symptom Inventory 
      [MDASI]), and PGHD (VivoFit) from a cohort of 52 patients with 134 temporal 
      observation points pre- and post-discharge that were collected from two pilot 
      studies. We trained and evaluated supervised learning classifiers via nested 
      cross-validation. RESULTS: A logistic regression model with L(2) regularization 
      trained with clinical data, PROs and PGHD from wearable pedometers achieved an 
      area under the receiver operating characteristic of 0.74. CONCLUSIONS: PROs and 
      PGHDs captured through remote patient telemonitoring approaches have the 
      potential to improve prediction performance for postoperative complications.

TI  - Enabling Remote Elderly Care: Design and Implementation of a Smart Energy Data 
      System with Activity Recognition.
LID - 10.3390/s23187936 [doi]
LID - 7936
AB  - Seniors face many challenges as they age, such as dementia, cognitive and memory 
      disorders, vision and hearing impairment, among others. Although most of them 
      would like to stay in their own homes, as they feel comfortable and safe, in some 
      cases, older people are taken to special institutions, such as nursing homes. In 
      order to provide serious and quality care to elderly people at home, continuous 
      remote monitoring is perceived as a solution to keep them connected to healthcare 
      service providers. The new trend in medical health services, in general, is to 
      move from 'hospital-centric' services to 'home-centric' services with the aim of 
      reducing the costs of medical treatments and improving the recovery experience of 
      patients, among other benefits for both patients and medical centers. Smart 
      energy data captured from electrical home appliance sensors open a new 
      opportunity for remote healthcare monitoring, linking the patient's 
      health-state/health-condition with routine behaviors and activities over time. It 
      is known that deviation from the normal routine can indicate abnormal conditions 
      such as sleep disturbance, confusion, or memory problems. This work proposes the 
      development and deployment of a smart energy data with activity recognition 
      (SEDAR) system that uses machine learning (ML) techniques to identify appliance 
      usage and behavior patterns oriented to older people living alone. The proposed 
      system opens the door to a range of applications that go beyond healthcare, such 
      as energy management strategies, load balancing techniques, and 
      appliance-specific optimizations. This solution impacts on the massive adoption 
      of telehealth in third-world economies where access to smart meters is still 
      limited.

AB  - Generative pretrained transformer (GPT) tools have been thriving, as ignited by 
      the remarkable success of OpenAI's recent chatbot product. GPT technology offers 
      countless opportunities to significantly improve or renovate current health care 
      research and practice paradigms, especially digital health interventions and 
      digital health-enabled clinical care, and a future of smarter digital health can 
      thus be expected. In particular, GPT technology can be incorporated through 
      various digital health platforms in homes and hospitals embedded with numerous 
      sensors, wearables, and remote monitoring devices. In this viewpoint paper, we 
      highlight recent research progress that depicts the future picture of a smarter 
      digital health ecosystem through GPT-facilitated centralized communications, 
      automated analytics, personalized health care, and instant decision-making.

AB  - COVID-19 is a life-threatening contagious virus that has spread across the globe 
      rapidly. To reduce the outbreak impact of COVID-19 virus illness, continual 
      identification and remote surveillance of patients are essential. Medical service 
      delivery based on the Internet of Things (IoT) technology backed up by the 
      fog-cloud paradigm is an efficient and time-sensitive solution for remote patient 
      surveillance. Conspicuously, a comprehensive framework based on Radio Frequency 
      Identification Device (RFID) and body-wearable sensor technologies supported by 
      the fog-cloud platform is proposed for the identification and management of 
      COVID-19 patients. The J48 decision tree is used to assess the infection degree 
      of the user based on corresponding symptoms. RFID is used to detect Temporal 
      Proximity Interactions (TPI) among users. Using TPI quantification, Temporal 
      Network Analysis is used to analyze and track the current stage of the COVID-19 
      spread. The statistical performance and accuracy of the framework are assessed by 
      utilizing synthetically-generated data for 250,000 users. Based on the 
      comparative analysis, the proposed framework acquired an enhanced measure of 
      classification accuracy, and sensitivity of 96.68% and 94.65% respectively. 
      Moreover, significant improvement has been registered for proposed 
      fog-cloud-based data analysis in terms of Temporal Delay efficacy, Precision, and 
      F-measure.

TI  - Machine Learning-Enabled Environmentally Adaptable Skin-Electronic Sensor for 
      Human Gesture Recognition.
PG  - 9551-9560
LID - 10.1021/acsami.3c18588 [doi]
AB  - Stretchable sensors have been widely investigated and developed for the purpose 
      of human motion detection, touch sensors, and healthcare monitoring, typically 
      converting mechanical/structural deformation into electrical signals. The 
      viscoelastic strain of stretchable materials often results in nonlinear 
      stress-strain characteristics over a broad range of strains, consequently making 
      the stretchable sensors at the body joints less accurate in predicting and 
      recognizing human gestures. Accurate recognition of human gestures can be further 
      deteriorated by environmental changes such as temperature and humidity. Here, we 
      demonstrated an environment-adaptable high stress-strain linearity (up to ε = 
      150%) and high-durability (>100,000 cycles) stretchable sensor conformally 
      laminated onto the body joints for human gesture recognition. The serpentine 
      configuration of our ionic liquid-based stretchable film enabled us to construct 
      broad data sets of mechanical strain and temperature changes for machine 
      learning-based gesture recognition. Signal recognition and training of distinct 
      strains and environmental stimuli using a machine learning-based algorithm 
      analysis successfully measured and predicted the joint motion in a 
      temperature-changing environment with an accuracy of 92.86% (R-squared). 
      Therefore, we believe that our serpentine-shaped ion gel-based stretchable sensor 
      harmonized with machine-learning analysis will be a significant achievement 
      toward environmentally adaptive and multianalyte sensing applications. Our 
      proposed machine learning-enabled multisensor system may enable the development 
      of future electronic devices such as wearable electronics, soft robotics, 
      electronic skin, and human-machine interaction systems.

TI  - Advancements in MXene-based composites for electronic skins.
PG  - 895-915
LID - 10.1039/d3tb02247a [doi]
AB  - MXenes are a class of two-dimensional (2D) materials that have gained significant 
      attention in the field of electronic skins (E-skins). MXene-based composites 
      offer several advantages for E-skins, including high electrical conductivity, 
      mechanical flexibility, transparency, and chemical stability. Their mechanical 
      flexibility allows for conformal integration onto various surfaces, enabling the 
      creation of E-skins that can closely mimic human skin. In addition, their high 
      surface area facilitates enhanced sensitivity and responsiveness to external 
      stimuli, making them ideal for sensing applications. Notably, MXene-based 
      composites can be integrated into E-skins to create sensors that can detect 
      various stimuli, such as temperature, pressure, strain, and humidity. These 
      sensors can be used for a wide range of applications, including health 
      monitoring, robotics, and human-machine interfaces. However, challenges related 
      to scalability, integration, and biocompatibility need to be addressed. One 
      important challenge is achieving long-term stability under harsh conditions such 
      as high humidity. MXenes are susceptible to oxidation, which can degrade their 
      electrical and mechanical properties over time. Another crucial challenge is the 
      scalability of MXene synthesis, as large-scale production methods need to be 
      developed to meet the demand for commercial applications. Notably, the 
      integration of MXenes with other components, such as energy storage devices or 
      flexible electronics, requires further developments to ensure compatibility and 
      optimize overall performance. By addressing issues related to material stability, 
      mechanical flexibility, scalability, sensing performance, and power supply, 
      MXene-based E-skins can develop the fields of healthcare monitoring/diagnostics, 
      prosthetics, motion monitoring, wearable electronics, and human-robot 
      interactions. The integration of MXenes with emerging technologies, such as 
      artificial intelligence or internet of things, can unlock new functionalities and 
      applications for E-skins, ranging from healthcare monitoring to virtual reality 
      interfaces. This review aims to examine the challenges, advantages, and 
      limitations of MXenes and their composites in E-skins, while also exploring the 
      future prospects and potential advancements in this field.

TI  - TELEREHABILITATION OF THE KNEE JOINTS OF PATIENTS WITH POLYTRAUMA.
PG  - 48-51
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim: The overarching theme of this paper is to discuss 
      implementation of the telemedicine technology for rehabilitation of patients with 
      injuries of the lower extremities. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: 
      Consecutive patients were recruited over a four-year period. A total of 48 
      polytrauma patients with lower extremity injuries were enrolled in the study 
      after the resolution of the surgical sequelae. 16 patients from the control group 
      underwent traditional rehabilitation procedures for a 3-week period after injury. 
      A total of 32 subjects were enrolled in the telerehabilitation group for a 3-week 
      study period after injury and were trained with a set of exercises for home use. 
      Home remote monitoring for the 96 test subjects included use of a Portable device 
      with Axis-sensor, temperature and volume sensors, that were fixed to the injured 
      limb. Software permits the monitoring of exercise time, local temperature, the 
      biomechanics of active movements of the injured limb. RESULTS: Results: The 
      orthopedic surgeon during telerehabilitation took significantly less time to 
      consult patients (1.9 minutes) than the traditional rehabilitation (15.2 
      minutes). Patient satisfaction was higher for the telerehabilitation with machine 
      learning algorithm (78.3%) than for the orthopedic surgeon's traditional 
      rehabilitation (36.7%). CONCLUSION: Conclusions: Subjects reported a higher 
      satisfaction with telerehabilitation than with the traditional orthopedic 
      rehabilitation due to the fact that they spent less time at the hospital and had 
      more time for exercises at home under orthopedic remote monitoring. The 
      telerehabilitation system can be used in complex rehabilitation of patients with 
      injuries of the lower extremities.

TI  - Using Wearable Sensors and Machine Learning to Assess Upper Limb Function in 
      Huntington's Disease.
LID - rs.3.rs-4355136 [pii]
LID - 10.21203/rs.3.rs-4355136/v1 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD), like many other neurological disorders, affects both 
      lower and upper limb function that is typically assessed in the clinic - 
      providing a snapshot of disease symptoms. Wearable sensors enable the collection 
      of real-world data that can complement such clinical assessments and provide a 
      more comprehensive insight into disease symptoms. In this context, almost all 
      studies are focused on assessing lower limb function via monitoring of gait, 
      physical activity and ambulation. In this study, we monitor upper limb function 
      during activities of daily living in individuals with HD (n = 16), prodromal HD 
      (pHD, n = 7), and controls (CTR, n = 16) using a wrist-worn wearable sensor, 
      called PAMSys ULM, over seven days. The participants were highly compliant in 
      wearing the sensor with an average daily compliance of 99% (100% for HD, 98% for 
      pHD, and 99% for CTR). Goal-directed movements (GDM) of the hand were detected 
      using a deep learning model, and kinematic features of each GDM were estimated. 
      The collected data was used to predict disease groups (i.e., HD, pHD, and CTR) 
      and clinical scores using a combination of statistical and machine learning-based 
      models. Significant differences in GDM features were observed between the groups. 
      HD participants performed fewer GDMs with long duration (> 7.5 seconds) compared 
      to CTR (p-val = 0.021, d = -0.86). In velocity and acceleration metrics, the 
      highest effect size feature was the entropy of the velocity zero-crossing length 
      segments (HD vs CTR p-val <0.001, d = -1.67; HD vs pHD p-val = 0.043, d=-0.98; 
      CTR vs pHD p-val = 0.046, d=0.96). In addition, this same variable showed a 
      strongest correlation with clinical scores. Classification models achieved good 
      performance in distinguishing HD, pHD and CTR individuals with a balanced 
      accuracy of 67% and a 0.72 recall for the HD group, while regression models 
      accurately predicted clinical scores. Notably the explained variance for the 
      upper extremity function subdomain scale of Unified Huntington's Disease Rating 
      Scale (UHDRS) was the highest, with the model capturing 60% of the variance. Our 
      findings suggest the potential of wearables and machine learning for early 
      identification of phenoconversion, remote monitoring in HD, and evaluating new 
      treatments efficacy in clinical trials and medicine.

AB  - Urinalysis is attractive in non-invasive early diagnosis of bladder cancer 
      compared with clinical gold standard cystoscopy. However, the trace bladder tumor 
      biomarkers in urine and the particularly complex urine environment pose 
      significant challenges for urinalysis. Here, a clinically adoptable urinalysis 
      device that integrates molecular-specificity indium gallium zinc oxide 
      field-effect transistor (IGZO FET) biosensor arrays, a device control panel, and 
      an internet terminal for directly analyzing five bladder-tumor-associated 
      proteins in clinical urine samples, is reported for bladder cancer diagnosis and 
      classification. The IGZO FET biosensors with engineered sensing interfaces 
      provide high sensitivity and selectivity for identification of trace proteins in 
      the complex urine environment. Integrating with a machine-learning algorithm, 
      this device can identify bladder cancer with an accuracy of 95.0% in a cohort of 
      197 patients and 75 non-bladder cancer individuals, distinguishing cancer stages 
      with an overall accuracy of 90.0% and assessing bladder cancer recurrence after 
      surgical treatment. The non-invasive urinalysis device defines a robust 
      technology for remote healthcare and personalized medicine.

      Learning Models.

AB  - In recent days, research in human activity recognition (HAR) has played a 
      significant role in healthcare systems. The accurate activity classification 
      results from the HAR enhance the performance of the healthcare system with broad 
      applications. HAR results are useful in monitoring a person's health, and the 
      system predicts abnormal activities based on user movements. The HAR system's 
      abnormal activity predictions provide better healthcare monitoring and reduce 
      users' health issues. The conventional HAR systems use wearable sensors, such as 
      inertial measurement unit (IMU) and stretch sensors for activity recognition. 
      These approaches show remarkable performances to the user's basic activities such 
      as sitting, standing, and walking. However, when the user performs complex 
      activities, such as running, jumping, and lying, the sensor-based HAR systems 
      have a higher degree of misclassification results due to the reading errors from 
      sensors. These sensor errors reduce the overall performance of the HAR system 
      with the worst classification results. Similarly, radiofrequency or vision-based 
      HAR systems are not free from classification errors when used in real time. In 
      this paper, we address some of the existing challenges of HAR systems by 
      proposing a human image threshing (HIT) machine-based HAR system that uses an 
      image dataset from a smartphone camera for activity recognition. The HIT machine 
      effectively uses a mask region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN) for 
      human body detection, a facial image threshing machine (FIT) for image cropping 
      and resizing, and a deep learning model for activity classification. We 
      demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed HIT machine-based HAR system 
      through extensive experiments and results. The proposed HIT machine achieved 
      98.53% accuracy when the ResNet architecture was used as its deep learning model.

      Cardiopulmonary Care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Innovative models of health care that involve advanced technology in 
      the form of a digital hospital are emerging globally. Models include technology 
      such as machine learning and smart wearables, that can be used to integrate 
      patient data and improve continuity of care. This model may have benefits in 
      situations where patient deterioration must be detected quickly so that a rapid 
      response can occur such as cardiopulmonary settings. AIM: The purpose of this 
      scoping review was to examine the evidence for a digital hospital model of care, 
      in the context of cardiac and pulmonary settings. DESIGN: Scoping review. DATA 
      SOURCES: Databases searched were using PsycInfo, Ovid MEDLINE, and CINAHL. 
      Studies written in English and containing key terms related to digital hospital 
      and cardiopulmonary care were included. The Joanna Briggs Institute methodology 
      for systematic reviews was used to assess the risk of bias. RESULTS: Thirteen 
      (13) studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. For cardiac conditions, a 
      deep-learning-based rapid response system warning system for predicting patient 
      deterioration leading to cardiac arrest had up to 257% higher sensitivity than 
      conventional methods. There was also a reduction in the number of patients who 
      needed to be examined by a physician. Using continuous telemonitoring with a 
      wireless real-time electrocardiogram compared with non-monitoring, there was 
      improved initial resuscitation and 24-hour post-event survival for high-risk 
      patients. However, there were no benefits for survival to discharge. For 
      pulmonary conditions, a natural language processing algorithm reduced the time to 
      asthma diagnosis, demonstrating high predictive values. Virtual inhaler education 
      was found to be as effective as in-person education, and prescription error was 
      reduced following the implementation of computer-based physician order entry 
      electronic medical records and a clinical decision support tool. CONCLUSIONS: 
      While we currently have only a brief glimpse at the impact of technology care 
      delivery for cardiac and respiratory conditions, technology presents an 
      opportunity to improve quality and safety in care, but only with the support of 
      adequate infrastructure and processes. PROTOCOL REGISTRATION: Open Science

TI  - A Clinical Perspective on Bespoke Sensing Mechanisms for Remote Monitoring and 
      Rehabilitation of Neurological Diseases: Scoping Review.
LID - 10.3390/s23010536 [doi]
LID - 536
AB  - Neurological diseases including stroke and neurodegenerative disorders cause a 
      hefty burden on the healthcare system. Survivors experience significant 
      impairment in mobility and daily activities, which requires extensive 
      rehabilitative interventions to assist them to regain lost skills and restore 
      independence. The advent of remote rehabilitation architecture and enabling 
      technology mandates the elaboration of sensing mechanisms tailored to individual 
      clinical needs. This study aims to review current trends in the application of 
      sensing mechanisms in remote monitoring and rehabilitation in neurological 
      diseases, and to provide clinical insights to develop bespoke sensing mechanisms. 
      A systematic search was performed using the PubMED database to identify 16 papers 
      published for the period between 2018 to 2022. Teleceptive sensors (56%) were 
      utilized more often than wearable proximate sensors (50%). The most commonly used 
      modality was infrared (38%) and acceleration force (38%), followed by RGB color, 
      EMG, light and temperature, and radio signal. The strategy adopted to improve the 
      sensing mechanism included a multimodal sensor, the application of multiple 
      sensors, sensor fusion, and machine learning. Most of the stroke studies utilized 
      biofeedback control systems (78%) while the majority of studies for 
      neurodegenerative disorders used sensors for remote monitoring (57%). Functional 
      assessment tools that the sensing mechanism may emulate to produce clinically 
      valid information were proposed and factors affecting user adoption were 
      described. Lastly, the limitations and directions for further development were 
      discussed.

TI  - Automated Myocardial Infarction Screening Using Morphology-Based 
      Electrocardiogram Biomarkers.
PG  - 1-4
LID - 10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10340935 [doi]
AB  - Ischemic heart disease (IHD), a critical and dreadful cardiovascular disease, is 
      a leading cause of death globally. The steady progress of IHD leads to an 
      irreversible condition called myocardial infarction (MI). The detection of MI can 
      be done by observing the altered electrocardiogram (ECG) characteristics. Often, 
      automated ECG analysis is preferred in place of visual inspection to reduce time 
      and ensure reliable detection even when the recording quality is not very good. 
      This paper presents an automated approach to classify recent MI, past MI, and 
      normal sinus rhythm (NSR) classes based on the morphological features of the ECG. 
      In clinical practice, a standard 12-lead ECG setup is typically employed to 
      identify MI. However, acquiring a 12-lead ECG is not always convenient. Hence, in 
      this study, we have explored the possibility of using a minimal number of ECG 
      leads by deriving the augmented limb leads using leads I and II. A well-known and 
      widely used ensemble machine learning tool, the random forest (RF) classifier is 
      trained using features extracted from the derived augmented limb leads and their 
      combinations. An RF classifier built using features extracted from all limb leads 
      has outperformed classifiers built on combinations of them with five-fold 
      cross-validation training accuracy of 97.9 (±0.008) % and testing accuracy of 98 
      %.Clinical relevance- As high sensitivity is reported in identifying recent MI 
      and past MI classes, the proposed approach is suitable for preventative 
      healthcare applications since it is less likely that subjects with recent or past 
      MI will be misclassified. Due to its low computational complexity, better 
      interpretability, and comparable performance to the state-of-the-art results, the 
      proposed approach can be employed in clinical and cardiac health screening 
      applications. It also has the potential to be employed in remote monitoring with 
      mobile and wearable devices because it is built on features extracted from only 
      lead I and II ECG recordings.

AB  - Early prediction of patient mortality risks during a pandemic can decrease 
      mortality by assuring efficient resource allocation and treatment planning. This 
      study aimed to develop and compare prognosis prediction machine learning models 
      based on invasive laboratory and noninvasive clinical and demographic data from 
      patients' day of admission. Three Support Vector Machine (SVM) models were 
      developed and compared using invasive, non-invasive, and both groups. The results 
      suggested that non-invasive features could provide mortality predictions that are 
      similar to the invasive and roughly on par with the joint model. Feature 
      inspection results from SVM-RFE and sparsity analysis displayed that, compared 
      with the invasive model, the non-invasive model can provide better performances 
      with a fewer number of features, pointing to the presence of high predictive 
      information contents in several non-invasive features, including SPO2, age, and 
      cardiovascular disorders. Furthermore, while the invasive model was able to 
      provide better mortality predictions for the imminent future, non-invasive 
      features displayed better performance for more distant expiration intervals. 
      Early mortality prediction using non-invasive models can give us insights as to 
      where and with whom to intervene. Combined with novel technologies, such as 
      wireless wearable devices, these models can create powerful frameworks for 
      various medical assignments and patient triage.

TI  - E-Health in Hypertension Management: an Insight into the Current and Future Role 
      of Blood Pressure Telemonitoring.
PG  - 42
LID - 10.1007/s11906-020-01056-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Out-of-office blood pressure (BP) monitoring techniques, 
      including home and ambulatory BP monitoring, are currently recommended by 
      hypertension guidelines worldwide to confirm the diagnosis of hypertension and to 
      monitor the appropriateness of treatment. However, such techniques are not always 
      effectively implemented or timely available in the routine clinical practice. In 
      recent years, the widespread availability of e-health solutions has stimulated 
      the development of blood pressure telemonitoring (BPT) systems, which allow 
      remote BP tracking and tighter and more efficient monitoring of patients' health 
      status. RECENT FINDINGS: There is currently strong evidence that BPT may be of 
      benefit for hypertension screening and diagnosis and for improving hypertension 
      management. The advantage is more significant when BPT is coupled with multimodal 
      interventions involving a physician, a nurse or pharmacist, and including 
      education on lifestyle and risk factors and drug management. Several randomized 
      controlled studies documented enhanced hypertension management and improved BP 
      control of hypertensive patients through BPT. Potential additional effects of BPT 
      are represented by improved compliance to treatment, intensification, and 
      optimization of drug use, improved quality of life, reduction in risk of 
      developing cardiovascular complications, and cost-saving. Applications based on 
      m-health and making use of wearables or smartwatches integrated with machine 
      learning models are particularly promising for the future development of 
      efficient BPT solutions, and they will provide remarkable support decision tools 
      for doctors. BPT and telehealth will soon disrupt hypertension management. 
      However, which approach will be the most effective and whether it will be 
      sustainable in the long-term still need to be elucidated.

TI  - Predicting Outcomes in Patients Undergoing Pancreatectomy Using Wearable 
      Technology and Machine Learning: Prospective Cohort Study.
PG  - e23595

LID - e23595
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related 
      deaths, and although pancreatectomy is currently the only curative treatment, it 
      is associated with significant morbidity. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study 
      was to evaluate the utility of wearable telemonitoring technologies to predict 
      treatment outcomes using patient activity metrics and machine learning. METHODS: 
      In this prospective, single-center, single-cohort study, patients scheduled for 
      pancreatectomy were provided with a wearable telemonitoring device to be worn 
      prior to surgery. Patient clinical data were collected and all patients were 
      evaluated using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality 
      Improvement Program surgical risk calculator (ACS-NSQIP SRC). Machine learning 
      models were developed to predict whether patients would have a textbook outcome 
      and compared with the ACS-NSQIP SRC using area under the receiver operating 
      characteristic (AUROC) curves. RESULTS: Between February 2019 and February 2020, 
      48 patients completed the study. Patient activity metrics were collected over an 
      average of 27.8 days before surgery. Patients took an average of 4162.1 (SD 
      4052.6) steps per day and had an average heart rate of 75.6 (SD 14.8) beats per 
      minute. Twenty-eight (58%) patients had a textbook outcome after pancreatectomy. 
      The group of 20 (42%) patients who did not have a textbook outcome included 14 
      patients with severe complications and 11 patients requiring readmission. The 
      ACS-NSQIP SRC had an AUROC curve of 0.6333 to predict failure to achieve a 
      textbook outcome, while our model combining patient clinical characteristics and 
      patient activity data achieved the highest performance with an AUROC curve of 
      0.7875. CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning models outperformed ACS-NSQIP SRC estimates 
      in predicting textbook outcomes after pancreatectomy. The highest performance was 
      observed when machine learning models incorporated patient clinical 
      characteristics and activity metrics.

AB  - Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by several 
      motor symptoms that develop gradually: tremor, bradykinesia, limb rigidity, and 
      gait and balance problems. While there is no cure, levodopa therapy has been 
      shown to mitigate symptoms. A patient on levodopa experiences cycles in the 
      severity of their symptoms, characterized by an ON state-when the drug is 
      active-and an OFF state-when symptoms worsen as the drug wears off. The 
      longitudinal progression of the disease is monitored using episodic assessments 
      performed by trained physicians in the clinic, such as the Unified Parkinson's 
      Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Lately, there has been an effort in the field to 
      develop continuous, objective measures of motor symptoms based on wearable 
      sensors and other remote monitoring devices. In this work, we present an effort 
      towards such a solution that uses a single wearable inertial sensor to 
      automatically assess the postural instability and gait disorder (PIGD) of a 
      Parkinson's disease patient. Sensor data was collected from two independent 
      studies of subjects performing the UPDRS test and then used to train and validate 
      a convolutional neural network model. Given the typical limited size of such 
      studies we also employed the use of generative adversarial networks to improve 
      the performance of deep-learning models that usually require larger amounts of 
      data for training. We show that for a 2-min walk test, our method's predicted 
      PIGD scores can be used to identify a patient's ON/OFF states better than a 
      physician evaluated on the same criteria. This result paves the way for more 
      reliable, continuous tracking of Parkinson's disease symptoms.

TI  - Fog Computing Service in the Healthcare Monitoring System for Managing the 
      Real-Time Notification.
PG  - 5337733

AB  - A new computing paradigm that has been growing in computing systems is fog 
      computing. In the healthcare industry, Internet of Things (IoT) driven fog 
      computing is being developed to speed up the services for the general public and 
      save billions of lives. This new computing platform, based on the fog computing 
      paradigm, may reduce latency when transmitting and communicating signals with 
      faraway servers, allowing medical services to be delivered more quickly in both 
      spatial and temporal dimensions. One of the necessary qualities of computing 
      systems that can enable the completion of healthcare operations is latency 
      reduction. Fog computing can provide reduced latency when compared to cloud 
      computing due to the use of only low-end computers, mobile phones, and personal 
      devices in fog computing. In this paper, a new framework for healthcare 
      monitoring for managing real-time notification based on fog computing has been 
      proposed. The proposed system monitors the patient's body temperature, heart 
      rate, and blood pressure values obtained from the sensors that are embedded into 
      a wearable device and notifies the doctors or caregivers in real time if there 
      occur any contradictions in the normal threshold value using the machine learning 
      algorithms. The notification can also be set for the patients to alert them about 
      the periodical medications or diet to be maintained by the patients. The cloud 
      layer stores the big data into the cloud for future references for the hospitals 
      and the researchers.

AB  - Mobile health (mHealth) has recently had significant advances in tele-dermatology 
      (TD) thanks to the developments following the COVID-19 pandemic. This topic is 
      very important, as telemedicine and mHealth, when applied to dermatology, could 
      improve both the quality of healthcare for citizens and the workflow in the 
      health domain. The proposed study was centered on the last three years. We 
      conducted an overview on the opportunities, the perspectives, and the problems 
      involved in TD integration with mHealth. The methodology of the narrative review 
      was based on: (I) a search of PubMed and Scopus and (II) an eligibility 
      assessment, using properly proposed parameters. The outcome of the study showed 
      that during the COVID-19 pandemic, TD integration with mHealth advanced rapidly. 
      This integration enabled the monitoring of dermatological problems and 
      facilitated remote specialist visits, reducing face-to-face interactions. AI and 
      mobile apps have empowered citizens to take an active role in their healthcare. 
      This differs from other imaging sectors where information exchange is limited to 
      professionals. The opportunities for TD in mHealth include improving service 
      quality, streamlining healthcare processes, reducing costs, and providing more 
      accessible care. It can be applied to various conditions, such as (but not 
      limited to) acne, vitiligo, psoriasis, and skin cancers. Integration with AI and 
      augmented reality (AR), as well as the use of wearable sensors, are anticipated 
      as future developments. However, integrating TD with mHealth also brings about 
      problems and challenges related to regulations, ethics, cybersecurity, data 
      privacy, and device management. Scholars and policymakers need to address these 
      issues while involving citizens in the process.

AB  - Hybridization of low-dimensional components with diverse geometrical dimensions 
      should offer an opportunity for the discovery of synergistic nanocomposite 
      structures. In this regard, how to establish a reliable interfacial interaction 
      is the key requirement for the successful integration of geometrically different 
      components. Here, we present 1D/2D heterodimensional hybrids via dopant induced 
      hybridization of 2D Ti(3)C(2)T(x) MXene with 1D nitrogen-doped graphene 
      nanoribbon. Edge abundant nanoribbon structures allow a high level nitrogen 
      doping (∼6.8 at%), desirable for the strong coordination interaction with 
      Ti(3)C(2)T(x) MXene surface. For piezoresistive pressure sensor application, 
      strong adhesion between the conductive layers and at the conductive 
      layer/elastomer interface significantly diminishes the sensing hysteresis down to 
      1.33% and enhances the sensing stability up to 10 000 cycles at high pressure 
      (100 kPa). Moreover, large-area pressure sensor array reveals a high potential 
      for smart seat cushion-based posture monitoring application with high accuracy 
      (>95%) by exploiting machine learning algorithm.

AB  - Smart home monitoring systems via internet of things (IoT) are required for 
      taking care of elders at home. They provide the flexibility of monitoring elders 
      remotely for their families and caregivers. Activities of daily living are an 
      efficient way to effectively monitor elderly people at home and patients at 
      caregiving facilities. The monitoring of such actions depends largely on 
      IoT-based devices, either wireless or installed at different places. This paper 
      proposes an effective and robust layered architecture using multisensory devices 
      to recognize the activities of daily living from anywhere. Multimodality refers 
      to the sensory devices of multiple types working together to achieve the 
      objective of remote monitoring. Therefore, the proposed multimodal-based approach 
      includes IoT devices, such as wearable inertial sensors and videos recorded 
      during daily routines, fused together. The data from these multi-sensors have to 
      be processed through a pre-processing layer through different stages, such as 
      data filtration, segmentation, landmark detection, and 2D stick model. In next 
      layer called the features processing, we have extracted, fused, and optimized 
      different features from multimodal sensors. The final layer, called 
      classification, has been utilized to recognize the activities of daily living via 
      a deep learning technique known as convolutional neural network. It is observed 
      from the proposed IoT-based multimodal layered system's results that an 
      acceptable mean accuracy rate of 84.14% has been achieved.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic manifested the need of 
      developing robust digital platforms for facilitating healthcare services such as 
      consultancy, clinical therapies, real time remote monitoring, early diagnosis and 
      future predictions. Innovations made using technologies such as Internet of 
      Things (IoT), edge computing, cloud computing and artificial intelligence are 
      helping address this crisis. The urge for remote monitoring, symptom analysis and 
      early detection of diseases lead to tremendous increase in the deployment of 
      wearable sensor devices. They facilitate seamless gathering of physiological data 
      such as electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, respiration traces (RESP), galvanic skin 
      response (GSR), pulse rate, body temperature, photoplethysmograms (PPG), oxygen 
      saturation (SpO2) etc. For diagnosis and analysis purpose, the gathered data 
      needs to be stored. Wearable devices operate on batteries and have a memory 
      constraint. In mHealth application architectures, this gathered data is hence 
      stored on cloud based servers. While transmitting data from wearable devices to 
      cloud servers via edge devices, a lot of energy is consumed. This paper proposes 
      a deep learning based compression model SCAElite that reduces the data volume, 
      enabling energy efficient transmission. RESULTS: Stress Recognition in Automobile 
      Drivers dataset and MIT-BIH dataset from PhysioNet are used for validation of 
      algorithm performance. The model achieves a compression ratio of up to 300 fold 
      with reconstruction errors within 8% over the stress recognition dataset and 
      106.34-fold with reconstruction errors within 8% over the MIT-BIH dataset. The 
      computational complexity of SCAElite is 51.65% less compared to state-of-the-art 
      deep compressive model. CONCLUSION: It is experimentally validated that SCAElite 
      guarantees a high compression ratio with good quality restoration capabilities 
      for physiological signal compression in mHealth applications. It has a compact 
      architecture and is computationally more efficient compared to state-of-the-art 
      deep compressive model.

TI  - Detection of Low Back Physiotherapy Exercises With Inertial Sensors and Machine 
      Learning: Algorithm Development and Validation.
PG  - e38689
LID - 10.2196/38689 [doi]
LID - e38689
AB  - BACKGROUND: Physiotherapy is a critical element in the successful conservative 
      management of low back pain (LBP). A gold standard for quantitatively measuring 
      physiotherapy participation is crucial to understanding physiotherapy adherence 
      in managing recovery from LBP. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and 
      evaluate a system with wearable inertial sensors to objectively detect the 
      performance of unsupervised exercises for LBP comprising movement in multiple 
      planes and sitting postures. METHODS: A quantitative classification design was 
      used within a machine learning framework to detect exercise performance and 
      posture in a cohort of healthy participants. A set of 8 inertial sensors were 
      placed on the participants, and data were acquired as they performed 7 McKenzie 
      low back exercises and 3 sitting posture positions. Engineered time series 
      features were extracted from the data and used to train 9 models by using a 
      6-fold cross-validation approach, from which the best 2 models were selected for 
      further study. In addition, a convolutional neural network was trained directly 
      on the time series data. A feature importance analysis was performed to identify 
      sensor locations and channels that contributed the most to the models. Finally, a 
      subset of sensor locations and channels was included in a hyperparameter grid 
      search to identify the optimal sensor configuration and best performing 
      algorithms for exercise and posture classification. The final models were 
      evaluated using the F(1) score in a 10-fold cross-validation approach. RESULTS: 
      In total, 19 healthy adults with no history of LBP each completed at least one 
      full session of exercises and postures. Random forest and XGBoost (extreme 
      gradient boosting) models performed the best out of the initial set of 9 
      engineered feature models. The optimal hardware configuration was identified as a 
      3-sensor setup-lower back, left thigh, and right ankle sensors with acceleration, 
      gyroscope, and magnetometer channels. The XGBoost model achieved the highest 
      exercise (F(1) score: mean 0.94, SD 0.03) and posture (F(1) score: mean 0.90, SD 
      0.11) classification scores. The convolutional neural network achieved similar 
      results with the same sensor locations, using only the accelerometer and 
      gyroscope channels for exercise classification (F(1) score: mean 0.94, SD 0.02) 
      and the accelerometer channel alone for posture classification (F(1) score: mean 
      0.88, SD 0.07). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the potential of a 3-sensor 
      lower body wearable solution (eg, smart pants) that can identify exercises in 
      multiple planes and proper sitting postures, which is suitable for the treatment 
      of LBP. This technology has the potential to improve the effectiveness of LBP 
      rehabilitation by facilitating quantitative feedback, early problem diagnosis, 
      and possible remote monitoring.

TI  - Digital Biomarkers of Physical Frailty and Frailty Phenotypes Using Sensor-Based 
      Physical Activity and Machine Learning.
LID - 10.3390/s21165289 [doi]
LID - 5289
AB  - Remote monitoring of physical frailty is important to personalize care for 
      slowing down the frailty process and/or for the healthy recovery of older adults 
      following acute or chronic stressors. Taking the Fried frailty criteria as a 
      reference to determine physical frailty and frailty phenotypes (slowness, 
      weakness, exhaustion, inactivity), this study aimed to explore the benefit of 
      machine learning to determine the least number of digital biomarkers of physical 
      frailty measurable from a pendant sensor during activities of daily living. Two 
      hundred and fifty-nine older adults were classified into robust or 
      pre-frail/frail groups based on the physical frailty assessments by the Fried 
      frailty criteria. All participants wore a pendant sensor at the sternum level for 
      48 h. Of seventeen sensor-derived features extracted from a pendant sensor, 
      fourteen significant features were used for machine learning based on logistic 
      regression modeling and a recursive feature elimination technique incorporating 
      bootstrapping. The combination of percentage time standing, percentage time 
      walking, walking cadence, and longest walking bout were identified as optimal 
      digital biomarkers of physical frailty and frailty phenotypes. These findings 
      suggest that a combination of sensor-measured exhaustion, inactivity, and speed 
      have potential to screen and monitor people for physical frailty and frailty 
      phenotypes.

AB  - Recently, flexible wearable electronic devices have attracted immense interest as 
      an alternative for conventional rigid metallic conductors in personal healthcare 
      monitoring, human motion detection, and sensory skins, owing to their intrinsic 
      characteristics. However, the practical applications of most wearable sensors are 
      generally limited by their poor stretchability and sensitivity, unsatisfactory 
      strength, lower conductivity, and single sensory function. Here a hydrogen bond 
      cross-linked network based on carboxylic styrene butadiene rubber (XSBR) and 
      hydrophilic sericin (SS) non-covalently modified carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is 
      rationally designed and then fabricated into multi-functional sensors. The 
      resultant versatile sensors are able to detect both weak and large deformations, 
      which owns a low detection limit of 1% strain, high stretchability up to 217%, 
      superior strength of 12.58 MPa, high sensitivity with a gauge factor up to 25.98, 
      high conductivity of 0.071 S m(-1) , and lower percolation threshold of 0.504 
      wt%. Moreover, the prepared sensors also possess an impressively thermal response 
      (0.01636 °C(-1) ) and realize the application in the measurement of human body 
      temperature. The multifunctional and scalable XSBR/SSCNT sensor with the 
      integrated tracking capabilities of real-time and in situ physiological signals, 
      providing a promising route to develop wearable artificial intelligence in human 
      health and sporting applications.

TI  - A Low-Cost Wearable Device to Estimate Body Temperature Based on Wrist 
      Temperature.
LID - 10.3390/s24061944 [doi]
LID - 1944
AB  - The remote monitoring of vital signs and healthcare provision has become an 
      urgent necessity due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the world. Blood 
      oxygen level, heart rate, and body temperature data are crucial for managing the 
      disease and ensuring timely medical care. This study proposes a low-cost wearable 
      device employing non-contact sensors to monitor, process, and visualize critical 
      variables, focusing on body temperature measurement as a key health indicator. 
      The wearable device developed offers a non-invasive and continuous method to 
      gather wrist and forehead temperature data. However, since there is a discrepancy 
      between wrist and actual forehead temperature, this study incorporates 
      statistical methods and machine learning to estimate the core forehead 
      temperature from the wrist. This research collects 2130 samples from 30 
      volunteers, and both the statistical least squares method and machine learning 
      via linear regression are applied to analyze these data. It is observed that all 
      models achieve a significant fit, but the third-degree polynomial model stands 
      out in both approaches. It achieves an R(2) value of 0.9769 in the statistical 
      analysis and 0.9791 in machine learning.

TI  - Evaluating a Remote Monitoring Program for Respiratory Diseases: Prospective 
      Observational Study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic respiratory diseases and those in the 
      postdischarge period following hospitalization because of COVID-19 are 
      particularly vulnerable, and little is known about the changes in their symptoms 
      and physiological parameters. Continuous remote monitoring of physiological 
      parameters and symptom changes offers the potential for timely intervention, 
      improved patient outcomes, and reduced health care costs. OBJECTIVE: This study 
      investigated whether a real-time multimodal program using commercially available 
      wearable technology, home-based Bluetooth-enabled spirometers, finger pulse 
      oximeters, and smartphone apps is feasible and acceptable for patients with 
      chronic respiratory diseases, as well as the value of low-burden, long-term 
      passive data collection. METHODS: In a 3-arm prospective observational cohort 
      feasibility study, we recruited 60 patients from the Royal Free Hospital and 
      University College Hospital. These patients had been diagnosed with interstitial 
      lung disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or post-COVID-19 condition 
      (n=20 per group) and were followed for 180 days. This study used a comprehensive 
      remote monitoring system designed to provide real-time and relevant data for both 
      patients and clinicians. Data were collected using REDCap (Research Electronic 
      Data Capture; Vanderbilt University) periodic surveys, Remote Assessment of 
      Disease and Relapses-base active app questionnaires, wearables, finger pulse 
      oximeters, smartphone apps, and Bluetooth home-based spirometry. The feasibility 
      of remote monitoring was measured through adherence to the protocol, engagement 
      during the follow-up period, retention rate, acceptability, and data integrity. 
      RESULTS: Lowest-burden passive data collection methods, via wearables, 
      demonstrated superior adherence, engagement, and retention compared with active 
      data collection methods, with an average wearable use of 18.66 (SD 4.69) hours 
      daily (77.8% of the day), 123.91 (SD 33.73) hours weekly (72.6% of the week), and 
      463.82 (SD 156.70) hours monthly (64.4% of the month). Highest-burden spirometry 
      tasks and high-burden active app tasks had the lowest adherence, engagement, and 
      retention, followed by low-burden questionnaires. Spirometry and active 
      questionnaires had the lowest retention at 0.5 survival probability, indicating 
      that they were the most burdensome. Adherence to and quality of home spirometry 
      were analyzed; of the 7200 sessions requested, 4248 (59%) were performed. Of 
      these, 90.3% (3836/4248) were of acceptable quality according to American 
      Thoracic Society grading. Inclusion of protocol holidays improved retention 
      measures. The technologies used were generally well received. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      findings provide evidence supporting the feasibility and acceptability of remote 
      monitoring for capturing both subjective and objective data from various sources 
      for respiratory diseases. The high engagement level observed with passively 
      collected data suggests the potential of wearables for long-term, user-friendly 
      remote monitoring in respiratory disease management. The unique piloting of 
      certain features such as protocol holidays, alert notifications for missing data, 
      and flexible support from the study team provides a reference for future studies 
      in this field. INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID):

TI  - Development and Validation of a Machine Learning Model Predicting Arteriovenous 
      Fistula Failure in a Large Network of Dialysis Clinics.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph182312355 [doi]
LID - 12355
AB  - Background: Vascular access surveillance of dialysis patients is a challenging 
      task for clinicians. We derived and validated an arteriovenous fistula failure 
      model (AVF-FM) based on machine learning. Methods: The AVF-FM is an XG-Boost 
      algorithm aimed at predicting AVF failure within three months among in-centre 
      dialysis patients. The model was trained in the derivation set (70% of initial 
      cohort) by exploiting the information routinely collected in the Nephrocare 
      European Clinical Database (EuCliD(®)). Model performance was tested by 
      concordance statistic and calibration charts in the remaining 30% of records. 
      Features importance was computed using the SHAP method. Results: We included 
      13,369 patients, overall. The Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC) of AVF-FM was 
      0.80 (95% CI 0.79-0.81). Model calibration showed excellent representation of 
      observed failure risk. Variables associated with the greatest impact on risk 
      estimates were previous history of AVF complications, followed by access 
      recirculation and other functional parameters including metrics describing 
      temporal pattern of dialysis dose, blood flow, dynamic venous and arterial 
      pressures. Conclusions: The AVF-FM achieved good discrimination and calibration 
      properties by combining routinely collected clinical and sensor data that require 
      no additional effort by healthcare staff. Therefore, it can potentially enable 
      risk-based personalization of AVF surveillance strategies.

TI  - Ultra-Wideband Radar-Based Indoor Activity Monitoring for Elderly Care.
LID - 10.3390/s21093158 [doi]
LID - 3158
AB  - In this paper, we propose an unobtrusive method and architecture for monitoring a 
      person's presence and collecting his/her health-related parameters simultaneously 
      in a home environment. The system is based on using a single ultra-wideband (UWB) 
      impulse-radar as a sensing device. Using UWB radars, we aim to recognize a person 
      and some preselected movements without camera-type monitoring. Via the 
      experimental work, we have also demonstrated that, by using a UWB signal, it is 
      possible to detect small chest movements remotely to recognize coughing, for 
      example. In addition, based on statistical data analysis, a person's posture in a 
      room can be recognized in a steady situation. In addition, we implemented a 
      machine learning technique (k-nearest neighbour) to automatically classify a 
      static posture using UWB radar data. Skewness, kurtosis and received power are 
      used in posture classification during the postprocessing. The classification 
      accuracy achieved is more than 99%. In this paper, we also present reliability 
      and fault tolerance analyses for three kinds of UWB radar network architectures 
      to point out the weakest item in the installation. This information is highly 
      important in the system's implementation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: e-Health has played a crucial role during the COVID-19 pandemic in 
      primary health care. e-Health is the cost-effective and secure use of Information 
      and Communication Technologies (ICTs) to support health and health-related 
      fields. Various stakeholders worldwide use ICTs, including individuals, 
      non-profit organizations, health practitioners, and governments. As a result of 
      the COVID-19 pandemic, ICT has improved the quality of healthcare, the exchange 
      of information, training of healthcare professionals and patients, and 
      facilitated the relationship between patients and healthcare providers. This 
      study systematically reviews the literature on ICT-based automatic and remote 
      monitoring methods, as well as different ICT techniques used in the care of 
      COVID-19-infected patients. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this systematic literature 
      review is to identify the e-Health methods, associated ICTs, method 
      implementation strategies, information collection techniques, advantages, and 
      disadvantages of remote and automatic patient monitoring and care in COVID-19 
      pandemic. METHODS: The search included primary studies that were published 
      between January 2020 and June 2022 in scientific and electronic databases, such 
      as EBSCOhost, Scopus, ACM, Nature, SpringerLink, IEEE Xplore, MEDLINE, Google 
      Scholar, JMIR, Web of Science, Science Direct, and PubMed. In this review, the 
      findings from the included publications are presented and elaborated according to 
      the identified research questions. Evidence-based systematic reviews and 
      meta-analyses were conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
      Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework. Additionally, we improved the 
      review process using the Rayyan tool and the Scale for the Assessment of 
      Narrative Review Articles (SANRA). Among the eligibility criteria were 
      methodological rigor, conceptual clarity, and useful implementation of ICTs in 
      e-Health for remote and automatic monitoring of COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Our 
      initial search identified 664 potential studies; 102 were assessed for 
      eligibility in the pre-final stage and 65 articles were used in the final review 
      with the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The review identified the following 
      eHealth methods-Telemedicine, Mobile Health (mHealth), and Telehealth. The 
      associated ICTs are Wearable Body Sensors, Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
      algorithms, Internet-of-Things, or Internet-of-Medical-Things (IoT or IoMT), 
      Biometric Monitoring Technologies (BioMeTs), and Bluetooth-enabled (BLE) home 
      health monitoring devices. Spatial or positional data, personal and individual 
      health, and wellness data, including vital signs, symptoms, biomedical images and 
      signals, and lifestyle data are examples of information that is managed by ICTs. 
      Different AI and IoT methods have opened new possibilities for automatic and 
      remote patient monitoring with associated advantages and weaknesses. Our findings 
      were represented in a structured manner using a semantic knowledge graph (e.g., 
      ontology model). CONCLUSIONS: Various e-Health methods, related remote monitoring 
      technologies, different approaches, information categories, the adoption of ICT 
      tools for an automatic remote patient monitoring (RPM), advantages and 
      limitations of RMTs in the COVID-19 case are discussed in this review. The use of 
      e-Health during the COVID-19 pandemic illustrates the constraints and 
      possibilities of using ICTs. ICTs are not merely an external tool to achieve 
      definite remote and automatic health monitoring goals; instead, they are embedded 
      in contexts. Therefore, the importance of the mutual design process between ICT 
      and society during the global health crisis has been observed from a social 
      informatics perspective. A global health crisis can be observed as an information 
      crisis (e.g., insufficient information, unreliable information, and inaccessible 
      information); however, this review shows the influence of ICTs on COVID-19 
      patients' health monitoring and related information collection techniques.

AB  - On account of privacy preserving issue and health-care monitoring, physiological 
      signal biometric authentication system has gained popularity in recent years. 
      Seismocardiogram (SCG) is now easily accessible owing to the advance of wearable 
      sensor technology. However, SCG biometric has not been widely explored due to the 
      challenging motion artifact removal. In this paper, we design placing the sensors 
      at different body parts under different activities to determine the best sensor 
      location. In addition, we develop SCG noise removal algorithm and utilize machine 
      learning approach to perform biometric authentication tasks. We validate the 
      proposed methods on 20 healthy young adults. The dataset contains acceleration 
      data of sitting, standing, walking, and sitting post-exercise activities with the 
      sensor placed at the wrists, neck, heart and sternum. We demonstrate that 
      vertical and dorsal-ventral SCG near the heart and the sternum produce reliable 
      SCG biometric evidenced by achieving the state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, 
      we present the efficacy of the devised noise removal procedure in the 
      authentication during walking motion.Clinical relevance- A 
      seismocardiography-based biometric authentication system can help serve privacy 
      preserving and reveal cardiovascular functioning information in clinics.

TI  - Deep learning enabled classification of real-time respiration signals acquired by 
      MoSSe quantum dot-based flexible sensors.
PG  - 6870-6880
LID - 10.1039/d1tb01237a [doi]
AB  - Respiration rate is a vital parameter which is useful for the earlier 
      identification of diseases. In this context, various types of devices have been 
      fabricated and developed to monitor different breath rates. However, the 
      disposability and biocompatibility of such sensors and the poor classification of 
      different breath rates from sensor data are significant issues in medical 
      services. This report attempts to focus on two important things: the 
      classification of respiration signals from sensor data using deep learning and 
      the disposability of devices. The use of the novel Janus MoSSe quantum dot (MoSSe 
      QD) structure allows for stable respiration sensing because of unchanged wear 
      rates under humid conditions, and also, the electron affinity and work function 
      values suggest that MoSSe has a higher tendency to donate electrons and interact 
      with the hydrogen molecule. Furthermore, for the real-time classification of 
      different respiration signals, a 1D convolutional neural network (1D CNN) was 
      incorporated. This algorithm was applied to four different breath patterns which 
      achieved a state-of-the-art 10-trial accuracy of 98.18% for normal, 95.25% for 
      slow, 97.64% for deep, and 98.18% for fast breaths. The successful demonstration 
      of a stable, low-cost, and disposable respiration sensor with a highly accurate 
      classification of signals is a major step ahead in developing wearable 
      respiration sensors for future personal healthcare monitoring systems.

TI  - A review on utilizing machine learning technology in the fields of electronic 
      emergency triage and patient priority systems in telemedicine: Coherent taxonomy, 
      motivations, open research challenges and recommendations for intelligent future 
      work.

AB  - BACKGROUND: With the remarkable increasing in the numbers of patients, the 
      triaging and prioritizing patients into multi-emergency level is required to 
      accommodate all the patients, save more lives, and manage the medical resources 
      effectively. Triaging and prioritizing patients becomes particularly challenging 
      especially for the patients who are far from hospital and use telemedicine 
      system. To this end, the researchers exploiting the useful tool of machine 
      learning to address this challenge. Hence, carrying out an intensive 
      investigation and in-depth study in the field of using machine learning in 
      E-triage and patient priority are essential and required. OBJECTIVES: This 
      research aims to (1) provide a literature review and an in-depth study on the 
      roles of machine learning in the fields of electronic emergency triage (E-triage) 
      and prioritize patients for fast healthcare services in telemedicine 
      applications. (2) highlight the effectiveness of machine learning methods in 
      terms of algorithms, medical input data, output results, and machine learning 
      goals in remote healthcare telemedicine systems. (3) present the relationship 
      between machine learning goals and the electronic triage processes specifically 
      on the: triage levels, medical features for input, outcome results as outputs, 
      and the relevant diseases. (4), the outcomes of our analyses are subjected to 
      organize and propose a cross-over taxonomy between machine learning algorithms 
      and telemedicine structure. (5) present lists of motivations, open research 
      challenges and recommendations for future intelligent work for both academic and 
      industrial sectors in telemedicine and remote healthcare applications. METHODS: 
      An intensive research is carried out by reviewing all articles related to the 
      field of E-triage and remote priority systems that utilise machine learning 
      algorithms and sensors. We have searched all related keywords to investigate the 
      databases of Science Direct, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, PubMed, and Medline for 
      the articles, which have been published from January 2012 up to date. RESULTS: A 
      new crossover matching between machine learning methods and telemedicine taxonomy 
      is proposed. The crossover-taxonomy is developed in this study to identify the 
      relationship between machine learning algorithm and the equivalent telemedicine 
      categories whereas the machine learning algorithm has been utilized. The impact 
      of utilizing machine learning is composed in proposing the telemedicine 
      architecture based on synchronous (real-time/ online) and asynchronous 
      (store-and-forward / offline) structure. In addition to that, list of machine 
      learning algorithms, list of the performance metrics, list of inputs data and 
      outputs results are presented. Moreover, open research challenges, the benefits 
      of utilizing machine learning and the recommendations for new research 
      opportunities that need to be addressed for the synergistic integration of 
      multidisciplinary works are organized and presented accordingly. DISCUSSION: The 
      state-of-the-art studies on the E-triage and priority systems that utilise 
      machine learning algorithms in telemedicine architecture are discussed. This 
      approach allows the researchers to understand the modernisation of healthcare 
      systems and the efficient use of artificial intelligence and machine learning. In 
      particular, the growing worldwide population and various chronic diseases such as 
      heart chronic diseases, blood pressure and diabetes, require smart health 
      monitoring systems in E-triage and priority systems, in which machine learning 
      algorithms could be greatly beneficial. CONCLUSIONS: Although research directions 
      on E-triage and priority systems that use machine learning algorithms in 
      telemedicine vary, they are equally essential and should be considered. Hence, we 
      provide a comprehensive review to emphasise the advantages of the existing 
      research in multidisciplinary works of artificial intelligence, machine learning 
      and healthcare services.

AB  - Noncommunicable diseases (NCD), such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular 
      disease, are defining healthcare challenges of the 21st century. Medical 
      infrastructure, which for decades sought to reduce the incidence and severity of 
      communicable diseases, has proven insufficient in meeting the intensive, 
      long-term monitoring needs of many NCD disease patient groups. In addition, 
      existing portable devices with rigid electronics are still limited in clinical 
      use due to unreliable data, limited functionality, and lack of continuous 
      measurement ability. Here, a wearable system for at-home cardiovascular 
      monitoring of postpartum women-a group with urgently unmet NCD needs in the 
      United States-using a cloud-integrated soft sternal device with conformal 
      nanomembrane sensors is introduced. A supporting mobile application provides 
      device data to a custom cloud architecture for real-time waveform analytics, 
      including medical device-grade blood pressure prediction via deep learning, and 
      shares the results with both patient and clinician to complete a robust and 
      highly scalable remote monitoring ecosystem. Validated in a month-long clinical 
      study with 20 postpartum Black women, the system demonstrates its ability to 
      remotely monitor existing disease progression, stratify patient risk, and augment 
      clinical decision-making by informing interventions for groups whose healthcare 
      needs otherwise remain unmet in standard clinical practice.

TI  - Gynecology Meets Big Data in the Disruptive Innovation Medical Era: State-of-Art 
      and Future Prospects.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18105058 [doi]
LID - 5058
AB  - Tremendous scientific and technological achievements have been revolutionizing 
      the current medical era, changing the way in which physicians practice their 
      profession and deliver healthcare provisions. This is due to the convergence of 
      various advancements related to digitalization and the use of information and 
      communication technologies (ICTs)-ranging from the internet of things (IoT) and 
      the internet of medical things (IoMT) to the fields of robotics, virtual and 
      augmented reality, and massively parallel and cloud computing. Further progress 
      has been made in the fields of addictive manufacturing and three-dimensional (3D) 
      printing, sophisticated statistical tools such as big data visualization and 
      analytics (BDVA) and artificial intelligence (AI), the use of mobile and 
      smartphone applications (apps), remote monitoring and wearable sensors, and 
      e-learning, among others. Within this new conceptual framework, big data 
      represents a massive set of data characterized by different properties and 
      features. These can be categorized both from a quantitative and qualitative 
      standpoint, and include data generated from wet-lab and microarrays (molecular 
      big data), databases and registries (clinical/computational big data), imaging 
      techniques (such as radiomics, imaging big data) and web searches (the so-called 
      infodemiology, digital big data). The present review aims to show how big and 
      smart data can revolutionize gynecology by shedding light on female reproductive 
      health, both in terms of physiology and pathophysiology. More specifically, they 
      appear to have potential uses in the field of gynecology to increase its accuracy 
      and precision, stratify patients, provide opportunities for personalized 
      treatment options rather than delivering a package of "one-size-fits-it-all" 
      healthcare management provisions, and enhance its effectiveness at each stage 
      (health promotion, prevention, diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutics).

TI  - Using Smart Home Technologies to Promote Physical Activity Among the General and 
      Aging Populations: Scoping Review.
PG  - e41942

AB  - BACKGROUND: Health-monitoring smart homes are becoming popular, with experts 
      arguing that 9-to-5 health care services might soon become a thing of the past. 
      However, no review has explored the landscape of smart home technologies that aim 
      to promote physical activity and independent living among a wide range of age 
      groups. OBJECTIVE: This review aims to map published studies on smart home 
      technologies aimed at promoting physical activity among the general and aging 
      populations to unveil the state of the art, its potential, and the research gaps 
      and opportunities. METHODS: Articles were retrieved from 6 databases (PubMed, 
      CINAHL, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, ACM Library, and Web of Science). The criteria for 
      inclusion were that the articles must be user studies that dealt with smart home 
      or Active Assisted Living technologies and physical activity, were written in 
      English, and were published in peer-reviewed journals. In total, 3 researchers 
      independently and collaboratively assessed the eligibility of the retrieved 
      articles and elicited the relevant data and findings using tables and charts. 
      RESULTS: This review synthesized 20 articles that met the inclusion criteria, 70% 
      (14/20) of which were conducted between 2018 and 2020. Three-quarters of the 
      studies (15/20, 75%) were conducted in Western countries, with the United States 
      accounting for 25% (5/20). Activities of daily living were the most studied 
      (9/20, 45%), followed by physical activity (6/20, 30%), therapeutic exercise 
      (4/20, 20%), and bodyweight exercise (1/20, 5%). K-nearest neighbor and naïve 
      Bayes classifier were the most used machine learning algorithms for activity 
      recognition, with at least 10% (2/20) of the studies using either algorithm. 
      Ambient and wearable technologies were equally studied (8/20, 40% each), followed 
      by robots (3/20, 15%). Activity recognition was the most common goal of the 
      evaluated smart home technologies, with 55% (11/20) of the studies reporting it, 
      followed by activity monitoring (7/20, 35%). Most studies (8/20, 40%) were 
      conducted in a laboratory setting. Moreover, 25% (5/20) and 10% (2/20) were 
      conducted in a home and hospital setting, respectively. Finally, 75% (15/20) had 
      a positive outcome, 15% (3/20) had a mixed outcome, and 10% (2/20) had an 
      indeterminate outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that smart home 
      technologies, especially digital personal assistants, coaches, and robots, are 
      effective in promoting physical activity among the young population. Although 
      only few studies were identified among the older population, smart home 
      technologies hold bright prospects in assisting and aiding older people to age in 
      place and function independently, especially in Western countries, where there 
      are shortages of long-term care workers. Hence, there is a need to do more work 
      (eg, cross-cultural studies and randomized controlled trials) among the growing 
      aging population on the effectiveness and acceptance of smart home technologies 
      that aim to promote physical activity.

      Europace perspective.
LID - 10.1093/europace/euad176 [doi]
LID - euad176
AB  - AIMS: Over the past 25 years there has been a substantial development in the 
      field of digital electrophysiology (EP) and in parallel a substantial increase in 
      publications on digital cardiology.In this celebratory paper, we provide an 
      overview of the digital field by highlighting publications from the field 
      focusing on the EP Europace journal. RESULTS: In this journey across the past 
      quarter of a century we follow the development of digital tools commonly used in 
      the clinic spanning from the initiation of digital clinics through the early days 
      of telemonitoring, to wearables, mobile applications, and the use of fully 
      virtual clinics. We then provide a chronicle of the field of artificial 
      intelligence, a regulatory perspective, and at the end of our journey provide a 
      future outlook for digital EP. CONCLUSION: Over the past 25 years Europace has 
      published a substantial number of papers on digital EP, with a marked expansion 
      in digital publications in recent years.

AB  - In the past decade, the global industry and research attentions on intelligent 
      skin-like electronics have boosted their applications in diverse fields including 
      human healthcare, Internet of Things, human-machine interfaces, artificial 
      intelligence and soft robotics. Among them, flexible humidity sensors play a 
      vital role in noncontact measurements relying on the unique property of rapid 
      response to humidity change. This work presents an overview of recent advances in 
      flexible humidity sensors using various active functional materials for 
      contactless monitoring. Four categories of humidity sensors are highlighted based 
      on resistive, capacitive, impedance-type and voltage-type working mechanisms. 
      Furthermore, typical strategies including chemical doping, structural design and 
      Joule heating are introduced to enhance the performance of humidity sensors. 
      Drawing on the noncontact perception capability, human/plant healthcare 
      management, human-machine interactions as well as integrated humidity 
      sensor-based feedback systems are presented. The burgeoning innovations in this 
      research field will benefit human society, especially during the COVID-19 
      epidemic, where cross-infection should be averted and contactless sensation is 
      highly desired.

AB  - Using physiological data from wearable devices, the study aimed to predict 
      exercise exertion levels by building deep learning classification and regression 
      models. Physiological data were obtained using an unobtrusive chest-worn ECG 
      sensor and portable pulse oximeter from healthy individuals who performed 
      16-minute cycling exercise sessions. During each session, real-time ECG, pulse 
      rate, oxygen saturation, and revolutions per minute (RPM) data were collected at 
      three intensity levels. Subjects' ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) were 
      collected once per minute. Each 16-minute exercise session was divided into eight 
      2-minute windows. The self-reported RPEs, heart rate, RPMs, and oxygen saturation 
      levels were averaged for each window to form the predictive features. In 
      addition, heart rate variability (HRV) features were extracted from the ECG for 
      each window. Different feature selection algorithms were used to choose 
      top-ranked predictors. The best predictors were then used to train and test deep 
      learning models for regression and classification analysis. Our results showed 
      the highest accuracy and F1 score of 98.2% and 98%, respectively in training the 
      models. For testing the models, the highest accuracy and F1 score were 80%.

AB  - Tele-rehabilitation is a healthcare practice that leverages technology to provide 
      rehabilitation services remotely to individuals in their own homes or other 
      locations. With advancements in remote monitoring and Artificial Intelligence, 
      automatic tele-rehabilitation systems that can measure joint angles, recognize 
      exercises, and provide feedback based on movement analysis are being developed. 
      Such platforms can offer valuable information to clinicians for improved care 
      planning. However, with various methods and sensors being used, understanding 
      their pros, cons, and performance is important. This paper reviews and compares 
      the performance of recent vision-based, wearable, and pressure-sensing 
      technologies used in lower limb tele-rehabilitation systems over the past 
      10 years (from 2014 to 2023). We selected studies that were published in English 
      and focused on joint angle estimation, activity recognition, and exercise 
      assessment. Vision-based approaches were the most common, accounting for 42% of 
      studies. Wearable technology followed at approximately 37%, and pressure-sensing 
      technology appeared in 21% of studies. Identified gaps include a lack of 
      uniformity in reported performance metrics and evaluation methods, a need for 
      cross-subject validation, inadequate testing with patients and older adults, 
      restricted sets of exercises evaluated, and a scarcity of comprehensive datasets 
      on lower limb exercises, especially those involving movements while lying down.

TI  - Effectiveness of artificial intelligent cardiac remote monitoring system for 
      evaluating asymptomatic myocardial ischemia in patients with coronary heart 
      disease.
PG  - 11653-11661
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the effectiveness of cardiac remote monitoring system 
      (CRMS) based on artificial intelligence-enabled ECG algorithm mode for evaluating 
      asymptomatic myocardial ischemia (AMI) in patients with coronary artery disease 
      (CAD). METHODS: Two hundred CAD patients confirmed by coronary angiography (CA) 
      in our hospital were included as the study subjects, 120 of whom developed 
      myocardial ischemia (MI). All patients received 12-lead telephone remote ECG 
      monitoring and evaluation. After monitoring, artificial intelligence-enabled ECG 
      algorithm was performed to observe the detection rate of MI. RESULTS: Compared 
      with artificial intelligence-enabled ECG algorithm combined with remote ECG 
      monitoring system, the detection rate of remote ECG monitoring system in 120 MI 
      patients was lower (96.67% vs. 86.67%, P<0.01). Among the 120 MI patients, there 
      were 26 patients (21.67%) with symptomatic myocardial ischemia (SMI) and 94 
      patients (78.33%) with AMI. There was no difference between the two detection 
      methods in the diagnosis of SMI (P>0.05), while there was a difference in the 
      diagnosis of AMI (P<0.01). The degree and duration of ST segment decline and the 
      threshold variability of MI were higher in SMI patients than those in AMI 
      patients (P<0.001). It showed that the lowest frequency of MI was from 0:00 to 
      06:00, and the highest from 06:01 to 12:00, with significant difference compared 
      with other time periods (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The CRMS based on artificial 
      intelligence-enabled ECG algorithm mode can significantly improve the detection 
      rate of AMI. Moreover, small changes of ST segment in AMI patients and circadian 
      rhythm of disease onset were presented.

TI  - A Novel IoT-Enabled Healthcare Monitoring Framework and Improved Grey Wolf 
      Optimization Algorithm-Based Deep Convolution Neural Network Model for Early 
      Diagnosis of Lung Cancer.

AB  - Lung cancer is a high-risk disease that causes mortality worldwide; nevertheless, 
      lung nodules are the main manifestation that can help to diagnose lung cancer at 
      an early stage, lowering the workload of radiologists and boosting the rate of 
      diagnosis. Artificial intelligence-based neural networks are promising 
      technologies for automatically detecting lung nodules employing patient 
      monitoring data acquired from sensor technology through an Internet-of-Things 
      (IoT)-based patient monitoring system. However, the standard neural networks rely 
      on manually acquired features, which reduces the effectiveness of detection. In 
      this paper, we provide a novel IoT-enabled healthcare monitoring platform and an 
      improved grey-wolf optimization (IGWO)-based deep convulution neural network 
      (DCNN) model for lung cancer detection. The Tasmanian Devil Optimization (TDO) 
      algorithm is utilized to select the most pertinent features for diagnosing lung 
      nodules, and the convergence rate of the standard grey wolf optimization (GWO) 
      algorithm is modified, resulting in an improved GWO algorithm. Consequently, an 
      IGWO-based DCNN is trained on the optimal features obtained from the IoT 
      platform, and the findings are saved in the cloud for the doctor's judgment. The 
      model is built on an Android platform with DCNN-enabled Python libraries, and the 
      findings are evaluated against cutting-edge lung cancer detection models.

TI  - A Lightweight Secure Adaptive Approach for Internet-of-Medical-Things Healthcare 
      Applications in Edge-Cloud-Based Networks.
LID - 10.3390/s22062379 [doi]
LID - 2379
AB  - Mobile-cloud-based healthcare applications are increasingly growing in practice. 
      For instance, healthcare, transport, and shopping applications are designed on 
      the basis of the mobile cloud. For executing mobile-cloud applications, 
      offloading and scheduling are fundamental mechanisms. However, mobile healthcare 
      workflow applications with these methods are widely ignored, demanding 
      applications in various aspects for healthcare monitoring, live healthcare 
      service, and biomedical firms. However, these offloading and scheduling schemes 
      do not consider the workflow applications' execution in their models. This paper 
      develops a lightweight secure efficient offloading scheduling (LSEOS) 
      metaheuristic model. LSEOS consists of light weight, and secure offloading and 
      scheduling methods whose execution offloading delay is less than that of existing 
      methods. The objective of LSEOS is to run workflow applications on other nodes 
      and minimize the delay and security risk in the system. The metaheuristic LSEOS 
      consists of the following components: adaptive deadlines, sorting, and scheduling 
      with neighborhood search schemes. Compared to current strategies for delay and 
      security validation in a model, computational results revealed that the LSEOS 
      outperformed all available offloading and scheduling methods for process 
      applications by 10% security ratio and by 29% regarding delays.

TI  - Incorporating patient concerns into design requirements for IoMT-based systems: 
      The fall detection case study.
PG  - 1460458220982640
LID - 10.1177/1460458220982640 [doi]
AB  - Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) systems are envisioned to provide high-quality 
      healthcare services to patients in the comfort of their home, utilizing 
      cutting-edge Internet of Things (IoT) technologies and medical sensors. Patient 
      comfort and willingness to participate in such efforts is a prominent factor for 
      their adoption. As IoT technology has provided solutions for all technical 
      issues, patient concerns are those that seem to restrict their wider adoption. To 
      enhance patient awareness of the system properties and enhance their willingness 
      to adopt IoMT solutions, this paper presents a novel methodology to integrate 
      patient concerns in the design requirements of such systems. It comprises a 
      number of straightforward steps that an IoMT designer can follow, starting from 
      identifying patient concerns, incorporating them in system design requirements as 
      criticalities, proceeding to system implementation and testing, and finally, 
      verifying that it fulfills the concerns of the patients. To showcase the 
      effectiveness of the proposed methodology, the paper applies it in the design and 
      implementation of a fall detection system for elderly patients remotely monitored 
      in their homes.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) technologies have been applied to various fields such as 
      manufacturing, automobile industry and healthcare. IoT-based healthcare has a 
      significant impact on real-time remote monitoring of patients' health and 
      consequently improving treatments and reducing healthcare costs. In fact, IoT has 
      made healthcare more reliable, efficient, and accessible. Two major drawbacks 
      which IoT suffers from can be expressed as: first, thelimited battery capacityof 
      thesensorsis quickly depleted due to the continuous stream of data; second, the 
      dependence of the system on the cloud for computations and processing causes 
      latency in data transmission which is not accepted in real-time monitoring 
      applications. This research is conducted to develop a real-time, secure, and 
      energy-efficient platform which provides a solution for reducing computation load 
      on the cloud and diminishing data transmission delay. In the proposed platform, 
      the sensors utilize a state-of-the-art power saving technique known as 
      Compressive Sensing (CS). CS allows sensors to retrieve the sensed data using 
      fewer measurements by sending a compressed signal. In this framework, the signal 
      reconstruction and processing are computed locally on a Heterogeneous Multicore 
      Platform (HMP) device to decrease the dependency on the cloud. In addition, a 
      framework has been implemented to control the system, set different parameters, 
      display the data as well as send live notifications to medical experts through 
      the cloud in order to alert them of any eventual hazardous event or abnormality 
      and allow quick interventions. Finally, a case study of the system is presented 
      demonstrating the acquisition and monitoring of the data for a given subject in 
      real-time. The obtained results reveal that the proposed solution reduces 15.4% 
      of energy consumption in sensors, that makes this prototype a good candidate for 
      IoT employment in healthcare.

TI  - Personalized Analytics and a Wearable Biosensor Platform for Early Detection of 
      COVID-19 Decompensation (DeCODe): Protocol for the Development of the COVID-19 
      Decompensation Index.

AB  - BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, novel digital health technologies have 
      the potential to improve our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, improve 
      care delivery, and produce better health outcomes. The National Institutes of 
      Health called on digital health leaders to contribute to a high-quality data 
      repository that will support researchers to make discoveries that are otherwise 
      not possible with small, limited data sets. OBJECTIVE: To this end, we seek to 
      develop a COVID-19 digital biomarker for early detection of physiological 
      exacerbation or decompensation. We propose the development and validation of a 
      COVID-19 decompensation Index (CDI) in a 2-phase study that builds on existing 
      wearable biosensor-derived analytics generated by physIQ's end-to-end cloud 
      platform for continuous physiological monitoring with wearable biosensors. This 
      effort serves to achieve two primary objectives: (1) to collect adequate data to 
      help develop the CDI and (2) to collect rich deidentified clinical data 
      correlating with outcomes and symptoms related to COVID-19 progression. Our 
      secondary objectives include evaluation of the feasibility and usability of 
      pinpointIQ, a digital platform through which data are gathered, analyzed, and 
      displayed. METHODS: This is a prospective, nonrandomized, open-label, 2-phase 
      study. Phase I will involve data collection for the digital data hub of the 
      National Institutes of Health as well as data to support the preliminary 
      development of the CDI. Phase II will involve data collection for the hub and 
      contribute to continued refinement and validation of the CDI. While this study 
      will focus on the development of a CDI, the digital platform will also be 
      evaluated for feasibility and usability while clinicians deliver care to 
      continuously monitored patients enrolled in the study. RESULTS: Our target CDI 
      will be a binary classifier trained to distinguish participants with and those 
      without decompensation. The primary performance metric for CDI will be the area 
      under the receiver operating characteristic curve with a minimum performance 
      criterion of ≥0.75 (α=.05; power [1-β]=0.80). Furthermore, we will determine the 
      sex or gender and race or ethnicity of the participants, which would account for 
      differences in the CDI performance, as well as the lead time-time to predict 
      decompensation-and its relationship with the ultimate disease severity based on 
      the World Health Organization COVID-19 ordinal scale. CONCLUSIONS: Using machine 
      learning techniques on a large data set of patients with COVID-19 could provide 
      valuable insights into the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and a digital biomarker 
      for COVID-19 decompensation. Through this study, we intend to develop a tool that 
      can uniquely reflect physiological data of a diverse population and contribute to 
      high-quality data that will help researchers better understand COVID-19. TRIAL

TI  - A Wearable Electrocardiogram Telemonitoring System for Atrial Fibrillation 
      Detection.
LID - 10.3390/s20030606 [doi]

AB  - In this paper we proposed a wearable electrocardiogram (ECG) telemonitoring 
      system for atrial fibrillation (AF) detection based on a smartphone and cloud 
      computing. A wearable ECG patch was designed to collect ECG signals and send the 
      signals to an Android smartphone via Bluetooth. An Android APP was developed to 
      display the ECG waveforms in real time and transmit every 30 s ECG data to a 
      remote cloud server. A machine learning (CatBoost)-based ECG classification 
      method was proposed to detect AF in the cloud server. In case of detected AF, the 
      cloud server pushed the ECG data and classification results to the web browser of 
      a doctor. Finally, the Android APP displayed the doctor's diagnosis for the ECG 
      signals. Experimental results showed the proposed CatBoost classifier trained 
      with 17 selected features achieved an overall F(1) score of 0.92 on the test set 
      (n = 7,270). The proposed wearable ECG monitoring system may potentially be 
      useful for long-term ECG telemonitoring for AF detection.

LID - 10.1021/acsami.0c21372 [doi]
AB  - Wearable electronic textiles are used in sensors, energy-harvesting devices, 
      healthcare monitoring, human-machine interfaces, and soft robotics to acquire 
      real-time big data for machine learning and artificial intelligence. Wearability 
      is essential while collecting data from a human, who should be able to wear the 
      device with sufficient comfort. In this study, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and 
      silver nanowires (AgNWs) were supersonically sprayed onto a fabric to ensure good 
      adhesiveness, resulting in a washable, stretchable, and wearable fabric without 
      affecting the performance of the designed features. This rGO/AgNW-decorated 
      fabric can be used to monitor external stimuli such as strain and temperature. In 
      addition, it is used as a heater and as a supercapacitor and features an 
      antibacterial hydrophobic surface that minimizes potential infection from 
      external airborne viruses or virus-containing droplets. Herein, the wearability, 
      stretchability, washability, mechanical durability, temperature-sensing 
      capability, heating ability, wettability, and antibacterial features of this 
      metallized fabric are explored. This multifunctionality is achieved in a single 
      fabric coated with rGO/AgNWs via supersonic spraying.

      The GATEKEEPER (GK) Project was financed to create a vendor independent platform 
      to be adopted in medical practice and to demonstrate its effect, benefit value, 
      and scalability in 8 connected medical use cases with some independent pilots. 
      This paper, after a description of the GK platform architecture, is focused on 
      the creation of a FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource) IG 
      (Implementation Guide) and its adoption in specific use cases. The final aim is 
      to combine conventional data, collected in the hospital, with unconventional 
      data, coming from wearable devices, to exploit artificial intelligence (AI) 
      models designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a new parsimonious risk 
      prediction model for Type 2 diabetes (T2D).

TI  - A Machine Learning Approach for Walking Classification in Elderly People with 
      Gait Disorders.
LID - 10.3390/s23020679 [doi]
LID - 679
AB  - Walking ability of elderly individuals, who suffer from walking difficulties, is 
      limited, which restricts their mobility independence. The physical health and 
      well-being of the elderly population are affected by their level of physical 
      activity. Therefore, monitoring daily activities can help improve the quality of 
      life. This becomes especially a huge challenge for those, who suffer from 
      dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Thus, it is of great importance for personnel 
      in care homes/rehabilitation centers to monitor their daily activities and 
      progress. Unlike normal subjects, it is required to place the sensor on the back 
      of this group of patients, which makes it even more challenging to detect walking 
      from other activities. With the latest advancements in the field of health 
      sensing and sensor technology, a huge amount of accelerometer data can be easily 
      collected. In this study, a Machine Learning (ML) based algorithm was developed 
      to analyze the accelerometer data collected from patients with walking 
      difficulties, who live in one of the municipalities in Denmark. The ML algorithm 
      is capable of accurately classifying the walking activity of these individuals 
      with different walking abnormalities. Various statistical, temporal, and spectral 
      features were extracted from the time series data collected using an 
      accelerometer sensor placed on the back of the participants. The back sensor 
      placement is desirable in patients with dementia and Alzheimer's disease since 
      they may remove visible sensors to them due to the nature of their diseases. 
      Then, an evolutionary optimization algorithm called Particle Swarm Optimization 
      (PSO) was used to select a subset of features to be used in the classification 
      step. Four different ML classifiers such as k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Random 
      Forest (RF), Stacking Classifier (Stack), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) 
      were trained and compared on an accelerometry dataset consisting of 20 
      participants. These models were evaluated using the leave-one-group-out 
      cross-validation (LOGO-CV) technique. The Stack model achieved the best 
      performance with average sensitivity, positive predictive values (precision), 
      F(1)-score, and accuracy of 86.85%, 93.25%, 88.81%, and 93.32%, respectively, to 
      classify walking episodes. In general, the empirical results confirmed that the 
      proposed models are capable of classifying the walking episodes despite the 
      challenging sensor placement on the back of the patients, who suffer from walking 
      disabilities.

TI  - Home Monitoring of Asthma Exacerbations in Children and Adults With Use of an 
      AI-Aided Stethoscope.
PG  - 517-525
LID - 10.1370/afm.3039 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The advent of new medical devices allows patients with asthma to 
      self-monitor at home, providing a more complete picture of their disease than 
      occasional in-person clinic visits. This raises a pertinent question: which 
      devices and parameters perform best in exacerbation detection? METHODS: A total 
      of 149 patients with asthma (90 children, 59 adults) participated in a 6-month 
      observational study. Participants (or parents) regularly (daily for the first 2 
      weeks and weekly for the next 5.5 months, with increased frequency during 
      exacerbations) performed self-examinations using 3 devices: an artificial 
      intelligence (AI)-aided home stethoscope (providing wheezes, rhonchi, and coarse 
      and fine crackles intensity; respiratory and heart rate; and 
      inspiration-to-expiration ratio), a peripheral capillary oxygen saturation 
      (SpO(2)) meter, and a peak expiratory flow (PEF) meter and filled out a health 
      state survey. The resulting 6,029 examinations were evaluated by physicians for 
      the presence of exacerbations. For each registered parameter, a machine learning 
      model was trained, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
      (AUC) was calculated to assess its utility in exacerbation detection. RESULTS: 
      The best single-parameter discriminators of exacerbations were wheezes intensity 
      for young children (AUC 84% [95% CI, 82%-85%]), rhonchi intensity for older 
      children (AUC 81% [95% CI, 79%-84%]), and survey answers for adults (AUC 92% [95% 
      CI, 89%-95%]). The greatest efficacy (in terms of AUC) was observed for a 
      combination of several parameters. CONCLUSIONS: The AI-aided home stethoscope 
      provides reliable information on asthma exacerbations. The parameters provided 
      are effective for children, especially those younger than 5 years of age. The 
      introduction of this tool to the health care system might enhance asthma 
      exacerbation detection substantially and make remote monitoring of patients 
      easier.

TI  - How Will Artificial Intelligence Shape the Future of Decision-Making in 
      Congenital Heart Disease?
LID - 10.3390/jcm13102996 [doi]
LID - 2996
AB  - Improvements in medical technology have significantly changed the management of 
      congenital heart disease (CHD), offering novel tools to predict outcomes and 
      personalize follow-up care. By using sophisticated imaging modalities, 
      computational models and machine learning algorithms, clinicians can experiment 
      with unprecedented insights into the complex anatomy and physiology of CHD. These 
      tools enable early identification of high-risk patients, thus allowing timely, 
      tailored interventions and improved outcomes. Additionally, the integration of 
      genetic testing offers valuable prognostic information, helping in risk 
      stratification and treatment optimisation. The birth of telemedicine platforms 
      and remote monitoring devices facilitates customised follow-up care, enhancing 
      patient engagement and reducing healthcare disparities. Taking into consideration 
      challenges and ethical issues, clinicians can make the most of the full potential 
      of artificial intelligence (AI) to further refine prognostic models, personalize 
      care and improve long-term outcomes for patients with CHD. This narrative review 
      aims to provide a comprehensive illustration of how AI has been implemented as a 
      new technological method for enhancing the management of CHD.

TI  - A Novel Sparse Linear Mixed Model for Multi-Source Mixed-Frequency Data Fusion in 
      Telemedicine.
PG  - 215-225
LID - 10.1080/24725579.2023.2202877 [doi]
AB  - Digital health and telemonitoring have resulted in a wealth of information to be 
      collected to monitor, manage, and improve human health. The multi-source 
      mixed-frequency health data overwhelm the modeling capacity of existing 
      statistical and machine learning models, due to many challenging properties. 
      Although predictive analytics for big health data plays an important role in 
      telemonitoring, there is a lack of rigorous prediction model that can 
      automatically predicts patients' health conditions, e.g., Disease Severity 
      Indicators (DSIs), from multi-source mixed-frequency data. Sleep disorder is a 
      prevalent cardiac syndrome that is characterized by abnormal respiratory patterns 
      during sleep. Although wearable devices are available to administrate sleep 
      studies at home, the manual scoring process to generate the DSI remains a 
      bottleneck in automated monitoring and diagnosis of sleep disorder. To address 
      the multi-fold challenges for precise prediction of the DSI from high-dimensional 
      multi-source mixed-frequency data in sleep disorder, we propose a sparse linear 
      mixed model that combines the modified Cholesky decomposition with group lasso 
      penalties to enable joint group selection of fixed effects and random effects. A 
      novel Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm integrated with an efficient 
      Majorization Maximization (MM) algorithm is developed for model estimation of the 
      proposed sparse linear mixed model with group variable selection. The proposed 
      method was applied to the SHHS data for telemonitoring and diagnosis of sleep 
      disorder and found that a few significant feature groups that are consistent with 
      prior medical studies on sleep disorder. The proposed method also outperformed a 
      few benchmark methods with the highest prediction accuracy.

TI  - Automated remote sleep monitoring needs uncertainty quantification.

AB  - Wearable electroencephalography devices emerge as a cost-effective and ergonomic 
      alternative to gold-standard polysomnography, paving the way for better health 
      monitoring and sleep disorder screening. Machine learning allows to automate 
      sleep stage classification, but trust and reliability issues have hampered its 
      adoption in clinical applications. Estimating uncertainty is a crucial factor in 
      enhancing reliability by identifying regions of heightened and diminished 
      confidence. In this study, we used an uncertainty-centred machine learning 
      pipeline, U-PASS, to automate sleep staging in a challenging real-world dataset 
      of single-channel electroencephalography and accelerometry collected with a 
      wearable device from an elderly population. We were able to effectively limit the 
      uncertainty of our machine learning model and to reliably inform clinical experts 
      of which predictions were uncertain to improve the machine learning model's 
      reliability. This increased the five-stage sleep-scoring accuracy of a 
      state-of-the-art machine learning model from 63.9% to 71.2% on our dataset. 
      Remarkably, the machine learning approach outperformed the human expert in 
      interpreting these wearable data. Manual review by sleep specialists, without 
      specific training for sleep staging on wearable electroencephalography, proved 
      ineffective. The clinical utility of this automated remote monitoring system was 
      also demonstrated, establishing a strong correlation between the predicted sleep 
      parameters and the reference polysomnography parameters, and reproducing known 
      correlations with the apnea-hypopnea index. In essence, this work presents a 
      promising avenue to revolutionize remote patient care through the power of 
      machine learning by the use of an automated data-processing pipeline enhanced 
      with uncertainty estimation.

TI  - Smart Home Sensing and Monitoring in Households With Dementia: User-Centered 
      Design Approach.
PG  - e27047
LID - 10.2196/27047 [doi]
LID - e27047
AB  - BACKGROUND: As life expectancy grows, so do the challenges of caring for an aging 
      population. Older adults, including people with dementia, want to live 
      independently and feel in control of their lives for as long as possible. 
      Assistive technologies powered by artificial intelligence and internet of things 
      devices are being proposed to provide living environments that support the users' 
      safety, psychological, and medical needs through remote monitoring and 
      interventions. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the functional, psychosocial, 
      and environmental needs of people living with dementia, their caregivers, 
      clinicians, and health and social care service providers toward the design and 
      implementation of smart home systems. METHODS: We used an iterative user-centered 
      design approach comprising 9 substudies. First, semistructured interviews (9 
      people with dementia, 9 caregivers, and 10 academic and clinical staff) and 
      workshops (35 pairs of people with dementia and caregivers, and 12 health and 
      social care clinicians) were conducted to define the needs of people with 
      dementia, home caregivers, and professional stakeholders in both daily activities 
      and technology-specific interactions. Then, the spectrum of needs identified was 
      represented via patient-caregiver personas and discussed with stakeholders in a 
      workshop (14 occupational therapists; 4 National Health Service pathway 
      directors; and 6 researchers in occupational therapy, neuropsychiatry, and 
      engineering) and 2 focus groups with managers of health care services (n=8), 
      eliciting opportunities for innovative care technologies and public health 
      strategies. Finally, these design opportunities were discussed in semistructured 
      interviews with participants of a smart home trial involving environmental 
      sensors, physiological measurement devices, smartwatches, and tablet-based 
      chatbots and cognitive assessment puzzles (10 caregivers and 2 people with 
      dementia). A thematic analysis revealed factors that motivate household members 
      to use these technologies. RESULTS: Outcomes of these activities include a 
      qualitative and quantitative analysis of patient, caregiver, and clinician needs 
      and the identification of challenges and opportunities for the design and 
      implementation of remote monitoring systems in public health pathways. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Participatory design methods supported the triangulation of 
      stakeholder perspectives to aid the development of more patient-centered 
      interventions and their translation to clinical practice and public health 
      strategy. We discuss the implications and limitations of our findings, the value 
      and the applicability of our methodology, and directions for future research.

AB  - This comprehensive review investigates the transformative potential of 
      sensor-driven digital twin technology in enhancing healthcare delivery within 
      smart environments. We explore the integration of smart environments with sensor 
      technologies, digital health capabilities, and location-based services, focusing 
      on their impacts on healthcare objectives and outcomes. This work analyzes the 
      foundational technologies, encompassing the Internet of Things (IoT), Internet of 
      Medical Things (IoMT), machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI), 
      that underpin the functionalities within smart environments. We also examine the 
      unique characteristics of smart homes and smart hospitals, highlighting their 
      potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery through remote patient monitoring, 
      telemedicine, and real-time data sharing. The review presents a novel solution 
      framework leveraging sensor-driven digital twins to address both healthcare needs 
      and user requirements. This framework incorporates wearable health devices, 
      AI-driven health analytics, and a proof-of-concept digital twin application. 
      Furthermore, we explore the role of location-based services (LBS) in smart 
      environments, emphasizing their potential to enhance personalized healthcare 
      interventions and emergency response capabilities. By analyzing the technical 
      advancements in sensor technologies and digital twin applications, this review 
      contributes valuable insights to the evolving landscape of smart environments for 
      healthcare. We identify the opportunities and challenges associated with this 
      emerging field and highlight the need for further research to fully realize its 
      potential to improve healthcare delivery and patient well-being.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study used electrocardiogram data in conjunction with artificial 
      intelligence methods as a noninvasive tool for detecting peripartum 
      cardiomyopathy. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the efficacy of an 
      artificial intelligence-based heart failure detection model for peripartum 
      cardiomyopathy detection. STUDY DESIGN: We first built a deep-learning model for 
      heart failure detection using retrospective data at the University of Tennessee 
      Health Science Center. Cases were adult and nonpregnant female patients with a 
      heart failure diagnosis; controls were adult nonpregnant female patients without 
      heart failure. The model was then tested on an independent cohort of pregnant 
      women at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center with or without 
      peripartum cardiomyopathy. We also tested the model in an external cohort of 
      pregnant women at Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist. Key outcomes were assessed 
      using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. We also 
      repeated our analysis using only lead I electrocardiogram as an input to assess 
      the feasibility of remote monitoring via wearables that can capture single-lead 
      electrocardiogram data. RESULTS: The University of Tennessee Health Science 
      Center heart failure cohort comprised 346,339 electrocardiograms from 142,601 
      patients. In this cohort, 60% of participants were Black and 37% were White, with 
      an average age (standard deviation) of 53 (19) years. The heart failure detection 
      model achieved an area under the curve of 0.92 on the holdout set. We then tested 
      the ability of the heart failure model to detect peripartum cardiomyopathy in an 
      independent University of Tennessee Health Science Center cohort of pregnant 
      women and an external Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist cohort of pregnant women. 
      The independent University of Tennessee Health Science Center cohort included 158 
      electrocardiograms from 115 patients; our deep-learning model achieved an area 
      under the curve of 0.83 (0.77-0.89) for this data set. The external Atrium Health 
      Wake Forest Baptist cohort involved 80 electrocardiograms from 43 patients; our 
      deep-learning model achieved an area under the curve of 0.94 (0.91-0.98) for this 
      data set. For identifying peripartum cardiomyopathy diagnosed ≥10 days after 
      delivery, the model achieved an area under the curve of 0.88 (0.81-0.94) for the 
      University of Tennessee Health Science Center cohort and of 0.96 (0.93-0.99) for 
      the Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist cohort. When we repeated our analysis by 
      building a heart failure detection model using only lead-I electrocardiograms, we 
      obtained similarly high detection accuracies, with areas under the curve of 0.73 
      and 0.93 for the University of Tennessee Health Science Center and Atrium Health 
      Wake Forest Baptist cohorts, respectively. CONCLUSION: Artificial intelligence 
      can accurately detect peripartum cardiomyopathy from electrocardiograms alone. A 
      simple electrocardiographic artificial intelligence-based peripartum screening 
      could result in a timelier diagnosis. Given that results with 1-lead 
      electrocardiogram data were similar to those obtained using all 12 leads, future 
      studies will focus on remote screening for peripartum cardiomyopathy using 
      smartwatches that can capture single-lead electrocardiogram data.

TI  - Predicting cognitive scores from wearable-based digital physiological features 
      using machine learning: data from a clinical trial in mild cognitive impairment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Continuous assessment and remote monitoring of cognitive function in 
      individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) enables tracking therapeutic 
      effects and modifying treatment to achieve better clinical outcomes. While 
      standardized neuropsychological tests are inconvenient for this purpose, wearable 
      sensor technology collecting physiological and behavioral data looks promising to 
      provide proxy measures of cognitive function. The objective of this study was to 
      evaluate the predictive ability of digital physiological features, based on 
      sensor data from wrist-worn wearables, in determining neuropsychological test 
      scores in individuals with MCI. METHODS: We used the dataset collected from a 
      10-week single-arm clinical trial in older adults (50-70 years old) diagnosed 
      with amnestic MCI (N = 30) who received a digitally delivered multidomain 
      therapeutic intervention. Cognitive performance was assessed before and after the 
      intervention using the Neuropsychological Test Battery (NTB) from which composite 
      scores were calculated (executive function, processing speed, immediate memory, 
      delayed memory and global cognition). The Empatica E4, a wrist-wearable 
      medical-grade device, was used to collect physiological data including blood 
      volume pulse, electrodermal activity, and skin temperature. We processed sensors' 
      data and extracted a range of physiological features. We used interpolated NTB 
      scores for 10-day intervals to test predictability of scores over short periods 
      and to leverage the maximum of wearable data available. In addition, we used 
      individually centered data which represents deviations from personal baselines. 
      Supervised machine learning was used to train models predicting NTB scores from 
      digital physiological features and demographics. Performance was evaluated using 
      "leave-one-subject-out" and "leave-one-interval-out" cross-validation. RESULTS: 
      The final sample included 96 aggregated data intervals from 17 individuals. In 
      total, 106 digital physiological features were extracted. We found that 
      physiological features, especially measures of heart rate variability, correlated 
      most strongly to the executive function compared to other cognitive composites. 
      The model predicted the actual executive function scores with correlation 
      r = 0.69 and intra-individual changes in executive function scores with r = 0.61. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated that wearable-based physiological 
      measures, primarily HRV, have potential to be used for the continuous assessments 
      of cognitive function in individuals with MCI.

LID - e61312
AB  - Wearable technologies have emerged as powerful tools in healthcare, offering 
      continuous monitoring and personalized insights outside traditional clinical 
      settings. These devices have garnered significant attention in cardiovascular 
      medicine for their potential to transform patient care and improve outcomes. This 
      comprehensive review provides an overview of wearable technologies' evolution, 
      advancements, and applications in cardiovascular medicine. We examine the 
      miniaturization of sensors, integration of artificial intelligence (AI), and 
      proliferation of remote patient monitoring solutions. Key findings include the 
      role of wearables in the early detection of cardiovascular conditions, 
      personalized health tracking, and remote patient management. Challenges such as 
      data privacy concerns and regulatory hurdles are also addressed. The adoption of 
      wearable technologies holds promise for shifting healthcare from reactive to 
      proactive, enabling precision diagnostics, treatment optimization, and preventive 
      strategies. Collaboration among healthcare stakeholders is essential to 
      harnessing the full potential of wearables in cardiovascular medicine and 
      ushering in a new era of personalized, proactive healthcare.

TI  - Older Adults' and Clinicians' Perspectives on a Smart Health Platform for the 
      Aging Population: Design and Evaluation Study.
PG  - e29623
LID - 10.2196/29623 [doi]
LID - e29623
AB  - BACKGROUND: Over recent years, interest in the development of smart health 
      technologies aimed at supporting independent living for older populations has 
      increased. The integration of innovative technologies, such as the Internet of 
      Things, wearable technologies, artificial intelligence, and ambient-assisted 
      living applications, represents a valuable solution for this scope. Designing 
      such an integrated system requires addressing several aspects (eg, equipment 
      selection, data management, analytics, costs, and users' needs) and involving 
      different areas of expertise (eg, medical science, service design, biomedical and 
      computer engineering). OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is 2-fold; we aimed 
      to design the functionalities of a smart health platform addressing 5 chronic 
      conditions prevalent in the older population (ie, hearing loss, cardiovascular 
      diseases, cognitive impairments, mental health problems, and balance disorders) 
      by considering both older adults' and clinicians' perspectives and to evaluate 
      the identified smart health platform functionalities with a small group of older 
      adults. METHODS: Overall, 24 older adults (aged >65 years) and 118 clinicians 
      were interviewed through focus group activities and web-based questionnaires to 
      elicit the smart health platform requirements. Considering the elicited 
      requirements, the main functionalities of smart health platform were designed. 
      Then, a focus group involving 6 older adults was conducted to evaluate the 
      proposed solution in terms of usefulness, credibility, desirability, and 
      learnability. RESULTS: Eight main functionalities were identified and 
      assessed-cognitive training and hearing training (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; 
      credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 6/6, 100%; learnability: 6/6, 100%), 
      monitoring of physiological parameters (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; credibility: 6/6, 
      100%; desirability: 6/6, 100%; learnability: 5/6, 83%), physical training 
      (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 5/6, 83%; 
      learnability: 2/6, 33%), psychoeducational intervention (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; 
      credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 4/6, 67%; learnability: 2/6, 33%), mood 
      monitoring (usefulness: 4/6, 67%; credibility: 4/6, 67%; desirability: 3/6, 50%; 
      learnability: 5/6, 50%), diet plan (usefulness: 5/6, 83%; credibility: 4/6, 67%; 
      desirability: 1/6, 17%; learnability: 2/6, 33%), and environment monitoring and 
      adjustment (usefulness: 1/6, 17%; credibility: 1/6, 17%; desirability: 0/6, 0%; 
      learnability: 0/6, 0%). Most of them were highly appreciated by older 
      participants, with the only exception being environment monitoring and 
      adjustment. The results showed that the proposed functionalities met the needs 
      and expectations of users (eg, improved self-management of patients' disease and 
      enhanced patient safety). However, some aspects need to be addressed (eg, 
      technical and privacy issues). CONCLUSIONS: The presented smart health platform 
      functionalities seem to be able to meet older adults' needs and desires to 
      enhance their self-awareness and self-management of their medical condition, 
      encourage healthy and independent living, and provide evidence-based support for 
      clinicians' decision-making. Further research with a larger and more 
      heterogeneous pool of stakeholders in terms of demographics and clinical 
      conditions is needed to assess system acceptability and overall user experience 
      in free-living conditions.

TI  - A Flexible and Ultra-Highly Sensitive Tactile Sensor through a Parallel Circuit 
      by a Magnetic Aligned Conductive Composite.
PG  - 746-754
LID - 10.1021/acsnano.1c08273 [doi]
AB  - The development of flexible electronic skins with high performance and 
      multifunctional sensing capabilities is of great significance for applications 
      ranging from healthcare monitoring to artificial intelligence. To mimic and 
      surpass the high-gauge-factor sensing properties of human skin, structure design 
      and appropriate material selection of sensors are both essentially required. 
      Here, we present an efficient, low-cost fabrication strategy to construct an 
      ultra-highly sensitive, flexible pressure sensor by embedding the aligned 
      nickel-coated carbon fibers (NICFs) in a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate. 
      Our design substantially contributes to ultrahigh sensitivity through the 
      parallel circuit formed by aligned NICFs as well as surface spinosum 
      microstructure molded by sandpaper. As a result, the sensor exhibits excellent 
      sensitivity (15 525 kPa(-1)), a fast response time (30 ms), and good stability 
      over 3000 loading-unloading cycles. Furthermore, these superior sensing 
      properties trigger applications in water quality and wave monitoring in 
      conjunction with mechanical flexibility and robustness. As a precedent for 
      adjusting the sensitivities of the sensor, the NICFs/PDMS sensor provides a 
      promising method for multiscenario healthcare monitoring, multiscale pressure 
      spatial distribution, and human-machine interfacing.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease 
      affecting millions worldwide. Bespoke subject-specific treatment (medication or 
      deep brain stimulation (DBS)) is critical for management, yet depends on precise 
      assessment cardinal PD symptoms - bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor. Clinician 
      diagnosis is the basis of treatment, yet it allows only a cross-sectional 
      assessment of symptoms which can vary on an hourly basis and is liable to inter- 
      and intra-rater subjectivity across human examiners. Automated symptomatic 
      assessment has attracted significant interest to optimise treatment regimens 
      between clinician visits, however, no wearable has the capacity to simultaneously 
      assess all three cardinal symptoms. Challenges in the measurement of rigidity, 
      mapping muscle activity out-of-clinic and sensor fusion have inhibited 
      translation. In this study, we address all through a novel wearable sensor system 
      and machine learning algorithms. The sensor system is composed of a force-sensor, 
      three inertial measurement units (IMUs) and four custom mechanomyography (MMG) 
      sensors. The system was tested in its capacity to predict Unified Parkinson's 
      Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores based on quantitative assessment of 
      bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor in PD patients. 23 PD patients were tested with 
      the sensor system in parallel with exams conducted by treating clinicians and 10 
      healthy subjects were recruited as a comparison control group. Results prove the 
      system accurately predicts UPDRS scores for all symptoms (85.4% match on average 
      with physician assessment) and discriminates between healthy subjects and PD 
      patients (96.6% on average). MMG features can also be used for remote monitoring 
      of severity and fluctuations in PD symptoms out-of-clinic. This closed-loop 
      feedback system enables individually tailored and regularly updated treatment, 
      facilitating better outcomes for a very large patient population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nowadays, smart healthcare minimizes medical facilities costs, ease 
      staff burden, achieve unified control of materials and records, and enhance 
      patients' medical experience. Smart healthcare treatments have critical barriers 
      to improving patient outcomes, reducing the regulatory burden, and promoting the 
      transition from volume to benefit. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, the Internet of 
      Things-assisted Intelligent Monitoring Model (IoT-IMM) has been proposed to 
      improve patient health and maintain health records. METHOD: The advanced IoT 
      sensors can monitor patient health and insert into the patients' bodies. 
      Information collected can be analyzed, aggregated, and mined to predict diseases 
      at an early stage. For that, an enhanced deep learning network using Bayes 
      theorem (EDLN-BT) benefits to obtain and verify various patient health data in a 
      specific aspect, making it easy to supervise the patient's activities. RESULTS: 
      The IoT-IMM-based EDLN-BT results show the smart health care monitoring has 
      undergone substantial growth, improving patient satisfaction for the quality of 
      the healthcare services offered in hospitals and many other healthcare 
      facilities. It helps predict health diseases with increased accuracy, prediction 
      rate with minimal residual error delay, and energy consumption.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The ubiquity of mobile phones and increasing use of wearable fitness 
      trackers offer a wide-ranging window into people's health and well-being. There 
      are clear advantages in using remote monitoring technologies to gain an insight 
      into health, particularly under the shadow of the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: 
      Covid Collab is a crowdsourced study that was set up to investigate the 
      feasibility of identifying, monitoring, and understanding the stratification of 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection and recovery through remote monitoring technologies. 
      Additionally, we will assess the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated 
      social measures on people's behavior, physical health, and mental well-being. 
      METHODS: Participants will remotely enroll in the study through the Mass Science 
      app to donate historic and prospective mobile phone data, fitness tracking 
      wearable data, and regular COVID-19-related and mental health-related survey 
      data. The data collection period will cover a continuous period (ie, both before 
      and after any reported infections), so that comparisons to a participant's own 
      baseline can be made. We plan to carry out analyses in several areas, which will 
      cover symptomatology; risk factors; the machine learning-based classification of 
      illness; and trajectories of recovery, mental well-being, and activity. RESULTS: 
      As of June 2021, there are over 17,000 participants-largely from the United 
      Kingdom-and enrollment is ongoing. CONCLUSIONS: This paper introduces a 
      crowdsourced study that will include remotely enrolled participants to record 
      mobile health data throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The data collected may help 
      researchers investigate a variety of areas, including COVID-19 progression; 
      mental well-being during the pandemic; and the adherence of remote, digitally 
      enrolled participants. INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID):

AB  - Nano-scaled structures, wireless sensing, wearable devices, and wireless 
      communications systems are anticipated to support the development of new 
      next-generation technologies in the near future. Exponential rise in future 
      Radio-Frequency (RF) sensing systems have demonstrated its applications in areas 
      such as wearable consumer electronics, remote healthcare monitoring, wireless 
      implants, and smart buildings. In this paper, we propose a novel, non-wearable, 
      device-free, privacy-preserving Wi-Fi imaging-based occupancy detection system 
      for future smart buildings. The proposed system is developed using off-the-shelf 
      non-wearable devices such as Wi-Fi router, network interface card, and an 
      omnidirectional antenna for future body centric communication. The core idea is 
      to detect presence of person along its activities of daily living without 
      deploying a device on person's body. The Wi-Fi signals received using 
      non-wearable devices are converted into time-frequency scalograms. The occupancy 
      is detected by classifying the scalogram images using an auto-encoder neural 
      network. In addition to occupancy detection, the deep neural network also 
      identifies the activity performed by the occupant. Moreover, a novel encryption 
      algorithm using Chirikov and Intertwining map-based is also proposed to encrypt 
      the scalogram images. This feature enables secure storage of scalogram images in 
      a database for future analysis. The classification accuracy of the proposed 
      scheme is 91.1%.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is capable of controlling the healthcare monitoring 
      system for remote-based patients. Epilepsy, a chronic brain syndrome 
      characterized by recurrent, unpredictable attacks, affects individuals of all 
      ages. IoT-based seizure monitoring can greatly enhance seizure patients' quality 
      of life. IoT device acquires patient data and transmits it to a computer program 
      so that doctors can examine it. Currently, doctors invest significant manual 
      effort in inspecting Electroencephalograph (EEG) signals to identify seizure 
      activity. However, EEG-based seizure detection algorithms face challenges in 
      real-world scenarios due to non-stationary EEG data and variable seizure patterns 
      among patients and recording sessions. Therefore, a sophisticated computer-based 
      approach is necessary to analyze complex EEG records. In this work, the authors 
      proposed a hybrid approach by combining traditional convolution neural (CN) and 
      recurrent neural networks (RNN) along with an attention mechanism for the 
      automatic recognition of epileptic seizures through EEG signal analysis. This 
      attention mechanism focuses on significant subsets of EEG data for class 
      recognition, resulting in improved model performance. The proposed methods are 
      evaluated using a publicly available UCI epileptic seizure recognition dataset, 
      which consists of five classes: four normal conditions and one abnormal seizure 
      condition. Experimental results demonstrate that the suggested approach achieves 
      an overall accuracy of 97.05% for the five-class EEG recognition data, with an 
      accuracy of 99.52% for binary classification distinguishing seizure cases from 
      normal instances. Furthermore, the proposed intelligent seizure recognition model 
      is compatible with an IoMT (Internet of Medical Things) cloud-based smart 
      healthcare framework.

AB  - The Internet of things (IoT) has emerged as a topic of intense interest among the 
      research and industrial community as it has had a revolutionary impact on human 
      life. The rapid growth of IoT technology has revolutionized human life by 
      inaugurating the concept of smart devices, smart healthcare, smart industry, 
      smart city, smart grid, among others. IoT devices' security has become a serious 
      concern nowadays, especially for the healthcare domain, where recent attacks 
      exposed damaging IoT security vulnerabilities. Traditional network security 
      solutions are well established. However, due to the resource constraint property 
      of IoT devices and the distinct behavior of IoT protocols, the existing security 
      mechanisms cannot be deployed directly for securing the IoT devices and network 
      from the cyber-attacks. To enhance the level of security for IoT, researchers 
      need IoT-specific tools, methods, and datasets. To address the mentioned problem, 
      we provide a framework for developing IoT context-aware security solutions to 
      detect malicious traffic in IoT use cases. The proposed framework consists of a 
      newly created, open-source IoT data generator tool named IoT-Flock. The IoT-Flock 
      tool allows researchers to develop an IoT use-case comprised of both normal and 
      malicious IoT devices and generate traffic. Additionally, the proposed framework 
      provides an open-source utility for converting the captured traffic generated by 
      IoT-Flock into an IoT dataset. Using the proposed framework in this research, we 
      first generated an IoT healthcare dataset which comprises both normal and IoT 
      attack traffic. Afterwards, we applied different machine learning techniques to 
      the generated dataset to detect the cyber-attacks and protect the healthcare 
      system from cyber-attacks. The proposed framework will help in developing the 
      context-aware IoT security solutions, especially for a sensitive use case like 
      IoT healthcare environment.

TI  - An Elastic and Damage-Tolerant Dry Epidermal Patch with Robust Skin Adhesion for 
      Bioelectronic Interfacing.
PG  - 18608-18620
LID - 10.1021/acsnano.2c07097 [doi]
AB  - On-skin patches that record biopotential and biomechanical signals are essential 
      for wearable healthcare monitoring, clinical treatment, and human-machine 
      interaction. To acquire wearing comfort and high-quality signals, patches with 
      tissue-like softness, elastic recovery, damage tolerance, and robust 
      bioelectronic interface are highly desired yet challenging to achieve. Here, we 
      report a dry epidermal patch made from a supramolecular polymer (SESA) and an in 
      situ transferred carbon nanotubes' percolation network. The polymer possesses a 
      hybrid structure of copolymerized permanent scaffold permeated by multiple 
      dynamic interactions, which imparts a desired mechanical response transition from 
      elastic recoil to energy dissipation with increased elongation. Such SESA-based 
      patches are soft (Young's modulus ∼0.1 MPa) and elastic within physiologically 
      relevant strain levels (97% elastic recovery at 50% tensile strain), 
      intrinsically mechanical-electrical damage-resilient (∼90% restoration from 
      damage after 5 min), and interference-immune in dynamic signal acquisition 
      (stretch, underwater, sweat). We demonstrate its versatile physiological sensing 
      applications, including electrocardiogram recording under various disturbances, 
      machine-learning-enabled hand-gesture recognition through electromyogram 
      measurement, subtle radial artery pulse, and drastic knee kinematics sensing. 
      This epidermal patch offers a promising noninvasive, long-duration, and ambulant 
      bioelectronic interfacing with anti-interference robustness.

      Monitoring and Intelligent Information Encryption.
PG  - 6731-6738
LID - 10.1021/acsami.1c00402 [doi]
AB  - With the explosive development of smart wearable devices, a serious situation 
      that a large amount of energy waste and environmental pollution caused by 
      electronic discarding needs to be solved urgently. Here, as a throwaway waste 
      material, a chewed gum can be reused for the preparation of wearable iontronics 
      simply. A new gum sensor was constructed by regularly stretching a chewed gum in 
      6 M NaCl aqueous or even a Chinese edible salt solution for increasing the ionic 
      conductivity. This gum sensor can be shaped arbitrarily, and the preparation 
      process is green, pollution-free, with low energy consumption, and repeatable. 
      Herein, this gum sensor can be utilized for real-time human healthcare monitoring 
      effectively (i.e., facial mood changes, finger flexion, long time walking, and 
      continuous ankle movement) and shows a fast response time of 297 ms and a 
      reliable cycling performance in monitoring body motions. Furthermore, the gum 
      sensor (containing edible salt) can act as a signal transmitter for intelligent 
      information encryption and transmission in the light of the international Morse 
      code with excellent repeatability and stability. Hence, this work will greatly 
      possess wide potential application prospects in wearable electronics and 
      information encryption. This gum sensor also provides a ponderable option in the 
      next generation of artificial intelligence devices, which can address the 
      troubles of material selections in sensor preparation.

PG  - 1120-1122
LID - 10.1089/tmj.2020.0158 [doi]
AB  - In nearly 1 month, with a rapidly expanding corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), 
      telemedicine has been transformed into an essential service for delivering 
      routine clinical care. This transformation occurred as a crisis management 
      response-driven by the need to provide care for patients with physical distancing 
      measures in place. However, the current rapid adoption of telemedicine presents a 
      transitional state between one that existed before the pandemic and one that 
      could potentially be better aligned with the delivery of a personalized model of 
      care. Using the conceptual framework of digital translucence-situating virtual 
      encounters with more nuanced information regarding patients-we describe the role 
      of integrated remote monitoring and virtual care tools aligned with the patient's 
      electronic health record for adapting telemedicine delivery post-COVID-19.

      The MECHANO-STEMI Study.
LID - 10.3390/s22124384 [doi]
LID - 4384
AB  - Novel means to minimize treatment delays in patients with ST elevation myocardial 
      infarction (STEMI) are needed. Using an accelerometer and gyroscope on the chest 
      yield mechanocardiographic (MCG) data. We investigated whether STEMI causes 
      changes in MCG signals which could help to detect STEMI. The study group 
      consisted of 41 STEMI patients and 49 control patients referred for elective 
      coronary angiography and having normal left ventricular function and no valvular 
      heart disease or arrhythmia. MCG signals were recorded on the upper sternum in 
      supine position upon arrival to the catheterization laboratory. In this study, we 
      used a dedicated wearable sensor equipped with 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis 
      gyroscope and 1-lead ECG in order to facilitate the detection of STEMI in a 
      clinically meaningful way. A supervised machine learning approach was used. 
      Stability of beat morphology, signal strength, maximum amplitude and its timing 
      were calculated in six axes from each window with varying band-pass filters in 
      2-90 Hz range. In total, 613 features were investigated. Using logistic 
      regression classifier and leave-one-person-out cross validation we obtained a 
      sensitivity of 73.9%, specificity of 85.7% and AUC of 0.857 (SD = 0.005) using 
      150 best features. As a result, mechanical signals recorded on the upper chest 
      wall with the accelerometers and gyroscopes differ significantly between STEMI 
      patients and stable patients with normal left ventricular function. Future 
      research will show whether MCG can be used for the early screening of STEMI.

TI  - An Accelerometer-Based Wearable Patch for Robust Respiratory Rate and Wheeze 
      Detection Using Deep Learning.
LID - 10.3390/bios14030118 [doi]
LID - 118
AB  - Wheezing is a critical indicator of various respiratory conditions, including 
      asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Current diagnosis relies 
      on subjective lung auscultation by physicians. Enabling this capability via a 
      low-profile, objective wearable device for remote patient monitoring (RPM) could 
      offer pre-emptive, accurate respiratory data to patients. With this goal as our 
      aim, we used a low-profile accelerometer-based wearable system that utilizes deep 
      learning to objectively detect wheezing along with respiration rate using a 
      single sensor. The miniature patch consists of a sensitive wideband MEMS 
      accelerometer and low-noise CMOS interface electronics on a small board, which 
      was then placed on nine conventional lung auscultation sites on the patient's 
      chest walls to capture the pulmonary-induced vibrations (PIVs). A deep learning 
      model was developed and compared with a deterministic time-frequency method to 
      objectively detect wheezing in the PIV signals using data captured from 52 
      diverse patients with respiratory diseases. The wearable accelerometer patch, 
      paired with the deep learning model, demonstrated high fidelity in capturing and 
      detecting respiratory wheezes and patterns across diverse and pertinent settings. 
      It achieved accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 95%, 96%, and 93%, 
      respectively, with an AUC of 0.99 on the test set-outperforming the deterministic 
      time-frequency approach. Furthermore, the accelerometer patch outperforms the 
      digital stethoscopes in sound analysis while offering immunity to ambient sounds, 
      which not only enhances data quality and performance for computational wheeze 
      detection by a significant margin but also provides a robust sensor solution that 
      can quantify respiration patterns simultaneously.

TI  - Mobile Health Interventions: A Frontier for Mitigating the Global Burden of 
      Cardiovascular Disease.
PG  - e62157
LID - 10.7759/cureus.62157 [doi]
LID - e62157
AB  - Mobile health (mHealth) interventions have emerged as a promising approach for 
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention and management. The proliferation of 
      smartphones and wearable devices enables convenient access to health monitoring 
      tools, educational resources, and communication with healthcare providers. 
      mHealth interventions encompass mobile apps, wearables, and telehealth services 
      that empower users to monitor vital signs, adhere to medication, and adopt 
      healthier lifestyles. Their effectiveness hinges on user engagement, leveraging 
      behavioral science principles and gamification strategies. While mHealth offers 
      advantages such as personalized support and increased reach, it faces challenges 
      pertaining to data privacy, security concerns, and resistance from healthcare 
      providers. Robust encryption and adherence to regulations like the Health 
      Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) are crucial for safeguarding 
      sensitive health data. Integrating mHealth into clinical workflows can enhance 
      healthcare delivery, but organizational adjustments are necessary. The future of 
      mHealth is closely intertwined with artificial intelligence (AI), enabling remote 
      monitoring, predictive algorithms, and data-driven insights. Tech giants are 
      incorporating advanced health-tracking capabilities into their devices, paving 
      the way for personalized wellness approaches. However, mHealth grapples with 
      ethical dilemmas surrounding data ownership, privacy breaches, and inadvertent 
      data capture. Despite its potential, mHealth necessitates a concerted effort to 
      overcome obstacles and ensure ethical, secure, and practical implementation. 
      Addressing technical challenges, fostering standardization, and promoting 
      equitable access are pivotal for unlocking the transformative impact of mHealth 
      on cardiovascular health and reducing the global burden of CVD.

TI  - Rationale and design of the SafeHeart study: Development and testing of a mHealth 
      tool for the prediction of arrhythmic events and implantable 
      cardioverter-defibrillator therapy.
PG  - S11-S20
LID - 10.1016/j.cvdhj.2021.10.002 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) are at 
      a high risk of malignant ventricular arrhythmias. The use of remote ICD 
      monitoring, wearable devices, and patient-reported outcomes generate large 
      volumes of potential valuable data. Artificial intelligence-based methods can be 
      used to develop personalized prediction models and improve early-warning systems. 
      OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to develop an integrated web-based 
      personalized prediction engine for ICD therapy. METHODS: This international, 
      multicenter, prospective, observational study consists of 2 phases: (1) a 
      development study and (2) a feasibility study. We plan to enroll 400 participants 
      with an ICD (with or without cardiac resynchronization therapy) on remote 
      monitoring: 300 participants in the development study and 100 in the feasibility 
      study. During 12-month follow-up, electronic health record data, remote 
      monitoring data, accelerometry-assessed physical behavior data, and 
      patient-reported data are collected. By using machine- and deep-learning 
      approaches, a prediction engine is developed to assess the risk probability of 
      ICD therapy (shock and antitachycardia pacing). The feasibility of the prediction 
      engine as a clinical tool, the SafeHeart Platform, is assessed during the 
      feasibility study. RESULTS: Development study recruitment commenced in 2021. The 
      feasibility study starts in 2022. CONCLUSION: SafeHeart is the first study to 
      prospectively collect a multimodal data set to construct a personalized 
      prediction engine for ICD therapy. Moreover, SafeHeart explores the integration 
      and added value of detailed objective accelerometer data in the prediction of 
      clinical events. The translation of the SafeHeart Platform to clinical practice 
      is examined during the feasibility study.

TI  - Artificial intelligence mobile health platform for early detection of COVID-19 in 
      quarantine subjects using a wearable biosensor: protocol for a randomised 
      controlled trial.
PG  - e038555

AB  - INTRODUCTION: There is an outbreak of COVID-19 worldwide. As there is no 
      effective therapy or vaccine yet, rigorous implementation of traditional public 
      health measures such as isolation and quarantine remains the most effective tool 
      to control the outbreak. When an asymptomatic individual with COVID-19 exposure 
      is being quarantined, it is necessary to perform temperature and symptom 
      surveillance. As such surveillance is intermittent in nature and highly dependent 
      on self-discipline, it has limited effectiveness. Advances in biosensor 
      technologies made it possible to continuously monitor physiological parameters 
      using wearable biosensors with a variety of form factors. OBJECTIVE: To explore 
      the potential of using wearable biosensors to continuously monitor 
      multidimensional physiological parameters for early detection of COVID-19 
      clinical progression. METHOD: This randomised controlled open-labelled trial will 
      involve 200-1000 asymptomatic subjects with close COVID-19 contact under 
      mandatory quarantine at designated facilities in Hong Kong. Subjects will be 
      randomised to receive a remote monitoring strategy (intervention group) or 
      standard strategy (control group) in a 1:1 ratio during the 14 day-quarantine 
      period. In addition to fever and symptom surveillance in the control group, 
      subjects in the intervention group will wear wearable biosensors on their arms to 
      continuously monitor skin temperature, respiratory rate, blood pressure, pulse 
      rate, blood oxygen saturation and daily activities. These physiological 
      parameters will be transferred in real time to a smartphone application called 
      Biovitals Sentinel. These data will then be processed using a cloud-based 
      multivariate physiology analytics engine called Biovitals to detect subtle 
      physiological changes. The results will be displayed on a web-based dashboard for 
      clinicians' review. The primary outcome is the time to diagnosis of COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The number of solid organ transplants in Canada has increased 33% 
      over the past decade. Hospital readmissions are common within the first year 
      after transplant and are linked to increased morbidity and mortality. Nearly half 
      of these admissions to the hospital appear to be preventable. Mobile health 
      (mHealth) technologies hold promise to reduce admission to the hospital and 
      improve patient outcomes, as they allow real-time monitoring and timely clinical 
      intervention. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine whether an innovative 
      mHealth intervention can reduce hospital readmission and unscheduled visits to 
      the emergency department or transplant clinic. Our second objective is to assess 
      the use of clinical and continuous ambulatory physiologic data to develop machine 
      learning algorithms to predict the risk of infection, organ rejection, and early 
      mortality in adult heart, kidney, and liver transplant recipients. METHODS: 
      Remote Mobile Outpatient Monitoring in Transplant (Reboot) 2.0 is a two-phased 
      single-center study to be conducted at the University Health Network in Toronto, 
      Canada. Phase one will consist of a 1-year concealed randomized controlled trial 
      of 400 adult heart, kidney, and liver transplant recipients. Participants will be 
      randomized to receive either personalized communication using an mHealth app in 
      addition to standard of care phone communication (intervention group) or standard 
      of care communication only (control group). In phase two, the prior collected 
      data set will be used to develop machine learning algorithms to identify early 
      markers of rejection, infection, and graft dysfunction posttransplantation. The 
      primary outcome will be a composite of any unscheduled hospital admission, visits 
      to the emergency department or transplant clinic, following discharge from the 
      index admission. Secondary outcomes will include patient-reported outcomes using 
      validated self-administered questionnaires, 1-year graft survival rate, 1-year 
      patient survival rate, and the number of standard of care phone voice messages. 
      RESULTS: At the time of this paper's completion, no results are available. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Building from previous work, this project will aim to leverage an 
      innovative mHealth app to improve outcomes and reduce hospital readmission in 
      adult solid organ transplant recipients. Additionally, the development of machine 
      learning algorithms to better predict adverse health outcomes will allow for 
      personalized medicine to tailor clinician-patient interactions and mitigate the 
      health care burden of a growing patient population. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

AB  - Purpose: To propose a deep-learning-based approach to automatically and 
      objectively evaluate morphologic eyelid features using two-dimensional(2D) 
      digital photographs and to assess the agreement between automatic and manual 
      measurements.Materials and Methods: The 2D photographs of 1378 normal Asian 
      participants (2756 eyes) were included for training, validating and testing the 
      cornea and eyelid segmentation network. Margin reflex distance 1 (MRD1) and 
      margin reflex distance 2 (MRD2) of 406 eyes from 203 participants were manually 
      evaluated by 3 ophthalmologists and the photographs of 406 eyes were measured 
      automatically for 8 morphologic eyelid features. The Spearman's correlation 
      coefficient, intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland-Altman analyses 
      were used to determine the agreement between manual and automatic MRDs.Results: 
      The dice coefficient was 0.922 and 0.974 for eyelid and cornea segmentation, 
      respectively. A strong correlation was shown between manually and automatically 
      measured MRD1 (r = 0.993, ICC = 0.996) and MRD2 (r = 0.950, ICC = 0.974). 
      Bland-Altman analyses also showed excellent reliability with bias being 
      0.04 mmbetween automated and manual MRD1 measurements and 0.06 mm for MRD2. 
      Automatically measured 8 features (MRD1, MRD2, palpebral fissure, medial area, 
      lateral area, cornea area, upper and lower eyelid lengths) were found to be 
      increased with age and peaked around the age range of 21 to 30 years.Conclusions: 
      The proposed novel integrative analysis scheme was comparable with human 
      performance. The approach with excellent reliability and reproductivity showed 
      great potential for automated diagnosis and remote monitoring of eyelid-related 
      diseases.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: A modern and accessible healthcare system requires digital 
      innovation and connectivity. The term "Digital health" covers vide range 
      technologies, such as mobile health and applications, electronic records, 
      telehealth and telemedicine, wearable devices, robotics, virtual reality and 
      artificial intelligence. METHODS: Scientometrics is the method that we have done 
      in this study by Cite Space and VOSviewer software, and the result of searching 
      the Web of Science database in plain text format to perform analysis and 
      scientometrics and create outputs in the form of graphs and tables in the field 
      of digital health has been used in stroke rehabilitation. RESULT: A total of 2933 
      documents related to digital health technologies in stroke rehabilitation were 
      identified by searching for the terms "stroke rehabilitation" or "stroke 
      recovery" in the title and "digital health" across all fields. The strongest 
      citations related to cerebrovascular disease spanned from 1994 to 2007, with 
      randomised clinical trials occurring almost simultaneously and ended by 2012. 
      Consequently, stroke rehabilitation by virtual reality technology has obtained 
      the most citations and clinical trials and as an important part of digital health 
      in the future research process. CONCLUSION: This scientometric study offers 
      insights into how digital health technology can assist stroke patients in 
      self-managing their health and well-being, in addition to supporting integrated 
      stroke rehabilitation. The analysis revealed that three themes were present: 
      author contributors and collaboration networks, temporal evolution, the strongest 
      citation explosions for digital health technologies in stroke rehabilitation 
      research, and semantic analysis.

OAB - The new technology for helping stroke patients get better is a big help to many 
      people with health problems.Newer technologies are now more common, and more 
      patients are using remote health care monitoring. We need to do more research to 
      figure out if these digital health technologies work well over a long period of 
      time.This study connects digital technology and stroke rehab research. It looks 
      at different research areas and trends, and gives a wider view than other similar 
      studies. The findings show where more research should be done and help 
      researchers work together in different areas to improve our knowledge of stroke 
      rehabilitation.

AB  - Undiagnosed malnutrition is a significant problem in high-income countries, which 
      can reduce the quality of life of many individuals, particularly of older adults. 
      Moreover, it can also inflate the costs of existing health care systems because 
      of the many metabolic complications that it can cause. The current methods for 
      assessing malnutrition can be cumbersome. A trained practitioner must be present 
      to conduct an assessment, or patients must travel to facilities with specialized 
      equipment to obtain their measurements. Therefore, digital health care is a 
      possible way of closing this gap as it is rapidly gaining traction as a scalable 
      means of improving efficiency in the health care system. It allows for the remote 
      monitoring of nutritional status without requiring the physical presence of 
      practitioners or the use of advanced medical equipment. As such, there is an 
      increasing interest in expanding the range of digital applications to facilitate 
      remote monitoring and management of health issues. In this study, we discuss the 
      feasibility of a novel digital remote method for diagnosing malnutrition using 
      facial morphometrics. Many malnutrition screening assessments include subjective 
      assessments of the head and the face. Facial appearance is often used by 
      clinicians as the first point of qualitative indication of health status. Hence, 
      there may be merit in quantifying these subtle but observable changes using 
      facial morphometrics. Modern advancements in artificial intelligence, data 
      science, sensors, and computing technologies allow facial features to be 
      accurately digitized, which could potentially allow these previously intuitive 
      assessments to be quantified. This study aims to stimulate further discussion and 
      discourse on how this emerging technology can be used to provide real-time access 
      to nutritional status. The use of facial morphometrics extends the use of 
      currently available technology and may provide a scalable, easily deployable 
      solution for nutritional status to be monitored in real time. This will enable 
      clinicians and dietitians to keep track of patients remotely and provide the 
      necessary intervention measures as required, as well as providing health care 
      institutions and policy makers with essential information that can be used to 
      inform and enable targeted public health approaches within affected populations.

AB  - Pig farming, a vital industry, necessitates proactive measures for early disease 
      detection and crush symptom monitoring to ensure optimum pig health and safety. 
      This review explores advanced thermal sensing technologies and computer 
      vision-based thermal imaging techniques employed for pig disease and piglet crush 
      symptom monitoring on pig farms. Infrared thermography (IRT) is a non-invasive 
      and efficient technology for measuring pig body temperature, providing advantages 
      such as non-destructive, long-distance, and high-sensitivity measurements. Unlike 
      traditional methods, IRT offers a quick and labor-saving approach to acquiring 
      physiological data impacted by environmental temperature, crucial for 
      understanding pig body physiology and metabolism. IRT aids in early disease 
      detection, respiratory health monitoring, and evaluating vaccination 
      effectiveness. Challenges include body surface emissivity variations affecting 
      measurement accuracy. Thermal imaging and deep learning algorithms are used for 
      pig behavior recognition, with the dorsal plane effective for stress detection. 
      Remote health monitoring through thermal imaging, deep learning, and wearable 
      devices facilitates non-invasive assessment of pig health, minimizing medication 
      use. Integration of advanced sensors, thermal imaging, and deep learning shows 
      potential for disease detection and improvement in pig farming, but challenges 
      and ethical considerations must be addressed for successful implementation. This 
      review summarizes the state-of-the-art technologies used in the pig farming 
      industry, including computer vision algorithms such as object detection, image 
      segmentation, and deep learning techniques. It also discusses the benefits and 
      limitations of IRT technology, providing an overview of the current research 
      field. This study provides valuable insights for researchers and farmers 
      regarding IRT application in pig production, highlighting notable approaches and 
      the latest research findings in this field.

TI  - Management and Treatment of Patients With Obstructive Sleep Apnea Using an 
      Intelligent Monitoring System Based on Machine Learning Aiming to Improve 
      Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Treatment Compliance: Randomized Controlled 
      Trial.
PG  - e24072
LID - 10.2196/24072 [doi]
LID - e24072
AB  - BACKGROUND: Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is an effective treatment 
      for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), but treatment compliance is often 
      unsatisfactory. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness 
      and cost-effectiveness of an intelligent monitoring system for improving CPAP 
      compliance. METHODS: This is a prospective, open label, parallel, randomized 
      controlled trial including 60 newly diagnosed patients with OSA requiring CPAP 
      (Apnea-Hypopnea Index [AHI] >15) from Lleida, Spain. Participants were randomized 
      (1:1) to standard management or the MiSAOS intelligent monitoring system, 
      involving (1) early compliance detection, thus providing measures of patient's 
      CPAP compliance from the very first days of usage; (2) machine learning-based 
      prediction of midterm future CPAP compliance; and (3) rule-based recommendations 
      for the patient (app) and care team. Clinical and anthropometric variables, 
      daytime sleepiness, and quality of life were recorded at baseline and after 6 
      months, together with patient's compliance, satisfaction, and health care costs. 
      RESULTS: Randomized patients had a mean age of 57 (SD 11) years, mean AHI of 50 
      (SD 27), and 13% (8/60) were women. Patients in the intervention arm had a mean 
      (95% CI) of 1.14 (0.04-2.23) hours/day higher adjusted CPAP compliance than 
      controls (P=.047). Patients' satisfaction was excellent in both arms, and up to 
      88% (15/17) of intervention patients reported willingness to keep using the 
      MiSAOS app in the future. No significant differences were found in costs 
      (control: mean €90.2 (SD 53.14) (US $105.76 [SD 62.31]); intervention: mean €96.2 
      (SD 62.13) (US $112.70 [SD 72.85]); P=.70; €1=US $1.17 was considered 
      throughout). Overall costs combined with results on compliance demonstrated 
      cost-effectiveness in a bootstrap-based simulation analysis. CONCLUSIONS: A 
      machine learning-based intelligent monitoring system increased daily compliance, 
      reported excellent patient satisfaction similar to that reported in usual care, 
      and did not incur in a substantial increase in costs, thus proving 
      cost-effectiveness. This study supports the implementation of intelligent eHealth 
      frameworks for the management of patients with CPAP-treated OSA and confirms the 
      value of patients' empowerment in the management of chronic diseases. TRIAL

      Data.

AB  - The application of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques in the 
      medical world is growing, with a range of purposes: from the identification and 
      prediction of possible diseases to patient monitoring and clinical decision 
      support systems. Furthermore, the widespread use of remote monitoring medical 
      devices, under the umbrella of the "Internet of Medical Things" (IoMT), has 
      simplified the retrieval of patient information as they allow continuous 
      monitoring and direct access to data by healthcare providers. However, due to 
      possible issues in real-world settings, such as loss of connectivity, irregular 
      use, misuse, or poor adherence to a monitoring program, the data collected might 
      not be sufficient to implement accurate algorithms. For this reason, data 
      augmentation techniques can be used to create synthetic datasets sufficiently 
      large to train machine learning models. In this work, we apply the concept of 
      generative adversarial networks (GANs) to perform a data augmentation from 
      patient data obtained through IoMT sensors for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary 
      Disease (COPD) monitoring. We also apply an explainable AI algorithm to

TI  - A Narrative Review of Current Status and Future Perspective of Telemedicine for 
      Parkinson's Disease, Dementia, and Intractable Neurological Diseases in Japan.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has uncovered several inherent problems in 
      society. While the demand for telemedicine surged worldwide and some countries 
      responded flexibly, in Japan, most telemedicine services were limited to 
      telephone consultations, and full-fledged telemedicine did not become widespread. 
      In addition, the digitalization process in both medicine and wider society lags 
      behind some other nations. It is necessary to accelerate digital transformation 
      in healthcare to build a sustainable society that is resilient to crises, such as 
      new pandemics. In particular, as Japan is facing an issue of super-aged society, 
      a sustainable care model for people with Parkinson's disease, dementia, and 
      intractable neurological diseases should be established. Many neurodegenerative 
      and intractable neurological diseases are progressive; as the disease progresses, 
      patients could become difficult to visit specialists. Although online medical 
      care has many advantages, it does not provide the same quality of information as 
      face-to-face consultations. However, new technology can overcome the limitations 
      of online medical care. As an evolutionary direction for telemedicine, 
      three-dimensional telemedicine technologies are being developed, which enable 
      online medical treatment to be delivered as if the patient was sharing the same 
      space. Telemonitoring can enable the objective and continuous evaluation of 
      patient information at home through the use of motion capture, wearable devices, 
      and other devices. The advancement of digital transformation in medical care 
      should be a game-changer in accumulating big data and analyzing it using 
      artificial intelligence.

TI  - Machine learning-based motor assessment of Parkinson's disease using postural 
      sway, gait and lifestyle features on crowdsourced smartphone data.
PG  - 035005
LID - 10.1088/2057-1976/ab39a8 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Remote assessment of gait in patients' homes has become a valuable 
      tool for monitoring the progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, these 
      measurements are often not as accurate or reliable as clinical evaluations 
      because it is challenging to objectively distinguish the unique gait 
      characteristics of PD. We explore the inference of patients' stage of PD from 
      their gait using machine learning analyses of data gathered from their smartphone 
      sensors. Specifically, we investigate supervised machine learning (ML) models to 
      classify the severity of the motor part of the UPDRS (MDS-UPDRS 2.10-2.13). Our 
      goals are to facilitate remote monitoring of PD patients and to answer the 
      following questions: (1) What is the patient PD stage based on their gait? (2) 
      Which features are best for understanding and classifying PD gait severities? (3) 
      Which ML classifier types best discriminate PD patients from healthy controls 
      (HC)? and (4) Which ML classifier types can discriminate the severity of PD gait 
      anomalies? METHODOLOGY: Our work uses smartphone sensor data gathered from 9520 
      patients in the mPower study, of whom 3101 participants uploaded gait recordings 
      and 344 subjects and 471 controls uploaded at least 3 walking activities. We 
      selected 152 PD patients who performed at least 3 recordings before and 3 
      recordings after taking medications and 304 HC who performed at least 3 walking 
      recordings. From the accelerometer and gyroscope sensor data, we extracted 
      statistical, time, wavelet and frequency domain features, and other lifestyle 
      features were derived directly from participants' survey data. We conducted 
      supervised classification experiments using 10-fold cross-validation and measured 
      the model precision, accuracy, and area under the curve (AUC). RESULTS: The best 
      classification model, best feature, highest classification accuracy, and AUC were 
      (1) random forest and entropy rate, 93% and 0.97, respectively, for walking 
      balance (MDS-UPDRS-2.12); (2) bagged trees and MinMaxDiff, 95% and 0.92, 
      respectively, for shaking/tremor (MDS-UPDRS-2.10); (3) bagged trees and entropy 
      rate, 98% and 0.98, respectively, for freeze of gait; and (4) random forest and 
      MinMaxDiff, 95% and 0.99, respectively, for distinguishing PD patients from HC. 
      CONCLUSION: Machine learning classification was challenging due to the use of 
      data that were subjectively labeled based on patients' answers to the MDS-UPDRS 
      survey questions. However, with use of a significantly larger number of subjects 
      than in prior work and clinically validated gait features, we were able to 
      demonstrate that automatic patient classification based on smartphone sensor data 
      can be used to objectively infer the severity of PD and the extent of specific 
      gait anomalies.

TI  - Validation of a Point-of-Care Optical Coherence Tomography Device with Machine 
      Learning Algorithm for Detection of Oral Potentially Malignant and Malignant 
      Lesions.
LID - 10.3390/cancers13143583 [doi]

AB  - Non-invasive strategies that can identify oral malignant and dysplastic oral 
      potentially-malignant lesions (OPML) are necessary in cancer screening and 
      long-term surveillance. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) can be a rapid, real 
      time and non-invasive imaging method for frequent patient surveillance. Here, we 
      report the validation of a portable, robust OCT device in 232 patients (lesions: 
      347) in different clinical settings. The device deployed with algorithm-based 
      automated diagnosis, showed efficacy in delineation of oral benign and normal (n 
      = 151), OPML (n = 121), and malignant lesions (n = 75) in community and tertiary 
      care settings. This study showed that OCT images analyzed by automated image 
      processing algorithm could distinguish the dysplastic-OPML and malignant lesions 
      with a sensitivity of 95% and 93%, respectively. Furthermore, we explored the 
      ability of multiple (n = 14) artificial neural network (ANN) based feature 
      extraction techniques for delineation high grade-OPML (moderate/severe 
      dysplasia). The support vector machine (SVM) model built over ANN, delineated 
      high-grade dysplasia with sensitivity of 83%, which in turn, can be employed to 
      triage patients for tertiary care. The study provides evidence towards the 
      utility of the robust and low-cost OCT instrument as a point-of-care device in 
      resource-constrained settings and the potential clinical application of device in 
      screening and surveillance of oral cancer.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven adaptive techniques are viable to optimize 
      the resources in the Internet of Things (IoT) enabled wearable healthcare 
      devices. Due to the miniature size and ability of wireless data transfer, Body 
      Sensor Networks (BSNs) have become the center of attention in current medical 
      media technologies. For a long-term and reliable healthcare system, high energy 
      efficiency, transmission reliability, and longer battery lifetime of wearable 
      sensors devices are required. There is a dire need for empowering sensor-based 
      wearable techniques in BSNs from every aspect i.e., data collection, healthcare 
      monitoring, and diagnosis. The consideration of protocol layers, data routing, 
      and energy optimization strategies improves the efficiency of healthcare 
      delivery. Hence, this work presents some key contributions. Firstly, it proposes 
      a novel avant-garde framework to simultaneously optimize the energy efficiency, 
      battery lifetime, and reliability for smart and connected healthcare. Secondly, 
      in this study, an Adaptive Transmission Data Rate (ATDR) mechanism is proposed, 
      which works on the average constant energy consumption by varying the active time 
      of the sensor node to optimize the energy over the dynamic wireless channel. 
      Moreover, a Self-Adaptive Routing Algorithm (SARA) is developed to adopt a 
      dynamic source routing mechanism with an energy-efficient and shortest possible 
      path, unlike the conventional routing methods. Lastly, real-time datasets are 
      adopted for intensive experimental setup for revealing pervasive and 
      cost-effective healthcare through wearable devices. It is observed and analysed 
      that proposed algorithms outperform in terms of high energy efficiency, better 
      reliability, and longer battery lifetime of portable devices.

TI  - Breathable Ti(3)C(2)T(x) MXene/Protein Nanocomposites for Ultrasensitive Medical 
      Pressure Sensor with Degradability in Solvents.
PG  - 9746-9758

AB  - Flexible, breathable, and degradable pressure sensors with excellent sensing 
      performance are drawing tremendous attention for various practical applications 
      in wearable artificial skins, healthcare monitoring, and artificial intelligence 
      due to their flexibility, breathability, lightweight, decreased electronic 
      rubbish, and environmentally friendly impact. However, traditional plastic or 
      elastomer substrates with impermeability, uncomfortableness, mechanical 
      mismatches, and nondegradability greatly restricted their practical applications. 
      Therefore, the fabrication of such pressure sensors with high flexibility, facile 
      degradability, and breathability is still a critical challenge and highly 
      desired. Herein, we present a wearable, breathable, degradable, and highly 
      sensitive MXene/protein nanocomposites-based pressure sensor. The fabricated 
      MXene/protein-based pressure sensor is assembled from a breathable conductive 
      MXene coated silk fibroin nanofiber (MXene-SF) membrane and a silk fibroin 
      nanofiber membrane patterned with a MXene ink-printed (MXene ink-SF) 
      interdigitated electrode, which can serve as the sensing layer and the electrode 
      layer, respectively. The assembled pressure sensor exhibits a wide sensing range 
      (up to 39.3 kPa), high sensitivity (298.4 kPa(-1) for 1.4-15.7 kPa; 171.9 kPa(-1) 
      for 15.7-39.3 kPa), fast response/recovery time (7/16 ms), reliable 
      breathability, excellent cycling stability over 10 000 cycles, good 
      biocompatibility, and robust degradability. Furthermore, it shows great sensing 
      performance in monitoring human psychological signals, acting as an artificial 
      skin for the quantitative illustration of pressure distribution, and wireless 
      biomonitoring in real time. Considering the biodegradable and breathable 
      features, the sensor may become promising to find potential applications in smart 
      electronic skins, human motion detection, disease diagnosis, and human-machine 
      interaction.

TI  - Digital Health in Cardiac Rehabilitation and Secondary Prevention: A Search for 
      the Ideal Tool.
LID - 10.3390/s21010012 [doi]
LID - 12
AB  - Digital health is becoming more integrated in daily medical practice. In 
      cardiology, patient care is already moving from the hospital to the patients' 
      homes, with large trials showing positive results in the field of telemonitoring 
      via cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs), monitoring of pulmonary 
      artery pressure via implantable devices, telemonitoring via home-based 
      non-invasive sensors, and screening for atrial fibrillation via smartphone and 
      smartwatch technology. Cardiac rehabilitation and secondary prevention are 
      modalities that could greatly benefit from digital health integration, as current 
      compliance and cardiac rehabilitation participation rates are low and 
      optimisation is urgently required. This viewpoint offers a perspective on current 
      use of digital health technologies in cardiac rehabilitation, heart failure and 
      secondary prevention. Important barriers which need to be addressed for 
      implementation in medical practice are discussed. To conclude, a future ideal 
      digital tool and integrated healthcare system are envisioned. To overcome 
      personal, technological, and legal barriers, technological development should 
      happen in dialog with patients and caregivers. Aided by digital technology, a 
      future could be realised in which we are able to offer high-quality, affordable, 
      personalised healthcare in a patient-centred way.

AB  - A smart city is an intelligent space, in which large amounts of data are 
      collected and analyzed using low-cost sensors and automatic algorithms. The 
      application of artificial intelligence and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies 
      in electronic health (E-health) can efficiently promote the development of 
      sustainable and smart cities. The IoT sensors and intelligent algorithms enable 
      the remote monitoring and analyzing of the healthcare data of patients, which 
      reduces the medical and travel expenses in cities. Existing deep learning-based 
      methods for healthcare sensor data classification have made great achievements. 
      However, these methods take much time and storage space for model training and 
      inference. They are difficult to be deployed in small devices to classify the 
      physiological signal of patients in real time. To solve the above problems, this 
      paper proposes a micro time series classification model called the micro neural 
      network (MicroNN). The proposed model is micro enough to be deployed on tiny edge 
      devices. MicroNN can be applied to long-term physiological signal monitoring 
      based on edge computing devices. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate 
      the classification accuracy and computation complexity of MicroNN. Experiment 
      results show that MicroNN performs better than the state-of-the-art methods. The 
      accuracies on the two datasets (MIT-BIH-AR and INCART) are 98.4% and 98.1%, 
      respectively. Finally, we present an application to show how MicroNN can improve 
      the development of sustainable and smart cities.

TI  - An Automatic Gait Analysis Pipeline for Wearable Sensors: A Pilot Study in 
      Parkinson's Disease.
LID - 10.3390/s21248286 [doi]
LID - 8286
AB  - The use of wearable sensors allows continuous recordings of physical activity 
      from participants in free-living or at-home clinical studies. The large amount of 
      data collected demands automatic analysis pipelines to extract gait parameters 
      that can be used as clinical endpoints. We introduce a deep learning-based 
      automatic pipeline for wearables that processes tri-axial accelerometry data and 
      extracts gait events-bout segmentation, initial contact (IC), and final contact 
      (FC)-from a single sensor located at either the lower back (near L5), shin or 
      wrist. The gait events detected are posteriorly used for gait parameter 
      estimation, such as step time, length, and symmetry. We report results from a 
      leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) validation on a pilot study dataset of five 
      participants clinically diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (PD) and six healthy 
      controls (HC). Participants wore sensors at three body locations and walked on a 
      pressure-sensing walkway to obtain reference gait data. Mean absolute errors 
      (MAE) for the IC events ranged from 22.82 to 33.09 milliseconds (msecs) for the 
      lower back sensor while for the shin and wrist sensors, MAE ranges were 
      28.56-64.66 and 40.19-72.50 msecs, respectively. For the FC-event detection, MAE 
      ranges were 29.06-48.42, 40.19-72.70 and 36.06-60.18 msecs for the lumbar, wrist 
      and shin sensors, respectively. Intraclass correlation coefficients, ICC(2,k), 
      between the estimated parameters and the reference data resulted in 
      good-to-excellent agreement (ICC ≥ 0.84) for the lumbar and shin sensors, 
      excluding the double support time (ICC = 0.37 lumbar and 0.38 shin) and swing 
      time (ICC = 0.55 lumbar and 0.59 shin). The wrist sensor also showed good 
      agreements, but the ICCs were lower overall than for the other two sensors. Our 
      proposed analysis pipeline has the potential to extract up to 100 gait-related 
      parameters, and we expect our contribution will further support developments in 
      the fields of wearable sensors, digital health, and remote monitoring in clinical 
      trials.

TI  - Nurse-in-the-loop smart home detection of health events associated with diagnosed

AB  - BACKGROUND: Telehealth and home-based care options significantly expanded during 
      the SARS-CoV2 pandemic. Sophisticated, remote monitoring technologies now exist 
      that support at-home care. Advances in the research of smart homes for health 
      monitoring have shown these technologies are capable of recognizing and 
      predicting health changes in near-real time. However, few nurses are familiar 
      enough with this technology to use smart homes for optimizing patient care or 
      expanding their reach into the home between healthcare touch points. OBJECTIVE: 
      The objective of this work is to explore a partnership between nurses and smart 
      homes for automated remote monitoring and assessing of patient health. We present 
      a series of health event cases to demonstrate how this partnership may be 
      harnessed to effectively detect and report on clinically relevant health events 
      that can be automatically detected by smart homes. PARTICIPANTS: 25 participants 
      with multiple chronic health conditions. METHODS: Ambient sensors were installed 
      in the homes of 25 participants with multiple chronic health conditions. Motion, 
      light, temperature, and door usage data were continuously collected from 
      participants' homes. Descriptions of health events and participants' associated 
      behaviors were captured via weekly nursing telehealth visits with study 
      participants and used to analyze sensor data representing health events. Two 
      cases of participants with congestive heart failure exacerbations, one case of 
      urinary tract infection, two cases of bowel inflammation flares, and four cases 
      of participants with sleep interruption were explored. RESULTS: For each case, 
      clinically relevant health events aligned with changes from baseline in behavior 
      data patterns derived from sensors installed in the participant's home. In some 
      cases, the detected event was precipitated by additional behavior patterns that 
      could be used to predict the event. CONCLUSIONS: We found evidence in this case 
      series that continuous sensor-based monitoring of patient behavior in home 
      settings may be used to provide automated detection of health events. Nursing 
      insights into smart home sensor data could be used to initiate preventive 
      strategies and provide timely intervention. TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: Nurses partnered 
      with smart homes could detect exacerbations of health conditions at home leading 
      to early intervention.

AB  - Current wearable sensors are fabricated with substrates, which limits the 
      comfort, flexibility, stretchability, and induces interface mismatch. In 
      addition, the substrate prevents the evaporation of sweat and is harmful to skin 
      health. In this work, we have enabled the substrate-free laser scribed graphene 
      (SFG) electronic skin (e-skin) with multifunctions. Compared with the e-skin with 
      the substrate, the SFG has good gas permeability, low impedance, and flexibility. 
      Only assisted using water, the SFG can be transferred to almost any objects 
      including silicon and human skin and it can even be suspended. Many through-holes 
      like stomas in leaf can be formed in the SFG, which make it breathable. After 
      designing the pattern, the gauge factor (GF) of graphene electronic skin (GES) 
      can be designed as the strain sensor. Physiological signals such as respiration, 
      human motion, and electrocardiogram (ECG) can be detected. Moreover, the 
      suspended SFG detect vibrations with high sensitivity. Due to the substrate-free 
      structure, the impedance between SFG e-skin and the human body decreases greatly. 
      Finally, an ECG detecting system has been designed based on the GES, which can 
      monitor the body condition in real time. To analyze the ECG signals 
      automatically, a convolutional neural network (CNN) was built and trained 
      successfully. This work has high potential in the field of health telemonitoring.

AB  - Sweat-activated batteries (SABs) are lightweight, biocompatible energy generators 
      that produce sufficient power for skin-interface electronic devices. However, the 
      fabrication of 1D SABs that are compatible with conventional textile techniques 
      for self-powered wearable electronics remains challenging. In this study, a 
      cotton-yarn-based SAB (CYSAB) with a segmental structure is developed, in which 
      carbon-black-modified, pristine yarn and Zn foil-wrapped segments are prepared to 
      serve as the cathode, salt bridge, and anode, respectively. Upon electrolyte 
      absorption, the CYSAB can be rapidly activated. Its performance is closely 
      related to the ion concentration, infiltrated electrolyte volume, and evaporation 
      rate. The CYSAB can tolerate repeated bending and washing without any significant 
      influence on its power output. Moreover, the CYSABs can be woven into fabrics and 
      connected in series and parallel configurations to produce an energy supplying 
      headband, which can be activated by the sweat secreted from a volunteer during a 
      cycling exercise to power light-emitting diode headlights. The developed CYSAB 
      can also be integrated with yarn-based strain sensors to achieve a smart textile 
      for the self-powered sensing of human motion and breathing. This weavable, 
      washable, and scalable CYSAB is expected to contribute to the manufacturing of 
      self-powered smart textiles for future applications in wearable healthcare 
      monitoring.

AB  - Hospital readmission prediction models often perform poorly, but most only use 
      information collected until the time of hospital discharge. In this clinical 
      trial, we randomly assigned 500 patients discharged from hospital to home to use 
      either a smartphone or wearable device to collect and transmit remote patient 
      monitoring (RPM) data on activity patterns after hospital discharge. Analyses 
      were conducted at the patient-day level using discrete-time survival analysis. 
      Each arm was split into training and testing folds. The training set used 
      fivefold cross-validation and then final model results are from predictions on 
      the test set. A standard model comprised data collected up to the time of 
      discharge including demographics, comorbidities, hospital length of stay, and 
      vitals prior to discharge. An enhanced model consisted of the standard model plus 
      RPM data. Traditional parametric regression models (logit and lasso) were 
      compared to nonparametric machine learning approaches (random forest, gradient 
      boosting, and ensemble). The main outcome was hospital readmission or death 
      within 30 days of discharge. Prediction of 30-day hospital readmission 
      significantly improved when including remotely-monitored patient data on activity 
      patterns after hospital discharge and using nonparametric machine learning 
      approaches. Wearables slightly outperformed smartphones but both had good 
      prediction of 30-day hospital-readmission.

TI  - Knowledge, Awareness and Practice of Artificial Intelligence and Types of 
      Realities Among Healthcare Professionals: A Nationwide Survey From Pakistan.

AB  - Background Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human 
      intelligence processes by machines, enabling them to perform tasks. The 
      advancements in AI have also improved virtual reality (VR), augmented reality 
      (AR) and mixed reality (MR) experience allowing a greater opportunity for use in 
      the field of medicine. Objective To evaluate the knowledge, attitude and practice 
      of AI and types of realities among Pakistani healthcare professionals (HCPs). 
      Materials and methods This was a prospective, nationwide study designed at the 
      Department of Neurosurgery at Punjab Institute of Neurosciences (PINS), Lahore, 
      was conducted between January 2024 to February 2024. More than 500 HCPs were 
      approached, out of which 176 participated in this survey consensually. A 
      pre-formed general questionnaire based on knowledge, attitude and practices of AI 
      and types of realities was modified according to local conditions. Google Forms 
      (Google Inc., USA) was used to conduct the one-time sign up response. Statistical 
      Package for Social Sciences (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 24, USA) 
      was used to analyze submitted responses. Results About 69.9% respondents were 
      male HCPs. Most of the respondents were from the fields of neurosurgery, medicine 
      and general surgery, i.e., 10.80%, 10.20% and 4%, respectively. More than 90% 
      HCPs used Internet and electronic devices daily. A majority of 62.50% respondents 
      agreed that AI brings benefits for the patients, while at the same time, 45.50% 
      agreed that they would not trust the assessment of AI more than that of HCPs. 61% 
      HCPs feared that AI-based systems could be manipulated from the outside sources, 
      like terrorists and hackers. Although 90% respondents knew the definition of AR 
      and VR, a strikingly low 40% respondents could only identify the practical 
      applications of these realities when asked in a mini-quiz. About 61.40% HCPs 
      never used any AI-based application throughout their clinical practice, but 
      Google Health was used by 29.50% respondents, followed by Remote Patient 
      Monitoring AI application used by 3.4% individuals. Conclusion There is an 
      evident under-utilization of AI and types of realities in clinical practice in 
      Pakistan. Lack of awareness, paucity of resources and conventional clinical 
      practices are the key reasons identified. Pakistan is on the path towards the 
      point where the developed world is currently. There is a potential to move past 
      the initial stages of AI implementation and into more advanced modes of adopting 
      AI and types of realities.

TI  - Harnessing the Power of Smart and Connected Health to Tackle COVID-19: IoT, AI, 
      Robotics, and Blockchain for a Better World.
PG  - 12826-12846
LID - 10.1109/JIOT.2021.3073904 [doi]
AB  - As COVID-19 hounds the world, the common cause of finding a swift solution to 
      manage the pandemic has brought together researchers, institutions, governments, 
      and society at large. The Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence 
      (AI)-including machine learning (ML) and Big Data analytics-as well as Robotics 
      and Blockchain, are the four decisive areas of technological innovation that have 
      been ingenuity harnessed to fight this pandemic and future ones. While these 
      highly interrelated smart and connected health technologies cannot resolve the 
      pandemic overnight and may not be the only answer to the crisis, they can provide 
      greater insight into the disease and support frontline efforts to prevent and 
      control the pandemic. This article provides a blend of discussions on the 
      contribution of these digital technologies, propose several complementary and 
      multidisciplinary techniques to combat COVID-19, offer opportunities for more 
      holistic studies, and accelerate knowledge acquisition and scientific discoveries 
      in pandemic research. First, four areas, where IoT can contribute are discussed, 
      namely: 1) tracking and tracing; 2) remote patient monitoring (RPM) by wearable 
      IoT (WIoT); 3) personal digital twins (PDTs); and 4) real-life use case: ICT/IoT 
      solution in South Korea. Second, the role and novel applications of AI are 
      explained, namely: 1) diagnosis and prognosis; 2) risk prediction; 3) vaccine and 
      drug development; 4) research data set; 5) early warnings and alerts; 6) social 
      control and fake news detection; and 7) communication and chatbot. Third, the 
      main uses of robotics and drone technology are analyzed, including: 1) crowd 
      surveillance; 2) public announcements; 3) screening and diagnosis; and 4) 
      essential supply delivery. Finally, we discuss how distributed ledger 
      technologies (DLTs), of which blockchain is a common example, can be combined 
      with other technologies for tackling COVID-19.

TI  - Advanced Hemodynamic Monitoring Allows Recognition of Early Response Patterns to 
      Diuresis in Congestive Heart Failure Patients.
LID - 10.3390/jcm12010045 [doi]
LID - 45
AB  - There are no clear guidelines for diuretic administration in heart failure (HF), 
      and reliable markers are needed to tailor treatment. Continuous monitoring of 
      multiple advanced physiological parameters during diuresis may allow better 
      differentiation of patients into subgroups according to their responses. In this 
      study, 29 HF patients were monitored during outpatient intravenous diuresis, 
      using a noninvasive wearable multi-parameter monitor. Analysis of changes in 
      these parameters during the course of diuresis aimed to recognize subgroups with 
      different response patterns. Parameters did not change significantly, however, 
      subgroup analysis of the last quartile of treatment showed significant 
      differences in cardiac output, cardiac index, stroke volume, pulse rate, and 
      systemic vascular resistance according to gender, and in systolic blood pressure 
      according to habitus. Changes in the last quartile could be differentiated using 
      k-means, a technique of unsupervised machine learning. Moreover, patients' 
      responses could be best clustered into four groups. Analysis of baseline 
      parameters showed that two of the clusters differed by baseline parameters, body 
      mass index, and diabetes status. To conclude, we show that physiological changes 
      during diuresis in HF patients can be categorized into subgroups sharing similar 
      response trends, making noninvasive monitoring a potential key to personalized 
      treatment in HF.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the existence of evidence-based rehabilitation strategies 
      that address biomechanical deficits, the persistence of recurrent ankle problems 
      in 70% of patients with acute ankle sprains highlights the unresolved nature of 
      this issue. Artificial intelligence (AI) emerges as a promising tool to identify 
      definitive predictors for ankle sprains. This paper aims to summarize the use of 
      AI in investigating the ankle biomechanics of healthy and subjects with ankle 
      sprains. METHODS: Articles published between 2010 and 2023 were searched from 
      five electronic databases. 59 papers were included for analysis with regards to: 
      i). types of motion tested (functional vs. purposeful ankle movement); ii) types 
      of biomechanical parameters measured (kinetic vs kinematic); iii) types of sensor 
      systems used (lab-based vs field-based); and, iv) AI techniques used. FINDINGS: 
      Most studies (83.1%) examined biomechanics during functional motion. Single 
      kinematic parameter, specifically ankle range of motion, could obtain accuracy up 
      to 100% in identifying injury status. Wearable sensor exhibited high reliability 
      for use in both laboratory and on-field/clinical settings. AI algorithms 
      primarily utilized electromyography and joint angle information as input data. 
      Support vector machine was the most used supervised learning algorithm (18.64%), 
      while artificial neural network demonstrated the highest accuracy in eight 
      studies. INTERPRETATIONS: The potential for remote patient monitoring is evident 
      with the adoption of field-based devices. Nevertheless, AI-based sensors are 
      underutilized in detecting ankle motions at risk of sprain. We identify three key 
      challenges: sensor designs, the controllability of AI models, and the integration 
      of AI-sensor models, providing valuable insights for future research.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence Techniques for the Non-invasive Detection of COVID-19 
      Through the Analysis of Voice Signals.
PG  - 1-11
LID - 10.1007/s13369-021-06041-4 [doi]
AB  - Healthcare sensors represent a valid and non-invasive instrument to capture and 
      analyse physiological data. Several vital signals, such as voice signals, can be 
      acquired anytime and anywhere, achieved with the least possible discomfort to the 
      patient thanks to the development of increasingly advanced devices. The 
      integration of sensors with artificial intelligence techniques contributes to the 
      realization of faster and easier solutions aimed at improving early diagnosis, 
      personalized treatment, remote patient monitoring and better decision making, all 
      tasks vital in a critical situation such as that of the COVID-19 pandemic. This 
      paper presents a study about the possibility to support the early and 
      non-invasive detection of COVID-19 through the analysis of voice signals by means 
      of the main machine learning algorithms. If demonstrated, this detection capacity 
      could be embedded in a powerful mobile screening application. To perform this 
      important study, the Coswara dataset is considered. The aim of this investigation 
      is not only to evaluate which machine learning technique best distinguishes a 
      healthy voice from a pathological one, but also to identify which vowel sound is 
      most seriously affected by COVID-19 and is, therefore, most reliable in detecting 
      the pathology. The results show that Random Forest is the technique that 
      classifies most accurately healthy and pathological voices. Moreover, the 
      evaluation of the vowel /e/ allows the detection of the effects of COVID-19 on 
      voice quality with a better accuracy than the other vowels.

AB  - Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) and embedded systems have improved the 
      healthcare systems by enabling remote monitoring the patients' health conditions 
      anywhere and anytime especially during novel COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper, an 
      IoT-based predicting model is proposed to predict colorectal cancer (CRC) in 
      elderlies. It provides a CRC predicting model for the involved medical team to 
      continuously trace an elderly's biological indicators using smart wearable 
      embedded systems and medical IoT devices. In this model, vital medical data is 
      collected by IoMT devices and sensors, then analytical information is derived via 
      machine learning (ML) methods for early CRC diagnosis and elderly's health 
      parameters changes. The experimental results confirm that the suggested model 
      meets the proper accuracy of predicting the CRC in aged people.

TI  - A comprehensive health assessment approach using ensemble deep learning model for 
      remote patient monitoring with IoT.
PG  - 15661
LID - 10.1038/s41598-024-66427-w [doi]
LID - 15661
AB  - The goal of this research is to create an ensemble deep learning model for 
      Internet of Things (IoT) applications that specifically target remote patient 
      monitoring (RPM) by integrating long short-term memory (LSTM) networks and 
      convolutional neural networks (CNN). The work tackles important RPM concerns such 
      early health issue diagnosis and accurate real-time physiological data collection 
      and analysis using wearable IoT devices. By assessing important health factors 
      like heart rate, blood pressure, pulse, temperature, activity level, weight 
      management, respiration rate, medication adherence, sleep patterns, and oxygen 
      levels, the suggested Remote Patient Monitor Model (RPMM) attains a noteworthy 
      accuracy of 97.23%. The model's capacity to identify spatial and temporal 
      relationships in health data is improved by novel techniques such as the use of 
      CNN for spatial analysis and feature extraction and LSTM for temporal sequence 
      modeling. Early intervention is made easier by this synergistic approach, which 
      enhances trend identification and anomaly detection in vital signs. A variety of 
      datasets are used to validate the model's robustness, highlighting its efficacy 
      in remote patient care. This study shows how using ensemble models' advantages 
      might improve health monitoring's precision and promptness, which would 
      eventually benefit patients and ease the burden on healthcare systems.

TI  - Intelligent IoT (IIoT) Device to Identifying Suspected COVID-19 Infections Using 
      Sensor Fusion Algorithm and Real-Time Mask Detection Based on the Enhanced 
      MobileNetV2 Model.
LID - 10.3390/healthcare10030454 [doi]
LID - 454
AB  - This paper employs a unique sensor fusion (SF) approach to detect a COVID-19 
      suspect and the enhanced MobileNetV2 model is used for face mask detection on an 
      Internet-of-Things (IoT) platform. The SF algorithm avoids incorrect predictions 
      of the suspect. Health data are continuously monitored and recorded on the 
      ThingSpeak cloud server. When a COVID-19 suspect is detected, an emergency email 
      is sent to healthcare personnel with the GPS position of the suspect. A 
      lightweight and fast deep learning model is used to recognize appropriate mask 
      positioning; this restricts virus transmission. When tested with the real-world 
      masked face dataset (RMFD) dataset, the enhanced MobileNetV2 neural network is 
      optimal for Raspberry Pi. Our IoT device and deep learning model are 98.50% 
      (compared to commercial devices) and 99.26% accurate, respectively, and the time 
      required for face mask evaluation is 31.1 milliseconds. The proposed device is 
      useful for remote monitoring of covid patients. Thus, the method will find 
      medical application in the detection of COVID-19-positive patients. The device is 
      also wearable.

TI  - Nonlinear Features from Multi-Modal Signals for Continuous Stress Monitoring.
PG  - 1-4
LID - 10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10340715 [doi]
AB  - Continuous monitoring of stress in individuals during their daily activities has 
      become an inevitable need in present times. Unattended stress is a silent killer 
      and may lead to fatal physical and mental disorders if left unidentified. Stress 
      identification based on individual judgement often leads to under-diagnosis and 
      delayed treatment possibilities. EEG-based stress monitoring is quite popular in 
      this context, but impractical to use for continuous remote monitoring.Continuous 
      remote monitoring of stress using signals acquired from everyday wearables like 
      smart watches is the best alternative here. Non-EEG data such as heart rate and 
      ectodermal activity can also act as indicators of physiological stress. In this 
      work, we have explored the possibility of using nonlinear features from non-EEG 
      data such as (a) heart rate, (b) ectodermal activity, (c) body temperature (d) 
      SpO2 and (e) acceleration in detecting four different types of neurological 
      states; namely (1) Relaxed state, (2) State of Physical stress, (3) State of 
      Cognitive stress and (4) State of Emotional stress. Physiological data of 20 
      healthy adults have been used from the noneeg database of PhysioNet.Results: We 
      used two machine learning models; a linear logistic regression and a nonlinear 
      random forest to detect (a) stress from relaxed state and (4) the four different 
      neurological states. We trained the models using linear and nonlinear features 
      separately. For the 2-class and 4-class problems, using nonlinear features 
      increased the accuracy of the models. Moreover, it is also proved in this study 
      that by using nonlinear features, we can avoid the use of complex machine 
      learning models.

AB  - (1) Background: We present the protocol of a randomized controlled trial designed 
      to evaluate the benefit of a novel clinical decision support system for the 
      management of patients with COVID-19. (2) Methods: The study will recruit up to 
      500 participants (250 cases and 250 controls). Both groups will receive the 
      conventional telephone follow-up protocol by primary care and will also be 
      provided with access to a mobile application, in which they will be able to 
      report their symptoms three times a day. In addition, patients in the active 
      group will receive a wearable smartwatch and a pulse oximeter at home for 
      real-time monitoring. The measured data will be visualized by primary care and 
      emergency health service professionals, allowing them to detect in real time the 
      progression and complications of the disease in order to promote early 
      therapeutic interventions based on their clinical judgement. (3) Results: Ethical 
      approval for this study was obtained from the Drug Research Ethics Committee of 
      the Valladolid East Health Area (CASVE-NM-21-516). The results obtained from this 
      study will form part of the thesis of two PhD students and will be disseminated 
      through publication in a peer-reviewed journal. (4) Conclusions: The 
      implementation of this telemonitoring system can be extrapolated to patients with 
      other similar diseases, such as chronic diseases, with a high prevalence and need 
      for close monitoring.

TI  - Automated Detection of In-Home Activities with Ultra-Wideband Sensors.
LID - 10.3390/s24144706 [doi]
LID - 4706
AB  - As Canada's population of older adults rises, the need for aging-in-place 
      solutions is growing due to the declining quality of long-term-care homes and 
      long wait times. While the current standards include questionnaire-based 
      assessments for monitoring activities of daily living (ADLs), there is an urgent 
      need for advanced indoor localization technologies that ensure privacy. This 
      study explores the use of Ultra-Wideband (UWB) technology for activity 
      recognition in a mock condo in the Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital. UWB systems 
      with built-in Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors were tested, using anchors 
      set up across the condo and a tag worn by patients. We tested various UWB setups, 
      changed the number of anchors, and varied the tag placement (on the wrist or 
      chest). Wrist-worn tags consistently outperformed chest-worn tags, and the 
      nine-anchor configuration yielded the highest accuracy. Machine learning models 
      were developed to classify activities based on UWB and IMU data. Models that 
      included positional data significantly outperformed those that did not. The 
      Random Forest model with a 4 s data window achieved an accuracy of 94%, compared 
      to 79.2% when positional data were excluded. These findings demonstrate that 
      incorporating positional data with IMU sensors is a promising method for 
      effective remote patient monitoring.

TI  - Highly Stretchable and Robust Electrochemical Sensor Based on 3D Graphene 
      Oxide-CNT Composite for Detecting Ammonium in Sweat.
LID - 10.3390/bios13030409 [doi]
LID - 409
AB  - Wearable electrochemical sensors have attracted tremendous attention and have 
      been experiencing rapid growth in recent years. Sweat, one of the most suitable 
      biological fluids for non-invasive monitoring, contains various chemical elements 
      relating abundant information about human health conditions. In this work, a new 
      type of non-invasive and highly stretchable potentiometric sweat sensor was 
      developed based on all-solid-state ion-selective electrode (ISE) coupled with 
      poly(dimethylsiloxane; PDMS) and polyurethane (PU). This highly stretchable 
      composite of PDMS-PU allows the sensor to be robust, with the PDMS providing a 
      flexible backbone and the PU enhancing the adhesion between the electrodes and 
      the substrate. In addition, graphene-carbon nanotube (CNT) network 3D 
      nanomaterials were introduced to modify the ion selective membrane (ISM) in order 
      to increase the charge transfer activity of the ISEs, which also could minimize 
      the formation of water layers on the electrode surface, as such nanomaterials are 
      highly hydrophobic. As a result, the sensor demonstrated a wide detection range 
      of NH(4)(+) from 10(-6) M to 10(-1) M with high stability and sensitivity-showing 
      a high sensitivity of 59.6 ± 1.5 mV/log [NH(4)(+)] and an LOD lower than 10(-6) 
      M. Under a strain of 40%, the sensor still showed a sensitivity of 42.7 ± 3.1 
      mV/log [NH(4)(+)]. The proposed highly stretchable and robust electrochemical 
      sweat sensor provides a new choice for wearable-device-based personal daily 
      healthcare management beyond hospital-centric healthcare monitoring.

TI  - Automatic Grading of Stroke Symptoms for Rapid Assessment Using Optimized Machine 
      Learning and 4-Limb Kinematics: Clinical Validation Study.
PG  - e20641
LID - 10.2196/20641 [doi]
LID - e20641
AB  - BACKGROUND: Subtle abnormal motor signs are indications of serious neurological 
      diseases. Although neurological deficits require fast initiation of treatment in 
      a restricted time, it is difficult for nonspecialists to detect and objectively 
      assess the symptoms. In the clinical environment, diagnoses and decisions are 
      based on clinical grading methods, including the National Institutes of Health 
      Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score or the Medical Research Council (MRC) score, which 
      have been used to measure motor weakness. Objective grading in various 
      environments is necessitated for consistent agreement among patients, caregivers, 
      paramedics, and medical staff to facilitate rapid diagnoses and dispatches to 
      appropriate medical centers. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to develop an 
      autonomous grading system for stroke patients. We investigated the feasibility of 
      our new system to assess motor weakness and grade NIHSS and MRC scores of 4 
      limbs, similar to the clinical examinations performed by medical staff. METHODS: 
      We implemented an automatic grading system composed of a measuring unit with 
      wearable sensors and a grading unit with optimized machine learning. Inertial 
      sensors were attached to measure subtle weaknesses caused by paralysis of upper 
      and lower limbs. We collected 60 instances of data with kinematic features of 
      motor disorders from neurological examination and demographic information of 
      stroke patients with NIHSS 0 or 1 and MRC 7, 8, or 9 grades in a stroke unit. 
      Training data with 240 instances were generated using a synthetic minority 
      oversampling technique to complement the imbalanced number of data between 
      classes and low number of training data. We trained 2 representative machine 
      learning algorithms, an ensemble and a support vector machine (SVM), to implement 
      auto-NIHSS and auto-MRC grading. The optimized algorithms performed a 5-fold 
      cross-validation and were searched by Bayes optimization in 30 trials. The 
      trained model was tested with the 60 original hold-out instances for performance 
      evaluation in accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver 
      operating characteristics curve (AUC). RESULTS: The proposed system can grade 
      NIHSS scores with an accuracy of 83.3% and an AUC of 0.912 using an optimized 
      ensemble algorithm, and it can grade with an accuracy of 80.0% and an AUC of 
      0.860 using an optimized SVM algorithm. The auto-MRC grading achieved an accuracy 
      of 76.7% and a mean AUC of 0.870 in SVM classification and an accuracy of 78.3% 
      and a mean AUC of 0.877 in ensemble classification. CONCLUSIONS: The automatic 
      grading system quantifies proximal weakness in real time and assesses symptoms 
      through automatic grading. The pilot outcomes demonstrated the feasibility of 
      remote monitoring of motor weakness caused by stroke. The system can facilitate 
      consistent grading with instant assessment and expedite dispatches to appropriate 
      hospitals and treatment initiation by sharing auto-MRC and auto-NIHSS scores 
      between prehospital and hospital responses as an objective observation.

TI  - MyoNet: A Transfer-Learning-Based LRCN for Lower Limb Movement Recognition and 
      Knee Joint Angle Prediction for Remote Monitoring of Rehabilitation Progress From 
      sEMG.

AB  - The clinical assessment technology such as remote monitoring of rehabilitation 
      progress for lower limb related ailments rely on the automatic evaluation of 
      movement performed along with an estimation of joint angle information. In this 
      paper, we introduce a transfer-learning based Long-term Recurrent Convolution 
      Network (LRCN) named as 'MyoNet' for the classification of lower limb movements, 
      along with the prediction of the corresponding knee joint angle. The model 
      consists of three blocks- (i) feature extractor block, (ii) joint angle 
      prediction block, and (iii) movement classification block. Initially, the model 
      is end-to-end trained for knee joint angle prediction followed by transferring 
      the knowledge of a trained model to the movement classification through 
      transfer-learning approach making a memory and computationally efficient design. 
      The proposed MyoNet was evaluated on publicly available University of California 
      (UC) Irvine machine learning repository dataset of the lower limb for 11 healthy 
      subjects and 11 subjects with knee pathology for three movements type-walking, 
      standing with knee flexion movements and sitting with knee extension movements. 
      The average mean absolute error (MAE) resulted in the prediction of joint angle 
      for healthy subjects and subjects with knee pathology are 8.1 % and 9.2 % 
      respectively. Subsequently, an average classification accuracy of 98.1 % and 92.4 
      % were achieved for healthy subjects and subjects with knee pathology, 
      respectively. Interestingly, the significance of this study in itself is 
      promising with substantial improvement in the performance compared to 
      state-of-the-art methodologies. The clinical significance of such surface 
      electromyography signals (sEMG) based movement recognition and prediction of 
      corresponding joint angle system could be beneficial for remote monitoring of 
      rehabilitation progress by the physiotherapist using wearables.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Autonomic Dysreflexia (AD) is a potentially life-threatening syndrome 
      which occurs in individuals with higher level spinal cord injuries (SCI). AD is 
      caused by triggers which can lead to rapid escalation of pathophysiological 
      responses and if the trigger is not removed, AD can be fatal. There is currently 
      no objective, non-invasive and accurate monitoring system available to 
      automatically detect the onset of AD symptoms in real time in a non-clinical 
      setting. Technology or Method: We developed a user-independent method of 
      symptomatic AD detection in real time with a wearable physiological telemetry 
      system (PTS) and a machine learning model using data from eleven participants 
      with SCI. RESULTS: The PTS could detect onset of AD symptoms with an average 
      accuracy of 94.10% and a false negative rate of 4.89%. CONCLUSIONS: The PTS can 
      detect the onset of the symptoms AD with high sensitivity and specificity to 
      assist people with SCIs in preventing the occurrence of AD. It would enable 
      persons with high level SCIs to be more independent and pursue vocational 
      activities while granting continuous medical oversight. Clinical Impact: The PTS 
      could serve as a supplementary tool to current solutions to detect the onset of 
      AD and prepare individuals who are newly injured to be better prepared for AD 
      episodes. Moreover, it could be translated into a system to encourage individuals 
      to practice better healthcare management to prevent future occurrences.

LID - 10.3233/SHTI230454 [doi]
AB  - The real-time revolutions per minute (RPM) data, ECG signal, pulse rate, and 
      oxygen saturation levels were collected during 16-minute cycling exercises. In 
      parallel, ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) were collected each minute from the 
      study participants. A 2-minute moving window, with one minute shift, was applied 
      to each 16-minute exercise session to divide it into a total of fifteen 2-minute 
      windows. Based on the self-reported RPE, each exercise window was labeled as 
      "high exertion" or "low exertion" classes. The heart rate variability (HRV) 
      characteristics in time and frequency domains were extracted from the collected 
      ECG signals for each window. In addition, collected oxygen saturation levels, 
      pulse rate, and RPMs were averaged for each window. The best predictive features 
      were then selected using the minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) 
      algorithm. Top selected features were then used to assess the accuracy of five ML 
      classifiers to predict the level of exertion. The Naïve Bayes model demonstrated 
      the best performance with an accuracy of 80% and an F1 score of 79%.

TI  - Remote Short Sessions of Heart Rate Variability Biofeedback Monitored With 
      Wearable Technology: Open-Label Prospective Feasibility Study.
PG  - e55552
LID - 10.2196/55552 [doi]
LID - e55552
AB  - BACKGROUND: Heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback is often performed with 
      structured education, laboratory-based assessments, and practice sessions. It has 
      been shown to improve psychological and physiological function across 
      populations. However, a means to remotely use and monitor this approach would 
      allow for wider use of this technique. Advancements in wearable and digital 
      technology present an opportunity for the widespread application of this 
      approach. OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of the study was to determine the 
      feasibility of fully remote, self-administered short sessions of HRV-directed 
      biofeedback in a diverse population of health care workers (HCWs). The secondary 
      aim was to determine whether a fully remote, HRV-directed biofeedback 
      intervention significantly alters longitudinal HRV over the intervention period, 
      as monitored by wearable devices. The tertiary aim was to estimate the impact of 
      this intervention on metrics of psychological well-being. METHODS: To determine 
      whether remotely implemented short sessions of HRV biofeedback can improve 
      autonomic metrics and psychological well-being, we enrolled HCWs across 7 
      hospitals in New York City in the United States. They downloaded our study app, 
      watched brief educational videos about HRV biofeedback, and used a well-studied 
      HRV biofeedback program remotely through their smartphone. HRV biofeedback 
      sessions were used for 5 minutes per day for 5 weeks. HCWs were then followed for 
      12 weeks after the intervention period. Psychological measures were obtained over 
      the study period, and they wore an Apple Watch for at least 7 weeks to monitor 
      the circadian features of HRV. RESULTS: In total, 127 HCWs were enrolled in the 
      study. Overall, only 21 (16.5%) were at least 50% compliant with the HRV 
      biofeedback intervention, representing a small portion of the total sample. This 
      demonstrates that this study design does not feasibly result in adequate rates of 
      compliance with the intervention. Numerical improvement in psychological metrics 
      was observed over the 17-week study period, although it did not reach statistical 
      significance (all P>.05). Using a mixed effect cosinor model, the mean 
      midline-estimating statistic of rhythm (MESOR) of the circadian pattern of the SD 
      of the interbeat interval of normal sinus beats (SDNN), an HRV metric, was 
      observed to increase over the first 4 weeks of the biofeedback intervention in 
      HCWs who were at least 50% compliant. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we found that 
      using brief remote HRV biofeedback sessions and monitoring its physiological 
      effect using wearable devices, in the manner that the study was conducted, was 
      not feasible. This is considering the low compliance rates with the study 
      intervention. We found that remote short sessions of HRV biofeedback demonstrate 
      potential promise in improving autonomic nervous function and warrant further 
      study. Wearable devices can monitor the physiological effects of psychological 
      interventions.

TI  - Towards blockchain based federated learning in categorizing healthcare monitoring 
      devices on artificial intelligence of medical things investigative framework.
PG  - 105
LID - 10.1186/s12880-024-01279-4 [doi]
AB  - Categorizing Artificial Intelligence of Medical Things (AIoMT) devices within the 
      realm of standard Internet of Things (IoT) and Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) 
      devices, particularly at the server and computational layers, poses a formidable 
      challenge. In this paper, we present a novel methodology for categorizing AIoMT 
      devices through the application of decentralized processing, referred to as 
      "Federated Learning" (FL). Our approach involves deploying a system on standard 
      IoT devices and labeled IoMT devices for training purposes and attribute 
      extraction. Through this process, we extract and map the interconnected 
      attributes from a global federated cum aggression server. The aim of this 
      terminology is to extract interdependent devices via federated learning, ensuring 
      data privacy and adherence to operational policies. Consequently, a global 
      training dataset repository is coordinated to establish a centralized indexing 
      and synchronization knowledge repository. The categorization process employs 
      generic labels for devices transmitting medical data through regular 
      communication channels. We evaluate our proposed methodology across a variety of 
      IoT, IoMT, and AIoMT devices, demonstrating effective classification and 
      labeling. Our technique yields a reliable categorization index for facilitating 
      efficient access and optimization of medical devices within global servers.

TI  - Personalized Metabolic Avatar: A Data Driven Model of Metabolism for Weight 
      Variation Forecasting and Diet Plan Evaluation.
LID - 10.3390/nu14173520 [doi]
LID - 3520
AB  - Development of predictive computational models of metabolism through mechanistic 
      models is complex and resource demanding, and their personalization remains 
      challenging. Data-driven models of human metabolism would constitute a reliable, 
      fast, and continuously updating model for predictive analytics. Wearable devices, 
      such as smart bands and impedance balances, allow the real time and remote 
      monitoring of physiological parameters, providing for a flux of data carrying 
      information on user metabolism. Here, we developed a data-driven model of 
      end-user metabolism, the Personalized Metabolic Avatar (PMA), to estimate its 
      personalized reactions to diets. PMA consists of a gated recurrent unit (GRU) 
      deep learning model trained to forecast personalized weight variations according 
      to macronutrient composition and daily energy balance. The model can perform 
      simulations and evaluation of diet plans, allowing the definition of tailored 
      goals for achieving ideal weight. This approach can provide the correct clues to 
      empower citizens with scientific knowledge, augmenting their self-awareness with 
      the aim to achieve long-lasting results in pursuing a healthy lifestyle.

TI  - Assessing Free-Living Postural Sway in Persons With Multiple Sclerosis.
PG  - 967-973
LID - 10.1109/TNSRE.2024.3366903 [doi]
AB  - Postural instability is associated with disease status and fall risk in Persons 
      with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS). However, assessments of postural instability, 
      known as postural sway, leverage force platforms or wearable accelerometers, and 
      are most often conducted in laboratory environments and are thus not broadly 
      accessible. Remote measures of postural sway captured during daily life may 
      provide a more accessible alterative, but their ability to capture disease status 
      and fall risk has not yet been established. We explored the utility of remote 
      measures of postural sway in a sample of 33 PwMS. Remote measures of sway 
      differed significantly from lab-based measures, but still demonstrated moderately 
      strong associations with patient-reported measures of balance and mobility 
      impairment. Machine learning models for predicting fall risk trained on lab data 
      provided an Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.79, while remote data only achieved an 
      AUC of 0.51. Remote model performance improved to an AUC of 0.74 after a new, 
      subject-specific k-means clustering approach was applied for identifying the 
      remote data most appropriate for modelling. This cluster-based approach for 
      analyzing remote data also strengthened associations with patient-reported 
      measures, increasing their strength above those observed in the lab. This work 
      introduces a new framework for analyzing data from remote patient monitoring 
      technologies and demonstrates the promise of remote postural sway assessment for 
      assessing fall risk and characterizing balance impairment in PwMS.

TI  - An Intelligent Sensor Based Decision Support System for Diagnosing Pulmonary 
      Ailment through Standardized Chest X-ray Scans.
LID - 10.3390/s22197474 [doi]
LID - 7474
AB  - Academics and the health community are paying much attention to developing smart 
      remote patient monitoring, sensors, and healthcare technology. For the analysis 
      of medical scans, various studies integrate sophisticated deep learning 
      strategies. A smart monitoring system is needed as a proactive diagnostic 
      solution that may be employed in an epidemiological scenario such as COVID-19. 
      Consequently, this work offers an intelligent medicare system that is an 
      IoT-empowered, deep learning-based decision support system (DSS) for the 
      automated detection and categorization of infectious diseases (COVID-19 and 
      pneumothorax). The proposed DSS system was evaluated using three independent 
      standard-based chest X-ray scans. The suggested DSS predictor has been used to 
      identify and classify areas on whole X-ray scans with abnormalities thought to be 
      attributable to COVID-19, reaching an identification and classification accuracy 
      rate of 89.58% for normal images and 89.13% for COVID-19 and pneumothorax. With 
      the suggested DSS system, a judgment depending on individual chest X-ray scans 
      may be made in approximately 0.01 s. As a result, the DSS system described in 
      this study can forecast at a pace of 95 frames per second (FPS) for both models, 
      which is near to real-time.

AB  - Electrocardiograms (ECGs) provide crucial information for evaluating a patient's 
      cardiovascular health; however, they are not always easily accessible. 
      Photoplethysmography (PPG), a technology commonly used in wearable devices such 
      as smartwatches, has shown promise for constructing ECGs. Several methods have 
      been proposed for ECG reconstruction using PPG signals, but some require signal 
      alignment during the training phase, which is not feasible in real-life settings 
      where ECG signals are not collected at the same time as PPG signals. To address 
      this challenge, we introduce PPG2ECGps, an end-to-end, patient-specific 
      deep-learning neural network utilizing the W-Net architecture. This novel 
      approach enables direct ECG signal reconstruction from PPG signals, eliminating 
      the need for signal alignment. Our experiments show that the proposed model 
      achieves mean values of 0.977 mV for Pearson's correlation coefficient, 0.037 mV 
      for the root mean square error, and 0.010 mV for the normalized dynamic 
      time-warped distance when comparing reconstructed ECGs to reference ECGs from a 
      dataset of 500 records. As PPG signals are more accessible than ECG signals, our 
      proposed model has significant potential to improve patient monitoring and 
      diagnosis in healthcare settings via wearable devices.

AB  - Joint angle quantification from inertial measurement units (IMUs) is commonly 
      performed using kinematic modelling, which depends on anatomical sensor placement 
      and/or functional joint calibration; however, accurate three-dimensional joint 
      motion measurement remains challenging to achieve. The aims of this study were 
      firstly to employ deep neural networks to convert IMU data to ankle joint angles 
      that are indistinguishable from those derived from motion capture-based inverse 
      kinematics (IK) - the reference standard; and secondly, to validate the 
      robustness of this approach across contrasting walking speeds in healthy 
      individuals. Kinematics data were simultaneously calculated using IMUs and IK 
      from 9 subjects during walking on a treadmill at 0.5 m/s, 1.0 m/s and 1.5 m/s. A 
      generative adversarial network was trained using gait data at two of the walking 
      speeds to predict ankle kinematics from IMU data alone for the third walking 
      speed. There were significant differences between IK and IMU joint angle 
      predictions for ankle eversion and internal rotation during walking at 0.5 m/s 
      and 1.0 m/s (p < 0.001); however, no significant differences in joint angles were 
      observed between the generative adversarial network prediction and IK at any 
      speed or plane of joint motion (p < 0.05). The RMS difference in ankle joint 
      kinematics between the generative adversarial network and IK for walking at 
      1.0 m/s was 3.8°, 2.1° and 3.5° for dorsiflexion, inversion and axial rotation, 
      respectively. The modeling approach presented for real-time IMU to ankle joint 
      angle conversion, which can be readily expanded to other joints, may provide 
      enhanced IMU capability in applications such as telemedicine, remote monitoring 
      and rehabilitation.

AB  - Soft and stretchable electronics have garnered significant attention in various 
      fields, such as wearable electronics, electronic skins, and soft robotics. 
      However, current wearable electronics made from materials like conductive 
      elastomers, hydrogels, and liquid metals face limitations, including low 
      permeability, poor adhesion, inadequate conductivity, and limited stretchability. 
      These issues hinder their effectiveness in long-term healthcare monitoring and 
      exercise monitoring. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel design of 
      web-droplet-like electronics featuring a semi-liquid metal coating for wearable 
      applications. This innovative design offers high permeability, excellent 
      stretchability, strong adhesion, and good conductivity for the electronic skin. 
      The unique structure, inspired by the architecture of a spider web, significantly 
      enhances air permeability compared to commercial breathable patches. Furthermore, 
      the distribution of polyborosiloxane mimics the adhesive properties of spider web 
      mucus, while the use of semi-liquid metals in this design results in remarkable 
      conductivity (9 × 10(6) S/m) and tensile performance (up to 850% strain). This 
      advanced electronic skin technology enables long-term monitoring of various 
      physiological parameters and supports machine learning recognition functions with 
      unparalleled advantages. This web-droplet structure design strategy holds great 
      promise for commercial applications in medical health monitoring and disease 
      diagnosis.

AB  - Coronary artery disease (CAD), an acute and life-threatening cardiovascular 
      disease, is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Coronary 
      angiography, the principal diagnostic tool for CAD, is invasive, expensive, and 
      requires a lot of skilled effort. The current study aims to develop an automated 
      and non-invasive CAD detection model and improve its performance as closely as 
      possible to clinically acceptable diagnostic sensitivity. Electrocardiogram (ECG) 
      characteristics are observed to be altered due to CAD and can be studied to 
      develop a screening tool for its detection. The subject's clinical information 
      can help broadly identify the high-cardiac-risk population and serve as a primary 
      step in diagnosing CAD. This paper presents an approach to automatically detect 
      CAD based on clinical data, morphological ECG features, and heart rate 
      variability (HRV) features extracted from short-duration Lead-II ECG recordings. 
      A few popular machine-learning classifiers, including support vector machine 
      (SVM), random forest (RF), K-nearest neighbours (KNN), Gaussian Naïve Bayes 
      (GNB), and multi-layer perceptron (MLP), are trained on the extracted feature 
      space, and their performance is evaluated. Classifiers built by integrating 
      clinical data and features extracted from ECG recordings demonstrated better 
      performance than those built on each feature set separately, and the RF 
      classifier outperforms other considered machine learners and reports an average 
      testing accuracy of 94% and a G-mean score of 92% with a 5-fold cross-validation 
      training accuracy of 95(± 0.04)%.Clinical relevance- The proposed method uses a 
      brief, single-lead ECG recording and performs similarly to current clinical 
      practices in an explainable manner. This makes it suitable for deployment via 
      wearable technology (like smart watch gadgets) and telemonitoring, which may 
      facilitate an earlier and more widespread CAD diagnosis.

AB  - The frequency and severity of Mediterranean forest fires are expected to worsen 
      as climate change progresses, heightening the need to evaluate understory fuel 
      management strategies as rigorously as possible. Prescribed small-ruminant 
      foraging is considered a sustainable, cost-effective strategy, but demonstrating 
      a link between animal presence and vegetation change is challenging. This study 
      tested whether the effect of small-ruminant herd presence in Mediterranean 
      woodlands can be detected by integrating remote sensing and herd tracking at the 
      landscape scale. The daily foraging routes of seven shepherded goat herds that 
      exploited a 100-km(2) forested area of the Judean Hills, Israel, were tracked 
      over six years using GPS (Global Positioning System) collars. Herd locations were 
      converted to stocking rates, with units of animal-presence-days per unit area per 
      defined time period, and mapped at a spatial resolution of 10 m. We estimated 
      pixel-level vegetation cover change based on a time series of 63 monthly 
      Landsat-8 images expressed as the normalized soil-adjusted vegetation index 
      (SAVI). Spatiotemporal trend analysis assessed the magnitude and direction of 
      change, and a random forest machine-learning algorithm estimated the relative 
      impact on vegetation cover change of environmental factors as well as the 
      herd-related factors of stocking rate that accrued over six years and distance to 
      the closest corral. The last two factors were among the most influential factors 
      determining vegetation cover change in the regional and individual-herd analyses. 
      In some respects, the permanent herds differed in their spatial pattern of 
      stocking rate from the mobile herds that periodically relocated their night 
      corral throughout the year, but stocking rate scaled logarithmically for all 
      herds individually and combined. The combination of multi-season GPS tracking, 
      remote sensing, and machine-learning techniques, applied at a regional scale, 
      detected herd impacts on vegetation cover trends, consistent with livestock 
      foraging being an effective tool for fuel reduction in Mediterranean woodlands.

AB  - Introduction: Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) has emerged as a 
      powerful tool for rapid pathogen identification in clinical practice. However, 
      the parameters used to interpret mNGS data, such as read count, genus rank, and 
      coverage, lack explicit performance evaluation. In this study, the developed 
      indicators as well as novel parameters were assessed for their performance in 
      bacterium detection. Methods: We developed several relevant parameters, including 
      10M normalized reads, double-discard reads, Genus Rank Ratio, King Genus Rank 
      Ratio, Genus Rank Ratio*Genus Rank, and King Genus Rank Ratio*Genus Rank. These 
      parameters, together with frequently used read indicators including raw reads, 
      reads per million mapped reads (RPM), transcript per kilobase per million mapped 
      reads (TPM), Genus Rank, and coverage were analyzed for their diagnostic 
      efficiency in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), a common source for detecting 
      eight bacterium pathogens: Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, 
      Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Hemophilus influenzae, 
      Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Aspergillus fumigatus. 
      Results: The results demonstrated that these indicators exhibited good diagnostic 
      efficacy for the eight pathogens. The AUC values of all indicators were almost 
      greater than 0.9, and the corresponding sensitivity and specificity values were 
      almost greater than 0.8, excepted coverage. The negative predictive value of all 
      indicators was greater than 0.9. The results showed that the use of 
      double-discarded reads, Genus Rank Ratio*Genus Rank, and King Genus Rank 
      Ratio*Genus Rank exhibited better diagnostic efficiency than that of raw reads, 
      RPM, TPM, and in Genus Rank. These parameters can serve as a reference for 
      interpreting mNGS data of BALF. Moreover, precision filters integrating our novel 
      parameters were built to detect the eight bacterium pathogens in BALF samples 
      through machine learning. Summary: In this study, we developed a set of novel 
      parameters for pathogen identification in clinical mNGS based on reads and 
      ranking. These parameters were found to be more effective in diagnosing pathogens 
      than traditional approaches. The findings provide valuable insights for improving 
      the interpretation of mNGS reports in clinical settings, specifically in BALF 
      analysis.

TI  - Development of a Machine Learning Model for Survival Risk Stratification of 
      Patients With Advanced Oral Cancer.
PG  - e2011768
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.11768 [doi]
LID - e2011768
AB  - IMPORTANCE: A tool for precisely stratifying postoperative patients with advanced 
      oral cancer is crucial for the treatment plan, such as intensifying or 
      deintensifying the regimen to improve their quality of life and prognosis. 
      OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a machine learning-based algorithm that can 
      provide survival risk stratification for patients with advanced oral cancer who 
      have comprehensive clinicopathologic and genetic data. DESIGN, SETTING, AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: In this prognostic cohort study, the elastic net penalized Cox 
      proportional hazards regression-based risk stratification model was developed and 
      validated using single-center data collected between January 1, 1996, and 
      December 31, 2011. In total, comprehensive clinicopathologic and genetic data 
      (including clinical, pathologic, and 44 cancer-related gene variant profiles) of 
      334 patients with stage III or IV oral squamous cell carcinoma were used to 
      develop and validate the algorithm in this 15-year cohort study. Data analysis 
      was conducted between February 1, 2018, and May 6, 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND 
      MEASURES: The main outcomes were cancer-specific survival, distant 
      metastasis-free survival, and locoregional recurrence-free survival. Model 
      performance was compared in terms of the Akaike information criterion and the 
      Harrell concordance index (C index). RESULTS: Complete data were available for 
      334 patients (315 men; median age at onset, 48 years [interquartile range, 42-56 
      years]). The predictive models using comprehensive clinicopathologic and genetic 
      data outperformed those using clinicopathologic data alone. In the groups of 
      postoperative patients receiving adjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy, the 
      models demonstrated higher classification performance than those using 
      clinicopathologic data alone in cancer-specific survival (mean [SD] C index, 
      0.689 [0.050] vs 0.673 [0.051]; P = .02) and locoregional recurrence-free 
      survival (mean [SD] C index, 0.693 [0.039] vs 0.678 [0.035]; P = .004). The 
      classification performance in distant metastasis-free survival was not different 
      (mean [SD] C index, 0.702 [0.056] vs 0.688 [0.048]; P = .09). CONCLUSIONS AND 
      RELEVANCE: A risk stratification model using comprehensive clinicopathologic and 
      genetic data accurately differentiated the high-risk group from the low-risk 
      group in cancer-specific survival and locoregional recurrence-free survival for 
      postoperative patients with advanced oral cancer. This algorithm could be used 
      through an online calculator to provide additional personalized information for 
      postoperative management of patients with advanced oral squamous cell carcinoma.

TI  - Open-source dataset reveals relationship between walking bout duration and fall 
      risk classification performance in persons with multiple sclerosis.
PG  - e0000120

LID - e0000120
AB  - Falls are frequent and associated with morbidity in persons with multiple 
      sclerosis (PwMS). Symptoms of MS fluctuate, and standard biannual clinical visits 
      cannot capture these fluctuations. Remote monitoring techniques that leverage 
      wearable sensors have recently emerged as an approach sensitive to disease 
      variability. Previous research has shown that fall risk can be identified from 
      walking data collected by wearable sensors in controlled laboratory conditions 
      however this data may not be generalizable to variable home environments. To 
      investigate fall risk and daily activity performance from remote data, we 
      introduce a new open-source dataset featuring data collected from 38 PwMS, 21 of 
      whom are identified as fallers and 17 as non-fallers based on their six-month 
      fall history. This dataset contains inertial-measurement-unit data from eleven 
      body locations collected in the laboratory, patient-reported surveys and 
      neurological assessments, and two days of free-living sensor data from the chest 
      and right thigh. Six-month (n = 28) and one-year repeat assessment (n = 15) data 
      are also available for some patients. To demonstrate the utility of these data, 
      we explore the use of free-living walking bouts for characterizing fall risk in 
      PwMS, compare these data to those collected in controlled environments, and 
      examine the impact of bout duration on gait parameters and fall risk estimates. 
      Both gait parameters and fall risk classification performance were found to 
      change with bout duration. Deep learning models outperformed feature-based models 
      using home data; the best performance was observed with all bouts for 
      deep-learning and short bouts for feature-based models when evaluating 
      performance on individual bouts. Overall, short duration free-living walking 
      bouts were found to be the least similar to laboratory walking, longer duration 
      free-living walking bouts provided more significant differences between fallers 
      and non-fallers, and an aggregation of all free-living walking bouts yields the 
      best performance in fall risk classification.

TI  - Automated Arrhythmia Classification Using Farmland Fertility Algorithm with 
      Hybrid Deep Learning Model on Internet of Things Environment.
LID - 10.3390/s23198265 [doi]
LID - 8265
AB  - In recent years, the rapid progress of Internet of Things (IoT) solutions has 
      offered an immense opportunity for the collection and dissemination of health 
      records in a central data platform. Electrocardiogram (ECG), a fast, easy, and 
      non-invasive method, is generally employed in the evaluation of heart conditions 
      that lead to heart ailments and the identification of heart diseases. The 
      deployment of IoT devices for arrhythmia classification offers many benefits such 
      as remote patient care, continuous monitoring, and early recognition of abnormal 
      heart rhythms. However, it is challenging to diagnose and manually classify 
      arrhythmia as the manual diagnosis of ECG signals is a time-consuming process. 
      Therefore, the current article presents the automated arrhythmia classification 
      using the Farmland Fertility Algorithm with Hybrid Deep Learning (AAC-FFAHDL) 
      approach in the IoT platform. The proposed AAC-FFAHDL system exploits the 
      hyperparameter-tuned DL model for ECG signal analysis, thereby diagnosing 
      arrhythmia. In order to accomplish this, the AAC-FFAHDL technique initially 
      performs data pre-processing to scale the input signals into a uniform format. 
      Further, the AAC-FFAHDL technique uses the HDL approach for detection and 
      classification of arrhythmia. In order to improve the classification and 
      detection performance of the HDL approach, the AAC-FFAHDL technique involves an 
      FFA-based hyperparameter tuning process. The proposed AAC-FFAHDL approach was 
      validated through simulation using the benchmark ECG database. The comparative 
      experimental analysis outcomes confirmed that the AAC-FFAHDL system achieves 
      promising performance compared with other models under different evaluation 
      measures.

      glucose, and blood pressure. However, the ability to accurately detect falls and 
      monitor physical activity remotely without invading privacy or remembering to 
      wear a costly device remains an ongoing concern. Our proposed system utilizes a 
      millimeter-wave (mmwave) radar sensor (IWR6843ISK-ODS) connected to an NVIDIA 
      Jetson Nano board for continuous monitoring of human activity. We developed a 
      PointNet neural network for real-time human activity monitoring that can provide 
      activity data reports, tracking maps, and fall alerts. Using radar helps to 
      safeguard patients' privacy by abstaining from recording camera images. We 
      evaluated our system for real-time operation and achieved an inference accuracy 
      of 99.5% when recognizing five types of activities: standing, walking, sitting, 
      lying, and falling. Our system would facilitate the ability to detect falls and 
      monitor physical activity in home and institutional settings to improve 
      telemedicine by providing objective data for more timely and targeted 
      interventions. This work demonstrates the potential of artificial intelligence 
      algorithms and mmwave sensors for HAR.

AB  - Hospital-at-home has been gaining increased attention as a potential remedy for 
      the current shortcomings of our health care system, allowing for essential health 
      services to be provided to patients in the comfort of their own homes. The advent 
      of digital technology has revolutionized the way we provide medical and health 
      care, leading to the emergence of a “hospital without walls.” The rapid adoption 
      of novel digital health care technologies is revolutionizing remote health care 
      provision, effectively dismantling the conventional boundary separating hospitals 
      from the comfort of patients’ homes. The Guangdong Second Provincial General 
      Hospital has developed a 5G-powered Smart Home Ward (SHW) that extends medical 
      care services to the home setting and is tailored to meet the needs and settings 
      of each patient’s household. The SHW was initially tested for its suitability for 
      treating 4 specialized diseases, including cardiovascular disease, stroke, 
      Parkinson disease, and Alzheimer disease. Understanding and addressing the 
      potential challenges and risks associated with SHWs is essential for the 
      successful implementation and maintenance of safe and effective home 
      hospitalization.

TI  - Feasibility of remote monitoring for fatal coronary heart disease using Apple 
      Watch ECGs.
PG  - 115-121
LID - 10.1016/j.cvdhj.2024.03.007 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fatal coronary heart disease (FCHD) is often described as sudden 
      cardiac death (affects >4 million people/year), where coronary artery disease is 
      the only identified condition. Electrocardiographic artificial intelligence 
      (ECG-AI) models for FCHD risk prediction using ECG data from wearable devices 
      could enable wider screening/monitoring efforts. OBJECTIVES: To develop a 
      single-lead ECG-based deep learning model for FCHD risk prediction and assess 
      concordance between clinical and Apple Watch ECGs. METHODS: An FCHD single-lead 
      ("lead I" from 12-lead ECGs) ECG-AI model was developed using 167,662 ECGs 
      (50,132 patients) from the University of Tennessee Health Sciences Center. Eighty 
      percent of the data (5-fold cross-validation) was used for training and 20% as a 
      holdout. Cox proportional hazards (CPH) models incorporating ECG-AI predictions 
      with age, sex, and race were also developed. The models were tested on paired 
      clinical single-lead and Apple Watch ECGs from 243 St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study 
      participants. The correlation and concordance of the predictions were assessed 
      using Pearson correlation (R), Spearman correlation (ρ), and Cohen's kappa. 
      RESULTS: The ECG-AI and CPH models resulted in AUC = 0.76 and 0.79, respectively, 
      on the 20% holdout and AUC = 0.85 and 0.87 on the Atrium Health Wake Forest 
      Baptist external validation data. There was moderate-strong positive correlation 
      between predictions (R = 0.74, ρ = 0.67, and κ = 0.58) when tested on the 243 
      paired ECGs. The clinical (lead I) and Apple Watch predictions led to the same 
      low/high-risk FCHD classification for 99% of the participants. CPH prediction 
      correlation resulted in an R = 0.81, ρ = 0.76, and κ = 0.78. CONCLUSION: Risk of 
      FCHD can be predicted from single-lead ECGs obtained from wearable devices and 
      are statistically concordant with lead I of a 12-lead ECG.

TI  - Optimization System Based on Convolutional Neural Network and Internet of Medical 
      Things for Early Diagnosis of Lung Cancer.
LID - 10.3390/bioengineering10030320 [doi]
LID - 320
AB  - Recently, deep learning and the Internet of Things (IoT) have been widely used in 
      the healthcare monitoring system for decision making. Disease prediction is one 
      of the emerging applications in current practices. In the method described in 
      this paper, lung cancer prediction is implemented using deep learning and IoT, 
      which is a challenging task in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). Because lung 
      cancer is a dangerous medical disease that must be identified at a higher 
      detection rate, disease-related information is obtained from IoT medical devices 
      and transmitted to the server. The medical data are then processed and classified 
      into two categories, benign and malignant, using a multi-layer CNN (ML-CNN) 
      model. In addition, a particle swarm optimization method is used to improve the 
      learning ability (loss and accuracy). This step uses medical data (CT scan and 
      sensor information) based on the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). For this 
      purpose, sensor information and image information from IoMT devices and sensors 
      are gathered, and then classification actions are taken. The performance of the 
      proposed technique is compared with well-known existing methods, such as the 
      Support Vector Machine (SVM), probabilistic neural network (PNN), and 
      conventional CNN, in terms of accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, 
      F-score, and computation time. For this purpose, two lung datasets were tested to 
      evaluate the performance: Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC) and Linear 
      Imaging and Self-Scanning Sensor (LISS) datasets. Compared to alternative 
      methods, the trial outcomes showed that the suggested technique has the potential 
      to help the radiologist make an accurate and efficient early lung cancer 
      diagnosis. The performance of the proposed ML-CNN was analyzed using Python, 
      where the accuracy (2.5-10.5%) was high when compared to the number of instances, 
      precision (2.3-9.5%) was high when compared to the number of instances, 
      sensitivity (2.4-12.5%) was high when compared to several instances, the F-score 
      (2-30%) was high when compared to the number of cases, the error rate (0.7-11.5%) 
      was low compared to the number of cases, and the computation time (170 ms to 400 
      ms) was low compared to how many cases were computed for the proposed work, 
      including previous known methods. The proposed ML-CNN architecture shows that 
      this technique outperforms previous works.

AB  - Falls are one of the leading causes of permanent injury and/or disability among 
      the elderly. When these people live alone, it is convenient that a caregiver or 
      family member visits them periodically. However, these visits do not prevent 
      falls when the elderly person is alone. Furthermore, in exceptional 
      circumstances, such as a pandemic, we must avoid unnecessary mobility. This is 
      why remote monitoring systems are currently on the rise, and several commercial 
      solutions can be found. However, current solutions use devices attached to the 
      waist or wrist, causing discomfort in the people who wear them. The users also 
      tend to forget to wear the devices carried in these positions. Therefore, in 
      order to prevent these problems, the main objective of this work is designing and 
      recollecting a new dataset about falls, falling risks and activities of daily 
      living using an ankle-placed device obtaining a good balance between the 
      different activity types. This dataset will be a useful tool for researchers who 
      want to integrate the fall detector in the footwear. Thus, in this work we design 
      the fall-detection device, study the suitable activities to be collected, collect 
      the dataset from 21 users performing the studied activities and evaluate the 
      quality of the collected dataset. As an additional and secondary study, we 
      implement a simple Deep Learning classifier based on this data to prove the 
      system's feasibility.

AB  - Recently, wearable and flexible pressure sensors have sparked tremendous research 
      interest, and considerable applications including human activity monitoring, 
      biomedical research, and artificial intelligence interaction are reported. 
      However, the large-scale preparation of low-cost, high-sensitivity piezoresistive 
      sensors still face huge challenges. Inspired by the specific structures and 
      excellent metal conductivity of a family of two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal 
      carbides and nitrides (MXene) and the high-performance sensing effect of human 
      skin including randomly distributed microstructural receptors, we fabricate a 
      highly sensitive MXene-based piezoresistive sensor with bioinspired microspinous 
      microstructures formed by a simple abrasive paper stencil printing process. The 
      obtained piezoresistive sensor shows high sensitivity (151.4 kPa(-1)), relatively 
      short response time (<130 ms), subtle pressure detection limit of 4.4 Pa, and 
      excellent cycle stability over 10,000 cycles. The mechanism of the high 
      sensitivity of the sensor is dynamically revealed from the structural perspective 
      by means of in situ electron microscopy experiment and finite element simulation. 
      Bioinspired microspinous microstructures can effectively improve the sensitivity 
      of the pressure sensor and the limit of the detectable subtle pressure. In 
      practice, the sensor shows great performance in monitoring human physiological 
      signals, detecting quantitatively pressure distributions, and remote monitoring 
      of intelligent robot motion in real time.

TI  - Predicting post-discharge complications in cardiothoracic surgery: A clinical 
      decision support system to optimize remote patient monitoring resources.

AB  - Cardiac surgery patients are highly prone to severe complications post-discharge. 
      Close follow-up through remote patient monitoring can help detect adverse 
      outcomes earlier or prevent them, closing the gap between hospital and home care. 
      However, equipment is limited due to economic and human resource constraints. 
      This issue raises the need for efficient risk estimation to provide clinicians 
      with insights into the potential benefit of remote monitoring for each patient. 
      Standard models, such as the EuroSCORE, predict the mortality risk before the 
      surgery. While these are used and validated in real settings, the models lack 
      information collected during or following the surgery, determinant to predict 
      adverse outcomes occurring further in the future. This paper proposes a Clinical 
      Decision Support System based on Machine Learning to estimate the risk of severe 
      complications within 90 days following cardiothoracic surgery discharge, an 
      innovative objective underexplored in the literature. Health records from a 
      cardiothoracic surgery department regarding 5 045 patients (60.8% male) collected 
      throughout ten years were used to train predictive models. Clinicians' insights 
      contributed to improving data preparation and extending traditional pipeline 
      optimization techniques, addressing medical Artificial Intelligence requirements. 
      Two separate test sets were used to evaluate the generalizability, one derived 
      from a patient-grouped 70/30 split and another including all surgeries from the 
      last available year. The achieved Area Under the Receiver Operating 
      Characteristic curve on these test sets was 69.5% and 65.3%, respectively. Also, 
      additional testing was implemented to simulate a real-world use case considering 
      the weekly distribution of remote patient monitoring resources post-discharge. 
      Compared to the random resource allocation, the selection of patients with 
      respect to the outputs of the proposed model was proven beneficial, as it led to 
      a higher number of high-risk patients receiving remote monitoring equipment.

TI  - Examining the challenges of blood pressure estimation via photoplethysmogram.
PG  - 18318
LID - 10.1038/s41598-024-68862-1 [doi]
LID - 18318
AB  - The use of observed wearable sensor data (e.g., photoplethysmograms [PPG]) to 
      infer health measures (e.g., glucose level or blood pressure) is a very active 
      area of research. Such technology can have a significant impact on health 
      screening, chronic disease management and remote monitoring. A common approach is 
      to collect sensor data and corresponding labels from a clinical grade device 
      (e.g., blood pressure cuff) and train deep learning models to map one to the 
      other. Although well intentioned, this approach often ignores a principled 
      analysis of whether the input sensor data have enough information to predict the 
      desired metric. We analyze the task of predicting blood pressure from PPG pulse 
      wave analysis. Our review of the prior work reveals that many papers fall prey to 
      data leakage and unrealistic constraints on the task and preprocessing steps. We 
      propose a set of tools to help determine if the input signal in question (e.g., 
      PPG) is indeed a good predictor of the desired label (e.g., blood pressure). 
      Using our proposed tools, we found that blood pressure prediction using PPG has a 
      high multi-valued mapping factor of 33.2% and low mutual information of 9.8%. In 
      comparison, heart rate prediction using PPG, a well-established task, has a very 
      low multi-valued mapping factor of 0.75% and high mutual information of 87.7%. We 
      argue that these results provide a more realistic representation of the current 
      progress toward the goal of wearable blood pressure measurement via PPG pulse 
      wave analysis. For code, see our project page:

TI  - Wearable Sensor to Monitor Quality of Upper Limb Task Practice for Stroke 
      Survivors at Home.
LID - 10.3390/s24020554 [doi]
LID - 554
AB  - Many stroke survivors experience persistent upper extremity impairment that 
      limits performance in activities of daily living. Upper limb recovery requires 
      high repetitions of task-specific practice. Stroke survivors are often prescribed 
      task practices at home to supplement rehabilitation therapy. A poor quality of 
      task practices, such as the use of compensatory movement patterns, results in 
      maladaptive neuroplasticity and suboptimal motor recovery. There currently lacks 
      a tool for the remote monitoring of movement quality of stroke survivors' task 
      practices at home. The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of 
      classifying movement quality at home using a wearable IMU. Nineteen stroke 
      survivors wore an IMU sensor on the paretic wrist and performed four functional 
      upper limb tasks in the lab and later at home while videorecording themselves. 
      The lab data served as reference data to classify home movement quality using 
      dynamic time warping. Incorrect and correct movement quality was labeled by a 
      therapist. The home task practice movement quality was classified with an 
      accuracy of 92% and F1 score of 0.95 for all tasks combined. Movement types 
      contributing to misclassification were further investigated. The results support 
      the feasibility of a home movement quality monitoring system to assist with upper 
      limb rehabilitation post stroke.

TI  - Bottom-Up Analysis of Telemonitoring Costs: A Case Study in Slovenian Primary 
      Care.
PG  - 5-13
LID - 10.2478/sjph-2024-0002 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Telemonitoring improves clinical outcomes in patients with arterial 
      hypertension (AH) and type 2 diabetes (T2D), however, cost structure analyses are 
      lacking. This study seeks to explore the cost structure of telemonitoring for the 
      elderly with AH and T2D in primary care and identify factors influencing costs 
      for potential future expansions. METHODS: Infrastructure, operational, patient 
      participation, and out-of-pocket costs were determined using a bottom-up 
      approach. Infrastructure costs were determined by dividing equipment and 
      telemonitoring platform expenses by the number of participants. Operational and 
      patient participation costs were determined by considering patient training time, 
      data measurement/review time, and teleconsultation time. The change in 
      out-of-pocket costs was assessed in both groups using a structured questionnaire 
      and 12-month expenditure data. Statistical analysis employed an unpaired sample 
      t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, and chi-square test. RESULTS: A total of 117 
      patients aged 71.4±4.7 years were included in the study. The telemonitoring 
      intervention incurred an annual infrastructure costs of €489.4 and operational 
      costs of €97.3 (95% CI 85.7-109.0) per patient. Patient annual participation 
      costs were €215.6 (95% CI 190.9-241.1). Average annual out-of-pocket costs for 
      both groups were €345 (95% CI 221-469). After 12 months the telemonitoring group 
      reported significantly lower out-of-pocket costs (€132 vs. €545, p<0.001), driven 
      by reduced spending on food, dietary supplements, medical equipment, and 
      specialist check-ups compared to the standard care group. CONCLUSION: To optimise 
      the cost structure of telemonitoring, strategies like shortening the 
      telemonitoring period, developing a national telemonitoring platform, using 
      patient devices, integrating artificial intelligence into platforms, and 
      involving nurse practitioners as telemedicine centre coordinators should be 
      explored.

TI  - A Multimodel-Based Screening Framework for C-19 Using Deep Learning-Inspired Data 
      Fusion.
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2024.3400878 [doi]
AB  - In recent times, there has been a notable rise in the utilization of Internet of 
      Medical Things (IoMT) frameworks particularly those based on edge computing, to 
      enhance remote monitoring in healthcare applications. Most existing models in 
      this field have been developed temperature screening methods using RCNN, face 
      temperature encoder (FTE), and a combination of data from wearable sensors for 
      predicting respiratory rate (RR) and monitoring blood pressure. These methods aim 
      to facilitate remote screening and monitoring of Severe Acute Respiratory 
      Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and COVID-19. However, these models require 
      inadequate computing resources and are not suitable for lightweight environments. 
      We propose a multimodal screening framework that leverages deep learning-inspired 
      data fusion models to enhance screening results. A Variation Encoder (VEN) design 
      proposes to measure skin temperature using Regions of Interest (RoI) identified 
      by YoLo. Subsequently, the multi-data fusion model integrates electronic records 
      features with data from wearable human sensors. To optimize computational 
      efficiency, a data reduction mechanism is added to eliminate unnecessary 
      features. Furthermore, we employ a contingent probability method to estimate 
      distinct feature weights for each cluster, deepening our understanding of 
      variations in thermal and sensory data to assess the prediction of abnormal 
      COVID-19 instances. Simulation results using our lab dataset demonstrate a 
      precision of 95.2%, surpassing state-of-the-art models due to the thoughtful 
      design of the multimodal data-based feature fusion model, weight prediction 
      factor, and feature selection model.

AB  - With keen interest and seriousness, we have read the article "Smart Technologies 
      used as Smart Tools in the Management of Cardiovascular Disease and their Future 
      Perspective" by Muneeb Ullah et al. and writing to provide a critique. For its 
      clarity and conciseness, we applaud the author for his extensive research on this 
      delicate topic. The authors have concisely written several scenarios of using 
      smart technologies used as smart tools in the management of cardiovascular 
      disease, such as wearable devices, mobile applications,3D printing technologies, 
      artificial intelligence, remote monitoring systems, and electronic health 
      records. Nonetheless, While the study addresses an important topic in the field 
      of cardiology, we believe there are certain aspects that require further 
      consideration and exploration.

TI  - Human Activity Recognition in a Free-Living Environment Using an Ear-Worn Motion 
      Sensor.
LID - 10.3390/s24092665 [doi]
LID - 2665
AB  - Human activity recognition (HAR) technology enables continuous behavior 
      monitoring, which is particularly valuable in healthcare. This study investigates 
      the viability of using an ear-worn motion sensor for classifying daily 
      activities, including lying, sitting/standing, walking, ascending stairs, 
      descending stairs, and running. Fifty healthy participants (between 20 and 47 
      years old) engaged in these activities while under monitoring. Various machine 
      learning algorithms, ranging from interpretable shallow models to 
      state-of-the-art deep learning approaches designed for HAR (i.e., DeepConvLSTM 
      and ConvTransformer), were employed for classification. The results demonstrate 
      the ear sensor's efficacy, with deep learning models achieving a 98% accuracy 
      rate of classification. The obtained classification models are agnostic regarding 
      which ear the sensor is worn and robust against moderate variations in sensor 
      orientation (e.g., due to differences in auricle anatomy), meaning no initial 
      calibration of the sensor orientation is required. The study underscores the 
      ear's efficacy as a suitable site for monitoring human daily activity and 
      suggests its potential for combining HAR with in-ear vital sign monitoring. This 
      approach offers a practical method for comprehensive health monitoring by 
      integrating sensors in a single anatomical location. This integration facilitates 
      individualized health assessments, with potential applications in 
      tele-monitoring, personalized health insights, and optimizing athletic training 
      regimes.

TI  - Improved prognosis and evidence of enhanced immunogenicity in tumor and 
      circulation of high-risk melanoma patients with unknown primary.
LID - 10.1136/jitc-2021-004310 [doi]
LID - e004310
AB  - BACKGROUND: Melanoma of unknown primary (MUP) represents a poorly understood 
      group of patients both clinically and immunologically. We investigated 
      differences in prognosis and candidate immune biomarkers in patients with unknown 
      compared with those with known primary melanoma enrolled in the E1609 adjuvant 
      trial that tested ipilimumab at 3 and 10 mg/kg vs high-dose interferon-alfa 
      (HDI). PATIENTS AND METHODS: MUP status was defined as initial presentation with 
      cutaneous, nodal or distant metastasis without a known primary. Relapse-free 
      survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier 
      method. Stratified (by stage) log-rank test was used to compare RFS and OS by 
      primary tumor status. Gene expression profiling (GEP) was performed on the tumor 
      biopsies of a subset of patients. Similarly, peripheral blood samples were tested 
      for candidate soluble and cellular immune biomarkers. RESULTS: MUP cases 
      represented 12.8% of the total population (N=1699) including 11.7% on the 
      ipilimumab arms and 14.7% on the HDI arm. Stratifying by stage, RFS (p=0.001) and 
      overall survival (OS) (p=0.009) showed outcomes significantly better for patients 
      with unknown primary. The primary tumor status remained prognostically 
      significant after adjusting for treatment and stage in multivariate Cox 
      proportional hazards models. Including only ipilimumab-treated patients, RFS 
      (p=0.005) and OS (p=0.023) were significantly better in favor of those with 
      unknown primary. Among patients with GEP data (n=718; 102 MUP, 616 known), GEP 
      identified pathways and genes related to autoimmunity, inflammation, immune cell 
      infiltration and immune activation that were significantly enriched in the MUP 
      tumors compared with known primaries. Further investigation into infiltrating 
      immune cell types estimated significant enrichment with CD8 +and CD4+T cells, B 
      cells and NK cells as well as significantly higher major histocompatibility 
      complex (MHC)-I and MHC-II scores in MUP compared with known primary. Among 
      patients tested for circulating biomarkers (n=321; 66 unknown and 255 known), 
      patients with MUP had significantly higher circulating levels of IL-2R (p=0.04). 
      CONCLUSION: Patients with MUP and high-risk melanoma had significantly better 
      prognosis and evidence of significantly enhanced immune activation within the TME 
      and the circulation, supporting the designation of MUP as a distinct prognostic 
      marker in patients with high-risk melanoma.

TI  - X-CHAR: A Concept-based Explainable Complex Human Activity Recognition Model.
LID - 17 [pii]
LID - 10.1145/3580804 [doi]
AB  - End-to-end deep learning models are increasingly applied to safety-critical human 
      activity recognition (HAR) applications, e.g., healthcare monitoring and smart 
      home control, to reduce developer burden and increase the performance and 
      robustness of prediction models. However, integrating HAR models in 
      safety-critical applications requires trust, and recent approaches have aimed to 
      balance the performance of deep learning models with explainable decision-making 
      for complex activity recognition. Prior works have exploited the compositionality 
      of complex HAR (i.e., higher-level activities composed of lower-level activities) 
      to form models with symbolic interfaces, such as concept-bottleneck 
      architectures, that facilitate inherently interpretable models. However, feature 
      engineering for symbolic concepts-as well as the relationship between the 
      concepts-requires precise annotation of lower-level activities by domain experts, 
      usually with fixed time windows, all of which induce a heavy and error-prone 
      workload on the domain expert. In this paper, we introduce X-CHAR , an 
      eXplainable Complex Human Activity Recognition model that doesn't require precise 
      annotation of low-level activities, offers explanations in the form of 
      human-understandable, high-level concepts, while maintaining the robust 
      performance of end-to-end deep learning models for time series data. X-CHAR 
      learns to model complex activity recognition in the form of a sequence of 
      concepts. For each classification, X-CHAR outputs a sequence of concepts and a 
      counterfactual example as the explanation. We show that the sequence information 
      of the concepts can be modeled using Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) 
      loss without having accurate start and end times of low-level annotations in the 
      training dataset-significantly reducing developer burden. We evaluate our model 
      on several complex activity datasets and demonstrate that our model offers 
      explanations without compromising the prediction accuracy in comparison to 
      baseline models. Finally, we conducted a mechanical Turk study to show that the 
      explanations provided by our model are more understandable than the explanations 
      from existing methods for complex activity recognition.

TI  - Data-driven systems to detect physical weakening from daily routine: A pilot 
      study on elderly over 80 years old.
PG  - e0274306
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0274306 [doi]
LID - e0274306
AB  - The use of telemonitoring solutions via wearable sensors is believed to play a 
      major role in the prevention and therapy of physical weakening in older adults. 
      Despite the various studies found in the literature, some elements are still not 
      well addressed, such as the study cohort, the experimental protocol, the type of 
      research design, as well as the relevant features in this context. To this end, 
      the objective of this pilot study was to investigate the efficacy of data-driven 
      systems to characterize older individuals over 80 years of age with impaired 
      physical function, during their daily routine and under unsupervised conditions. 
      We propose a fully automated process which extracts a set of heterogeneous 
      time-domain features from 24-hour files of acceleration and barometric data. 
      After being statistically tested, the most discriminant features fed a group of 
      machine learning classifiers to distinguish frail from non-frail subjects, 
      achieving an accuracy up to 93.51%. Our analysis, conducted over 570 days of 
      recordings, shows that a longitudinal study is important while using the proposed 
      features, in order to ensure a highly specific diagnosis. This work may serve as 
      a basis for the paradigm of future monitoring systems.

TI  - Comparison Between QT and Corrected QT Interval Assessment by an Apple Watch With 
      the AccurBeat Platform and by a 12‑Lead Electrocardiogram With Manual Annotation: 
      Prospective Observational Study.
PG  - e41241
LID - 10.2196/41241 [doi]
LID - e41241
AB  - BACKGROUND: Abnormal prolongation or shortening of the QT interval is associated 
      with increased risk for ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. For 
      continuous monitoring, widespread use, and prevention of cardiac events, advanced 
      wearable technologies are emerging as promising surrogates for conventional 
      12‑lead electrocardiogram (ECG) QT interval assessment. Previous studies have 
      shown a good agreement between QT and corrected QT (QTc) intervals measured on a 
      smartwatch ECG and a 12-lead ECG, but the clinical accuracy of computerized 
      algorithms for QT and QTc interval measurement from smartwatch ECGs is unclear. 
      OBJECTIVE: The prospective observational study compared the smartwatch-recorded 
      QT and QTc assessed using AccurKardia's AccurBeat platform with the conventional 
      12‑lead ECG annotated manually by a cardiologist. METHODS: ECGs were collected 
      from healthy participants (without any known cardiovascular disease) aged >22 
      years. Two consecutive 30-second ECG readings followed by (within 15 minutes) a 
      10-second standard 12-lead ECG were recorded for each participant. 
      Characteristics of the participants were compared by sex using a 2-sample t test 
      and Wilcoxon rank sum test. Statistical comparisons of heart rate (HR), QT 
      interval, and QTc interval between the platform and the 12-lead ECG, ECG lead I, 
      and ECG lead II were done using the Wilcoxon sign rank test. Linear regression 
      was used to predict QTc and QT intervals from the ECG based on the platform's 
      QTc/QT intervals with adjustment for age, sex, and difference in HR measurement. 
      The Bland-Altman method was used to check agreement between various QT and QTc 
      interval measurements. RESULTS: A total of 50 participants (32 female, mean age 
      46 years, SD 1 year) were included in the study. The result of the regression 
      model using the platform measurements to predict the 12-lead ECG measurements 
      indicated that, in univariate analysis, QT/QTc intervals from the platform 
      significantly predicted QT/QTc intervals from the 12-lead ECG, ECG lead I, and 
      ECG lead II, and this remained significant after adjustment for sex, age, and 
      change in HR. The Bland-Altman plot results found that 96% of the average QTc 
      interval measurements between the platform and QTc intervals from the 12-lead ECG 
      were within the 95% confidence limit of the average difference between the two 
      measurements, with a mean difference of -10.5 (95% limits of agreement -71.43, 
      50.43). A total of 94% of the average QT interval measurements between the 
      platform and the 12-lead ECG were within the 95% CI of the average difference 
      between the two measurements, with a mean difference of -6.3 (95% limits of 
      agreement -54.54, 41.94). CONCLUSIONS: QT and QTc intervals obtained by a 
      smartwatch coupled with the platform's assessment were comparable to those from a 
      12-lead ECG. Accordingly, with further refinements, remote monitoring using this 
      technology holds promise for the identification of QT interval prolongation.

TI  - PUFchain 3.0: Hardware-Assisted Distributed Ledger for Robust Authentication in 
      Healthcare Cyber-Physical Systems.
LID - 10.3390/s24030938 [doi]
LID - 938
AB  - This article presents a novel hardware-assisted distributed ledger-based solution 
      for simultaneous device and data security in smart healthcare. This article 
      presents a novel architecture that integrates PUF, blockchain, and Tangle for 
      Security-by-Design (SbD) of healthcare cyber-physical systems (H-CPSs). 
      Healthcare systems around the world have undergone massive technological 
      transformation and have seen growing adoption with the advancement of 
      Internet-of-Medical Things (IoMT). The technological transformation of healthcare 
      systems to telemedicine, e-health, connected health, and remote health is being 
      made possible with the sophisticated integration of IoMT with machine learning, 
      big data, artificial intelligence (AI), and other technologies. As healthcare 
      systems are becoming more accessible and advanced, security and privacy have 
      become pivotal for the smooth integration and functioning of various systems in 
      H-CPSs. In this work, we present a novel approach that integrates PUF with IOTA 
      Tangle and blockchain and works by storing the PUF keys of a patient's Body Area 
      Network (BAN) inside blockchain to access, store, and share globally. Each 
      patient has a network of smart wearables and a gateway to obtain the 
      physiological sensor data securely. To facilitate communication among various 
      stakeholders in healthcare systems, IOTA Tangle's Masked Authentication Messaging 
      (MAM) communication protocol has been used, which securely enables patients to 
      communicate, share, and store data on Tangle. The MAM channel works in the 
      restricted mode in the proposed architecture, which can be accessed using the 
      patient's gateway PUF key. Furthermore, the successful verification of PUF 
      enables patients to securely send and share physiological sensor data from 
      various wearable and implantable medical devices embedded with PUF. Finally, 
      healthcare system entities like physicians, hospital admin networks, and remote 
      monitoring systems can securely establish communication with patients using MAM 
      and retrieve the patient's BAN PUF keys from the blockchain securely. Our 
      experimental analysis shows that the proposed approach successfully integrates 
      three security primitives, PUF, blockchain, and Tangle, providing decentralized 
      access control and security in H-CPS with minimal energy requirements, data 
      storage, and response time.

TI  - Distant metastasis prediction via a multi-feature fusion model in breast cancer.
PG  - 18151-18162
LID - 10.18632/aging.103630 [doi]
AB  - This study aimed to develop a model that fused multiple features (multi-feature 
      fusion model) for predicting metachronous distant metastasis (DM) in breast 
      cancer (BC) based on clinicopathological characteristics and magnetic resonance 
      imaging (MRI). A nomogram based on clinicopathological features 
      (clinicopathological-feature model) and a nomogram based on the multi-feature 
      fusion model were constructed based on BC patients with DM (n=67) and matched 
      patients (n=134) without DM. DM was diagnosed on average (17.31±13.12) months 
      after diagnosis. The clinicopathological-feature model included seven features: 
      reproductive history, lymph node metastasis, estrogen receptor status, 
      progesterone receptor status, CA153, CEA, and endocrine therapy. The 
      multi-feature fusion model included the same features and an additional three MRI 
      features (multiple masses, fat-saturated T2WI signal, and mass size). The 
      multi-feature fusion model was relatively better at predicting DM. The 
      sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic accuracy and AUC of the multi-feature fusion 
      model were 0.746 (95% CI: 0.623-0.841), 0.806 (0.727-0.867), 0.786 (0.723-0.841), 
      and 0.854 (0.798-0.911), respectively. Both internal and external validations 
      suggested good generalizability of the multi-feature fusion model to the clinic. 
      The incorporation of MRI factors significantly improved the specificity and 
      sensitivity of the nomogram. The constructed multi-feature fusion nomogram may 
      guide DM screening and the implementation of prophylactic treatment for BC.

TI  - Exercise Exertion Level Prediction Using Data from Wearable Physiologic Monitors.
PG  - 653-662
AB  - This study aims to develop machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict exercise 
      exertion levels using physiological parameters collected from wearable devices. 
      Real-time ECG, oxygen saturation, pulse rate, and revolutions per minute (RPM) 
      data were collected at three intensity levels during a 16-minute cycling 
      exercise. Parallel to this, throughout each exercise session, the study subjects' 
      ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) were gathered once per minute. Each 16-minute 
      exercise session was divided into a total of eight 2-minute windows. Each 
      exercise window was labeled as "high exertion," or "low exertion" classes based 
      on the self-reported RPEs. For each window, the gathered ECG data were used to 
      derive the heart rate variability (HRV) features in the temporal and frequency 
      domains. Additionally, each window's averaged RPMs, heart rate, and oxygen 
      saturation levels were calculated to form all the predictive features. The 
      minimum redundancy maximum relevance algorithm was used to choose the best 
      predictive features. Top selected features were then used to assess the accuracy 
      of ten ML classifiers to predict the next window's exertion level. The k-nearest 
      neighbors (KNN) model showed the highest accuracy of 85.7% and the highest F1 
      score of 83%. An ensemble model showed the highest area under the curve (AUC) of 
      0.92. The suggested method can be used to automatically track perceived exercise 
      exertion in real-time.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the utilization status and awareness of digital 
      hospital construction among medical staff in critical care department of primary 
      hospitals, so as to promote the process of digital medical health. METHODS: One 
      to two doctors and nurses (in the department on that day) from public hospitals 
      in 88 counties and urban areas in 9 cities of Guizhou Province were enrolled of 
      field investigation. The questionnaires form were filled in on-site and sorted 
      out and analyzed by special personnel. RESULTS: A total of 297 medical staff from 
      the department of critical care medicine of 146 hospitals were included. All the 
      questionnaires were filled in with their real names, including 152 doctors and 
      145 nurses. There were 24 class III Grade A hospitals and 122 class II and all 
      the hospitals had implemented digital information management. The awareness of 
      hospital digital information management system was generally low among the 
      surveyed medical staff, and the awareness of hospital information system (HIS) 
      was the highest (86.5%), followed by laboratory information management system 
      (LIS, 41.4%) and image archiving and communication system (PACS, 40.7%). The 
      awareness of hospital management system (HERP) was the lowest (7.7%). The total 
      number of remote consultations conducted by hospitals using big data Internet was 
      25 428 times in 2020, with a median of 24.5 (88.0, 240.0) times in each hospital. 
      From 2018 to 2020, the total number of patients admitted to the intensive care 
      unit of the hospital was 50 473, 57 565 and 57 907, respectively, of which the 
      number of patients over 65 years old accounted for 37.47%, 41.26% and 43.31%, 
      respectively (all P > 0.05). There were 4 242 cases of remote consultation using 
      big data Internet in the department every year, with a median of 257.50 (96.50, 
      958.25) cases. 12.12% of the departments had independent critical monitoring 
      systems, and 8.75% of them could capture data automatically to form tables. 
      96.30% of the medical staff participated in systematic and professional training 
      on basic knowledge, basic theory and basic medical care skills through the 
      Internet platform, and the number of meetings, studies and training in the 
      provinces and prefectures were 282 and 357 times per year, respectively. More 
      than 90% of the departments initiated remote consultation, arranged referral or 
      admitted patients who had improved status after treatment in superior hospitals 
      through the Internet platform. Most of the patients (69.02%) were from the lower 
      level of the hospital. The total number of out-patient consultations was 2 959 
      times per year, with a median of 296 (185 473) times. 54.79% of the departments 
      had fixed service villages, and 28.08% of the departments had fixed service 
      population. The median furthest visit distance was 52.5 (30.0, 80.0) kilometers, 
      and the median average visit distance was 30.0 (20.0, 50.0) kilometers. 54.88% of 
      medical staff believed that the biggest difficulties encountered during house 
      visits were insufficient energy and too large service groups or regions. More 
      than 90% of medical staff had been exposed to cloud learning and cloud training, 
      and most of the surveyed medical staff believed that cloud learning and cloud 
      training greatly improved medical service capacity and service efficiency of 
      medical institutions (71.04% and 67.01%, respectively). Meanwhile, they believe 
      that "Internet+health big data" projects from various aspects brought advantage 
      to medical institutions, but there are also low utilization rate of Internet 
      medical equipment by village doctors, low acceptance for telemedicine and mobile 
      hospitals by farmers. CONCLUSIONS: Guizhou public hospitals have implementation 
      of digital information management at the grass-roots level, the surveyed health 
      care workers have a relatively low awareness of the digital information 
      management system, hospital use big data Internet for remote consultation is 
      uneven, intensive care medicine is a clinical discipline used in most remote 
      consultation information system, and can complete two-way referrals. In the past 
      three years, the discipline operation showed an upward trend year by year. 
      Medical staff use artificial intelligence devices such as cloud learning and 
      training to improve medical service capacity and efficiency. The digital 
      transformation of primary hospitals is being continuously improved.

TI  - Photoplethysmography Signal Wavelet Enhancement and Novel Features Selection for 
      Non-Invasive Cuff-Less Blood Pressure Monitoring.
LID - 10.3390/s23042321 [doi]
LID - 2321
AB  - In this paper, new features relevant to blood pressure (BP) estimation using 
      photoplethysmography (PPG) are presented. A total of 195 features, including the 
      proposed ones and those already known in the literature, have been calculated on 
      a set composed of 50,000 pulses from 1080 different patients. Three feature 
      selection methods, namely Correlation-based Feature Selection (CFS), RReliefF and 
      Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (MRMR), have then been applied to identify 
      the most significant features for BP estimation. Some of these features have been 
      extracted through a novel PPG signal enhancement method based on the use of the 
      Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform (MODWT). As a matter of fact, the 
      enhanced signal leads to a reliable identification of the characteristic points 
      of the PPG signal (e.g., systolic, diastolic and dicrotic notch points) by simple 
      means, obtaining results comparable with those from purposely defined algorithms. 
      For systolic points, mean and std of errors computed as the difference between 
      the locations obtained using a purposely defined already known algorithm and 
      those using the MODWT enhancement are, respectively, 0.0097 s and 0.0202 s; for 
      diastolic points they are, respectively, 0.0441 s and 0.0486 s; for dicrotic 
      notch points they are 0.0458 s and 0.0896 s. Hence, this study leads to the 
      selection of several new features from the MODWT enhanced signal on every single 
      pulse extracted from PPG signals, in addition to features already known in the 
      literature. These features can be employed to train machine learning (ML) models 
      useful for estimating systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure 
      (DBP) in a non-invasive way, which is suitable for telemedicine health-care 
      monitoring.

TI  - A Federated Database for Obesity Research: An IMI-SOPHIA Study.
LID - 10.3390/life14020262 [doi]
LID - 262
AB  - Obesity is considered by many as a lifestyle choice rather than a chronic 
      progressive disease. The Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) SOPHIA 
      (Stratification of Obesity Phenotypes to Optimize Future Obesity Therapy) project 
      is part of a momentum shift aiming to provide better tools for the stratification 
      of people with obesity according to disease risk and treatment response. One of 
      the challenges to achieving these goals is that many clinical cohorts are siloed, 
      limiting the potential of combined data for biomarker discovery. In SOPHIA, we 
      have addressed this challenge by setting up a federated database building on 
      open-source DataSHIELD technology. The database currently federates 16 cohorts 
      that are accessible via a central gateway. The database is multi-modal, including 
      research studies, clinical trials, and routine health data, and is accessed using 
      the R statistical programming environment where statistical and machine learning 
      analyses can be performed at a distance without any disclosure of patient-level 
      data. We demonstrate the use of the database by providing a proof-of-concept 
      analysis, performing a federated linear model of BMI and systolic blood pressure, 
      pooling all data from 16 studies virtually without any analyst seeing individual 
      patient-level data. This analysis provided similar point estimates compared to a 
      meta-analysis of the 16 individual studies. Our approach provides a benchmark for 
      reproducible, safe federated analyses across multiple study types provided by 
      multiple stakeholders.

TI  - Optimization of Using Multiple Machine Learning Approaches in Atrial Fibrillation 
      Detection Based on a Large-Scale Data Set of 12-Lead Electrocardiograms: 
      Cross-Sectional Study.
PG  - e47803
LID - 10.2196/47803 [doi]
LID - e47803
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) represents a hazardous cardiac arrhythmia 
      that significantly elevates the risk of stroke and heart failure. Despite its 
      severity, its diagnosis largely relies on the proficiency of health care 
      professionals. At present, the real-time identification of paroxysmal AF is 
      hindered by the lack of automated techniques. Consequently, a highly effective 
      machine learning algorithm specifically designed for AF detection could offer 
      substantial clinical benefits. We hypothesized that machine learning algorithms 
      have the potential to identify and extract features of AF with a high degree of 
      accuracy, given the intricate and distinctive patterns present in 
      electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings of AF. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop a 
      clinically valuable machine learning algorithm that can accurately detect AF and 
      compare different leads' performances of AF detection. METHODS: We used 12-lead 
      ECG recordings sourced from the 2020 PhysioNet Challenge data sets. The Welch 
      method was used to extract power spectral features of the 12-lead ECGs within a 
      frequency range of 0.083 to 24.92 Hz. Subsequently, various machine learning 
      techniques were evaluated and optimized to classify sinus rhythm (SR) and AF 
      based on these power spectral features. Furthermore, we compared the effects of 
      different frequency subbands and different lead selections on machine learning 
      performances. RESULTS: The light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) was found 
      to be the most effective in classifying AF and SR, achieving an average 
      F(1)-score of 0.988 across all ECG leads. Among the frequency subbands, the 0.083 
      to 4.92 Hz range yielded the highest F(1)-score of 0.985. In interlead 
      comparisons, aVR had the highest performance (F(1)=0.993), with minimal 
      differences observed between leads. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, this study 
      successfully used machine learning methodologies, particularly the LightGBM 
      model, to differentiate SR and AF based on power spectral features derived from 
      12-lead ECGs. The performance marked by an average F(1)-score of 0.988 and 
      minimal interlead variation underscores the potential of machine learning 
      algorithms to bolster real-time AF detection. This advancement could 
      significantly improve patient care in intensive care units as well as facilitate 
      remote monitoring through wearable devices, ultimately enhancing clinical 
      outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has 
      revolutionized telemedicine by enabling the remote monitoring and management of 
      patient care. Nevertheless, the process of regeneration presents the difficulty 
      of effectively prioritizing the information of emergency patients in light of the 
      extensive amount of data generated by several integrated health care devices. The 
      main goal of this study is to be improving the procedure of prioritizing 
      emergency patients by implementing the Real-time Triage Optimization Framework 
      (RTOF), an innovative method that utilizes diverse data from the Internet of 
      Medical Things (IoMT). METHODS: The study's methodology utilized a variety of 
      Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) data, such as sensor data and texts derived 
      from electronic medical records. Tier 1 supplies sensor and textual data, and 
      Tier 3 imports textual data from electronic medical records. We employed our 
      methodologies to handle and examine data from a sample of 100,000 patients 
      afflicted with hypertension and heart disease, employing artificial intelligence 
      algorithms. We utilized five machine-learning algorithms to enhance the accuracy 
      of triage. RESULTS: The RTOF approach has remarkable efficacy in a simulated 
      telemedicine environment, with a triage accuracy rate of 98%. The Random Forest 
      algorithm exhibited superior performance compared to the other approaches under 
      scrutiny. The performance characteristics attained were an accuracy rate of 98%, 
      a precision rate of 99%, a sensitivity rate of 98%, and a specificity rate of 
      100%. The findings show a significant improvement compared to the present triage 
      methods. CONCLUSIONS: The efficiency of RTOF surpasses that of existing triage 
      frameworks, showcasing its significant ability to enhance the quality and 
      efficacy of telemedicine solutions. This work showcases substantial enhancements 
      compared to existing triage approaches, while also providing a scalable approach 
      to tackle hospital congestion and optimize resource allocation in real-time. The 
      results of our study emphasize the capacity of RTOF to mitigate hospital 
      overcrowding, expedite medical intervention, and enable the creation of adaptable 
      telemedicine networks. This study highlights potential avenues for further 
      investigation into the integration of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) with 
      machine learning to develop cutting-edge medical technologies.

AB  - In this study, Box-Behnken design combining seven factors at three levels were 
      used to optimize the elimination of CI Reactive Red 66 in artificial seawater, by 
      the combination of eco-friendly bio-sorbents and acclimated halotolerant 
      microbial strain. Results showed that macro-algae and cuttlebone (2 %) were the 
      best natural bio-sorbent. Additionally, the selected halotolerant strain able to 
      rapidly remove dye was identified as Shewanella algae B29. The optimization 
      process revealed that decolourization of CI Reactive Red 66 yields reached 
      91.04 % under the following variable values: dyes concentration (100 mg/l), 
      salinity (30 g/l), peptone (2 %), pH (5), algae C (3 %), cuttlebone (1.5 %) and 
      agitation (150 rpm). The whole genome analysis of S. algae B29 demonstrated the 
      presence of several genes coding for valuable enzymes involved in textile dyes 
      biotransformation, adaptation to stress as well as biofilm formation implying its 
      potential use in biological textile wastewater treatment.

TI  - A Knowledge-Based Algorithm for Automatic Monitoring of Orthodontic Treatment: 
      The Dental Monitoring System. Two Cases.
LID - 10.3390/s21051856 [doi]
LID - 1856
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the dental field, digital technology has created new opportunities 
      for orthodontists to integrate their clinical practice, and for patients to 
      collect information about orthodontics and their treatment, which is called 
      "teledentistry." Dental monitoring (DM) is a recently introduced orthodontic 
      application that combines safe teledentistry with artificial intelligence (AI) 
      using a knowledge-based algorithm, allowing an accurate semi-automatic monitoring 
      of the treatment. Dental Monitoring is the world's first SaaS (Software as a 
      Service) application designed for remote monitoring of dental treatment, 
      developed in Paris, France, with Philippe Salah as the Co-founder and CEO. CASES 
      PRESENTATION: This report describes two cases in which DM system was essential to 
      achieve the control of certain movements: it was possible to follow the movement, 
      even if complex, such as the anterior cross of an adult patient and a lack of 
      space in the canine of the growing patient. The software analyzed the fit and 
      retention of the aligner, thus ensuring correct biomechanics. They were treated 
      during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown with aligners. The first case is a growing 
      patient who was monitored during an interceptive orthodontic treatment to manage 
      a retained upper canine. The second case is an adult patient forced to finalize 
      his treatment of upper lateral incisor crossbite. The software analyzed the fit 
      and retention of the aligner, thus ensuring correct biomechanics. CONCLUSIONS: DM 
      system appears to be a promising method, useful for improving the interaction 
      between doctor and patient, generally acceptable and useful to patients, even in 
      critical clinical situations, at least in cases with optimal compliance and 
      ability to use the tool properly.

TI  - From Scalp to Ear-EEG: A Generalizable Transfer Learning Model for Automatic 
      Sleep Scoring in Older People.
PG  - 448-456
LID - 10.1109/JTEHM.2024.3388852 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Sleep monitoring has extensively utilized electroencephalogram (EEG) 
      data collected from the scalp, yielding very large data repositories and 
      well-trained analysis models. Yet, this wealth of data is lacking for emerging, 
      less intrusive modalities, such as ear-EEG. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: The current 
      study seeks to harness the abundance of open-source scalp EEG datasets by 
      applying models pre-trained on data, either directly or with minimal fine-tuning; 
      this is achieved in the context of effective sleep analysis from ear-EEG data 
      that was recorded using a single in-ear electrode, referenced to the ipsilateral 
      mastoid, and developed in-house as described in our previous work. Unlike 
      previous studies, our research uniquely focuses on an older cohort (17 subjects 
      aged 65-83, mean age 71.8 years, some with health conditions), and employs 
      LightGBM for transfer learning, diverging from previous deep learning approaches. 
      RESULTS: Results show that the initial accuracy of the pre-trained model on 
      ear-EEG was 70.1%, but fine-tuning the model with ear-EEG data improved its 
      classification accuracy to 73.7%. The fine-tuned model exhibited a statistically 
      significant improvement (p < 0.05, dependent t-test) for 10 out of the 13 
      participants, as reflected by an enhanced average Cohen's kappa score (a 
      statistical measure of inter-rater agreement for categorical items) of 0.639, 
      indicating a stronger agreement between automated and expert classifications of 
      sleep stages. Comparative SHAP value analysis revealed a shift in feature 
      importance for the N3 sleep stage, underscoring the effectiveness of the 
      fine-tuning process. CONCLUSION: Our findings underscore the potential of 
      fine-tuning pre-trained scalp EEG models on ear-EEG data to enhance 
      classification accuracy, particularly within an older population and using 
      feature-based methods for transfer learning. This approach presents a promising 
      avenue for ear-EEG analysis in sleep studies, offering new insights into the 
      applicability of transfer learning across different populations and computational 
      techniques. CLINICAL IMPACT: An enhanced ear-EEG method could be pivotal in 
      remote monitoring settings, allowing for continuous, non-invasive sleep quality 
      assessment in elderly patients with conditions like dementia or sleep apnea.

AB  - Pursuing high-performance conductive hydrogels is still hot topic in development 
      of advanced flexible wearable devices. Herein, a tough, self-healing, adhesive 
      double network (DN) conductive hydrogel (named as OSA-(Gelatin/PAM)-Ca, 
      O-(G/P)-Ca) was prepared by bridging gelatin and polyacrylamide network with 
      functionalized polysaccharide (oxidized sodium alginate, OSA) through Schiff base 
      reaction. Thanks to the presence of multiple interactions (Schiff base bond, 
      hydrogen bond, and metal coordination) within the network, the prepared hydrogel 
      showed outstanding mechanical properties (tensile strain of 2800 % and stress of 
      630 kPa), high conductivity (0.72 S/m), repeatable adhesion performance and 
      excellent self-healing ability (83.6 %/79.0 % of the original tensile 
      strain/stress after self-healing). Moreover, the hydrogel-based sensor exhibited 
      high strain sensitivity (GF = 3.66) and fast response time (<0.5 s), which can be 
      used to monitor a wide range of human physiological signals. Based on this, 
      excellent compression sensitivity (GF = 0.41 kPa(-1) in the range of 90-120 kPa), 
      a three-dimensional (3D) array of flexible sensor was designed to monitor the 
      intensity of pressure and spatial force distribution. In addition, a gel-based 
      wearable sensor was accurately classified and recognized ten types of gestures, 
      achieving an accuracy rate of >96.33 % both before and after self-healing under 
      three machine learning models (the decision tree, SVM, and KNN). This paper 
      provides a simple method to prepare tough and self-healing conductive hydrogel as 
      flexible multifunctional sensor devices for versatile applications in fields such 
      as healthcare monitoring, human-computer interaction, and artificial 
      intelligence.

TI  - The Effect of an AI-Based, Autonomous, Digital Health Intervention Using Precise 
      Lifestyle Guidance on Blood Pressure in Adults With Hypertension: Single-Arm 
      Nonrandomized Trial.
PG  - e51916

AB  - BACKGROUND: Home blood pressure (BP) monitoring with lifestyle coaching is 
      effective in managing hypertension and reducing cardiovascular risk. However, 
      traditional manual lifestyle coaching models significantly limit availability due 
      to high operating costs and personnel requirements. Furthermore, the lack of 
      patient lifestyle monitoring and clinician time constraints can prevent 
      personalized coaching on lifestyle modifications. OBJECTIVE: This study assesses 
      the effectiveness of a fully digital, autonomous, and artificial intelligence 
      (AI)-based lifestyle coaching program on achieving BP control among adults with 
      hypertension. METHODS: Participants were enrolled in a single-arm nonrandomized 
      trial in which they received a BP monitor and wearable activity tracker. Data 
      were collected from these devices and a questionnaire mobile app, which were used 
      to train personalized machine learning models that enabled precision lifestyle 
      coaching delivered to participants via SMS text messaging and a mobile app. The 
      primary outcomes included (1) the changes in systolic and diastolic BP from 
      baseline to 12 and 24 weeks and (2) the percentage change of participants in the 
      controlled, stage-1, and stage-2 hypertension categories from baseline to 12 and 
      24 weeks. Secondary outcomes included (1) the participant engagement rate as 
      measured by data collection consistency and (2) the number of manual clinician 
      outreaches. RESULTS: In total, 141 participants were monitored over 24 weeks. At 
      12 weeks, systolic and diastolic BP decreased by 5.6 mm Hg (95% CI -7.1 to -4.2; 
      P<.001) and 3.8 mm Hg (95% CI -4.7 to -2.8; P<.001), respectively. Particularly, 
      for participants starting with stage-2 hypertension, systolic and diastolic BP 
      decreased by 9.6 mm Hg (95% CI -12.2 to -6.9; P<.001) and 5.7 mm Hg (95% CI -7.6 
      to -3.9; P<.001), respectively. At 24 weeks, systolic and diastolic BP decreased 
      by 8.1 mm Hg (95% CI -10.1 to -6.1; P<.001) and 5.1 mm Hg (95% CI -6.2 to -3.9; 
      P<.001), respectively. For participants starting with stage-2 hypertension, 
      systolic and diastolic BP decreased by 14.2 mm Hg (95% CI -17.7 to -10.7; P<.001) 
      and 8.1 mm Hg (95% CI -10.4 to -5.7; P<.001), respectively, at 24 weeks. The 
      percentage of participants with controlled BP increased by 17.2% (22/128; P<.001) 
      and 26.5% (27/102; P<.001) from baseline to 12 and 24 weeks, respectively. The 
      percentage of participants with stage-2 hypertension decreased by 25% (32/128; 
      P<.001) and 26.5% (27/102; P<.001) from baseline to 12 and 24 weeks, 
      respectively. The average weekly participant engagement rate was 92% (SD 3.9%), 
      and only 5.9% (6/102) of the participants required manual outreach over 24 weeks. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates the potential of fully digital, autonomous, 
      and AI-based lifestyle coaching to achieve meaningful BP improvements and high 
      engagement for patients with hypertension while substantially reducing clinician 
      workloads. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT06337734;

AB  - Textile wastewater contains large quantities of azo dyes mixed with various 
      contaminants especially heavy metal ions. The discharge of effluents containing 
      methyl orange (MO) dye and Cu(2+) ions into water is harmful because they have 
      severe toxic effects to humans and the aquatic ecosystem. The dried algal biomass 
      was used as a sustainable, cost-effective and eco-friendly for the treatment of 
      the textile wastewater. Box-Behnken design (BBD) was used to identify the most 
      significant factors for achieving maximum biosorption of Cu(2+) and MO from 
      aqueous solutions using marine alga Fucus vesiculosus biomass. The experimental 
      results indicated that 3 g/L of F. vesiculosus biomass was capable of removing 
      92.76% of copper and 50.27% of MO simultaneously from aqueous solution using MO 
      (60 mg/L), copper (200 mg/L) at pH 7 within 60 min with agitation at 200 rpm. The 
      dry biomass was also investigated using SEM, EDS, and FTIR before and after MO 
      and copper biosorption. FTIR, EDS and SEM analyses revealed obvious changes in 
      the characteristics of the algal biomass as a result of the biosorption process. 
      The dry biomass of F. vesiculosus can eliminate MO and copper ions from aquatic 
      effluents in a feasible and efficient method.
