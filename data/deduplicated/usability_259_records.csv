We sought to assess the feasibility of self-telemonitoring with multiple devices including a handheld heart sound recorder and its association with clinical events in patients with HF. Methods: Ambulatory HF patients recorded their own heart sounds, mono‑lead electrocardiograms, oxygen saturation, body weight, and vital signs using multiple devices every morning for six months. Results: In the 77 patients enrolled (63 ± 13 years old, 84 % male), daily measurements were feasible with a self-measurement rate of >70 % of days in 75 % of patients. Younger age and higher Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire scores were independently associated with lower adherence (p = 0.002 and 0.027, respectively). A usability questionnaire showed that 87 % of patients felt self-telemonitoring was helpful, and 96 % could use the devices without routine cohabitant support. Six patients experienced ten HF events of re-hospitalization and/or unplanned hospital visits due to HF. In patients who experienced HF events, a significant increase in heart rate and diastolic blood pressure and a decrease in the time interval from Q wave onset to the second heart sound were observed 7 days before the events compared with those without HF events. Conclusions: Self-telemonitoring with multiple devices including a handheld heart sound recorder was feasible even in elderly patients with HF. This intervention may confer a sense of relief to patients and enable monitoring of physiological parameters that could be valuable in detecting the deterioration of HF."

Objective: The aim is to investigate the feasibility of smartphone-based assessments in aPwSMA and provide evidence on the reliability and construct validity of sensor-derived measures (SDMs) of mobility and manual dexterity collected remotely in aPwSMA. Methods: Data were collected from 59 aPwSMA (23 walkers, 20 sitters and 16 non-sitters) and 30 age-matched healthy controls (HC). SDMs were extracted from five smartphone-based tests capturing mobility and manual dexterity, which were administered in-clinic and remotely in daily life for four weeks. Reliability (Intraclass Correlation Coefficients, ICC) and construct validity (ability to discriminate between HC and aPwSMA and correlations with Revised Upper Limb Module, RULM and Hammersmith Functional Scale - Expanded HFMSE) were quantified for all SDMs. Results: The smartphone-based assessments proved feasible, with 92.1% average adherence in aPwSMA. The SDMs allowed to reliably assess both mobility and dexterity (ICC>0.75 for 14/22 SDMs). Twenty-one out of 22 SDMs significantly discriminated between HC and aPwSMA. The highest correlations with the RULM were observed for SDMs from the manual dexterity tests in both non-sitters (Typing, ρ=0.78) and sitters (Pinching, ρ=0.75). In walkers, the highest correlation was between mobility tests and HFMSE (5 U-Turns, ρ=0.79). Conclusions: This exploratory study provides preliminary evidence for the usability of smartphone-based assessments of mobility and manual dexterity in aPwSMA when deployed remotely in participants' daily life. Reliability and construct validity of SDMs remotely collected in real-life was demonstrated, which is a pre-requisite for their use in longitudinal trials. Additionally, three novel smartphone-based performance outcome assessments were successfully established for aPwSMA. Upon further validation of responsiveness to interventions, this technology holds potential to increase the efficiency of clinical trials in aPwSMA."

Whereas narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) is well characterized, other CDH disorders lack precise biomarkers. In SPHYNCS, we utilized Fitbit smartwatches to monitor physical activity, heart rate, and sleep parameters over 1 year. We examined the feasibility of long-term ambulatory monitoring using the wearable device. We then explored digital biomarkers differentiating patients with NT1 from healthy controls (HC). A total of 115 participants received a Fitbit smartwatch. Using a adherence metric to evaluate the usability of the wearable device, we found an overall adherence rate of 80% over 1 year. We calculated daily physical activity, heart rate, and sleep parameters from 2 weeks of greatest adherence to compare NT1 (n=20) and HC (n=9) participants. Compared to controls, NT1 patients demonstrated findings consistent with increased sleep fragmentation, including significantly greater wake-after-sleep onset (p=.007) and awakening index (p=.025), as well as standard deviation of time in bed (p=.044). Moreover, NT1 patients exhibited a significantly shorter REM latency (p=.019), and sleep latency (p=.001), as well as a lower peak heart rate (p=.008), heart rate standard deviation (p=.039) and high-intensity activity (p=.009) compared to HC. This ongoing study demonstrates the feasibility of long-term monitoring with wearable technology in patients with CDH and potentially identifies a digital biomarker profile for NT1. While further validation is needed in larger datasets, these data suggest that long-term wearable technology may play a future role in diagnosing and managing narcolepsy."

Literature suggests there is a technology adoption lag among older populations. We investigated if this lag was evident in geriatric virtual ward patients. Methods: Data from three NHS trusts using a virtual care platform (March 2021- August 2023) were aggregated to assess differences in perceived ease of use, technology adoption style, and measures of adherence. All patients received the Telehealth Usability Questionnaire Ease of Use (EOU) subsection (higher scores indicate higher EOU). Patients completed surveys via tablet, wore monitoring devices, and took blood pressure readings. We dichotomised age (<75 vs. 75+) and used Fisher's exact and Wilcoxon-Mann- Whitney tests. Results: Of 857 patients, 36.9% were geriatric (mean age 81.5 years). The younger group (mean age 59.1 years) had 541 patients. Gender was evenly split between age groups (p = 0.62). Median EOU scores were 5.5 (geriatric) and 6.2 (younger) (p<0.001). Geriatric patients were more likely to avoid or delay technology adoption (82% vs. 56% in younger patients, p<0.001). Geriatric patients had higher adherence to the wearable device (median 95.3%) compared to younger patients (93.3%, p<0.001). Blood pressure (median 81.6%) and survey adherence (median 83.3%) did not significantly differ between groups (p = 0.076, p = 0.0501). Conclusions: Despite perceptions and literature suggesting older patients are less comfortable with technology, our findings demonstrate high engagement in virtual ward technology. While differences exist in technology adoption and EOU scores, geriatric patients exhibit equal or higher adherence to remote monitoring tasks. These results challenge stereotypes and underscore the importance of incorporating technology in geriatric care."

Our work presents an easy blade-coating method for fabricating flexible ACEL display devices based on an all-solution process. By dispersing BaTiO3 and ZnS/Cu powder into waterborne polyurethane, we successfully combined dielectric and fluorescence functionalities within a single layer, significantly reducing the device's driving voltage. Additionally, the ionic conducting hydrogel was chosen as a transparent electrode to achieve good electrical contact and strong interfacial adhesion through in situ polymerization. Owing to the unique method, our ACEL device exhibits high flexibility, low driving voltage (20-100 V), high brightness (300+ cd/m2 at 60 V), and environmental friendliness. Furthermore, by repurposing the hydrogel electrode, we integrated strain visualization capabilities within a single device, highlighting its potential for applications such as wearable healthcare monitoring."

This could lead to inaccurate data when an exam is completed without clinical supervision, with the consequence that incorrect data lead to improper treatment. Upon further analysis of the existing literature, the RPM Usability Impact model is introduced. The goal is to guide researchers and device manufacturers to increase the usability of wearable and home-use medical devices in the future.

Aims: This study investigates the transitional care program experience facilitating early discharges in a pediatric setting through the use of an easy-to-use mobile medical device (TytoCare™, TytoCare Ltd., Natanya, Israel). Outcomes: This study aims to assess the effectiveness of telehomecare in achieving complete resolution of diseases without readmission, compare the length of stay between intervention and standard care groups, and gather user and professional experiences. Methods: A randomized open-label, controlled pilot study enrolled 102 children, randomly assigned to the telehomecare (TELE) group (n = 51, adopting early hospital discharge with continued home monitoring) or the standard-of-care (STAND) group (n = 51). Primary outcomes include complete disease resolution without readmission. Secondary objectives include recording a shorter length of stay in the intervention group. Surveys on user and professional experiences were conducted. A group of 51 children declining telemedicine services (NO-TELE) was also included. Results: In the TELE group, 100% of children achieved complete disease resolution without readmission, with a median duration of stay of 4 days, significantly shorter than the 7 days in the STAND group (p = 0.01). The telemedicine system demonstrated efficient performance and high satisfaction levels. The NO-TELE group showed no significant differences in demographics or digital technology competence. Perceived benefits of telemedicine included time and cost savings, reduced hospital stays, and technology utility and usability. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that user-friendly mobile medical devices effectively facilitate early hospital discharges in a pediatric setting. These devices serve as a bridge between home and hospital, optimizing care pathways."

A review of the literature illustrates, however, that poor device usability can impact the generated data when using Patient-Generated Health Data (PGHD) devices, such as wearables or home use medical devices, when used outside a health facility. The Pi-CON methodology is introduced to overcome these challenges and guide the definition of user-friendly and intuitive devices in the future. Pi-CON stands for passive, continuous, and non-contact, and describes the ability to acquire health data, such as vital signs, continuously and passively with limited user interaction and without attaching any sensors to the patient. The paper highlights the advantages of Pi-CON by leveraging various sensors and techniques, such as radar, remote photoplethysmography, and infrared. It illustrates potential concerns and discusses future applications Pi-CON could be used for, including gait and fall monitoring by installing an omnipresent sensor based on the Pi-CON methodology. This would allow automatic data collection once a person is recognized, and could be extended with an integrated gateway so multiple cameras could be installed to enable data feeds to a cloud-based interface, allowing clinicians and family members to monitor patient health status remotely at any time."

Wearables can be useful for evaluating falls, fatigue, sedentary behavior, exercise, and sleep quality in people with MS (PwMS). Objective: This scoping review of relevant literature explores studies investigating the perceptions of patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs) about the use of wearable technologies in the management of MS. Methods: The Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for scoping reviews was used. The search strategy was applied to the databases, MEDLINE via Ovid, Embase, APA PsycInfo, and CINAHL. Further searches were performed in IEEE, Scopus, and Web of Science. The review considered studies reporting quantitative or qualitative data on perceptions and experiences of PwMS and HCPs concerning wearables’ usability, satisfaction, barriers, and facilitators. Results: 10 studies were included in this review. Wearables’ usefulness and accessibility, ease of use, awareness, and motivational tool potential were patient-perceived facilitators of use. Barriers related to anxiety and frustration, complexity, and the design of wearables. Perceived usefulness and system requirements are identified as facilitators of using wearables by HCPs, while data security concerns and fears of increased workload and limited effectiveness in the care plan are identified as barriers to use wearables. Conclusions: This review contributes to our understanding of the benefits of wearable technologies in MS by exploring perceptions of both PwMS and HCPs. The scoping review provided a broad overview of facilitators and barriers to wearable use in MS. There is a need for further studies underlined with sound theoretical frameworks to provide a robust evidence-base for the optimal use of wearables to empower healthcare users and providers."

The viscoelastic strain of stretchable materials often results in nonlinear stress-strain characteristics over a broad range of strains, consequently making the stretchable sensors at the body joints less accurate in predicting and recognizing human gestures. Accurate recognition of human gestures can be further deteriorated by environmental changes such as temperature and humidity. Here, we demonstrated an environment-adaptable high stress-strain linearity (up to ε = 150%) and high-durability (>100,000 cycles) stretchable sensor conformally laminated onto the body joints for human gesture recognition. The serpentine configuration of our ionic liquid-based stretchable film enabled us to construct broad data sets of mechanical strain and temperature changes for machine learning-based gesture recognition. Signal recognition and training of distinct strains and environmental stimuli using a machine learning-based algorithm analysis successfully measured and predicted the joint motion in a temperature-changing environment with an accuracy of 92.86% (R-squared). Therefore, we believe that our serpentine-shaped ion gel-based stretchable sensor harmonized with machine-learning analysis will be a significant achievement toward environmentally adaptive and multianalyte sensing applications. Our proposed machine learning-enabled multisensor system may enable the development of future electronic devices such as wearable electronics, soft robotics, electronic skin, and human-machine interaction systems."

Methods: We analyzed the data of the “Bringing Parkinson Care Back Home” study, a 1-year observational cohort study in 200 PwP with a fall history. User experience, compliance, and reasons for noncompliance were described. Multiple Cox regression models were used to identify determinants of 1-year compliance. Results: We included 200 PwP (mean age: 69 years, 37% women), of whom 116 (58%) completed the 1-year study. The main reasons for dropping out of the study were technical problems (61 of 118 reasons). Median wear time of the smartwatch was 17.5 h/day. The online dashboard was used by 77% of participants to report falls. Smartphone possession, shorter disease duration, more severe motor symptoms, and less-severe freezing and balance problems, but not age and gender, were associated with a higher likelihood of 1-year compliance. Conclusions: The 1-year compliance with this specific smartwatch was moderate, and the user experience was generally good, except battery life and data transfer.

Insights from previous experiments on usability and added value of sensors will be used to improve successive experiments. During each experiment, multiple participants (clients with dementia and CBs) are monitored with both ambient and wearable sensors. For the second research question a qualitative approach is employed, using focus groups (FG) and consensus methods. These FGs will be held amongst nursing staff who are involved in daily care tasks for people with dementia. Subsequently, consensus methods are used to align behavioral descriptors/labels. Results: early findings will be presented at the symposium Discussion: Within this project we expect to find precursors of challenging behavior in a personalized fashion based on nurse's expert knowledge and sensor data. In order to develop a monitoring system that can be embedded within NH's, real-time alarming, in-situ behavior recognition and trustworthiness are part of our technological requirements. Just-intime interventions may then be deployed to prevent behavior escalation or the persistence of undesirable situations."

More than half of patients with cancer who receive cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or immunotherapies experience deleterious side effects such as febrile neutropenia, infection, neurotoxicity, and cytokine release syndrome. Early intervention and treatment for these side effects can help avoid complications and improve outcomes, but delays in treatment administration are common as most outpatient management approaches depend on patient self-assessment and patient-initiated pursuit of follow-up care. Remote patient monitoring through digital health technologies offers the opportunity to bridge this gap without imposing undue burden on either patients or healthcare providers. This feasibility study assessed the results of a technology-assisted in-home oncology care program to remotely monitor bone marrow transplant and CAR T-cell therapy patients and provide early intervention for symptomatic episodes needing clinical management. The program also offered support for patients to obtain routine lab draws, hydration, antiemetics, intravenous antibiotics, and a provider assessment at home. Technical and operational feasibility were evaluated together with perceived user experience among patients, caregivers, and providers. Methods. Ten patients between 18-89 years old participated in the study for up to 90 days following allogeneic bone marrow transplant and up to 30 days following CAR T-cell therapy or autologous bone marrow transplant. Patients used continuous-wear biometric sensors for passive vital sign monitoring around the clock seven days per week and engaged with a chatbot by SMS text for health status checks and symptom reporting. Scheduled home care was administered by licensed home health providers. Virtual care center personnel evaluated patient status based on wearable data and patient messaging and followed up directly with patients or engaged patients' treating clinicians for notification and management of urgent issues as needed. Patients and caregivers were asked to complete surveys about their experience with and perceptions of the program at midpoint and study completion, while providers were asked to complete end-of-study surveys to capture their perspectives across all patients. Patients were also asked to participate in brief interviews at study midpoint and at the end of the study. Interim Results. Eighty percent of patients participated in the program as intended through wearing devices and responding to engagement prompts. Wearable sensors detected a total of 184 outpatient alerts from patients between April and July 2023, of which 57 led to follow up with patients, 12 required further follow up with the clinical care team, and 5 required follow up care in a clinical setting due to elevated temperature or respiratory rate. Sixty percent of patients responded more than 50% of the time to requested health assessment surveys. Patient engagement with the chatbot and symptom reporting system led to 48 events needing virtual care team follow up, of which 20 were to answer patient questions and 28 were in response to reports of concerning symptoms. A total of 11 events were further referred by the virtual care team to the clinical care team, of which 5 required follow up care in a clinical setting. Study data collection will complete in August 2023. Initial Conclusions. Technology-assisted remote patient monitoring is feasible for use with bone marrow transplant and CAR T-cell therapy patients at home. Successful integration with clinical practice settings requires tailoring to existing workflows. Further assessment of patient acceptance for short-term versus long-term monitoring is recommended."

Objectives/Aims: Aim of this pilot study within the H2020 project ALAMEDA-Bridging the Early Diagnosis and Treatment Gaps of Brain Diseases was to develop an integrated platform collecting patient-centred data from wearables and mobile devices through digital patient-reported outcomes (ePRO) and to test the toolkit's feasibility and usability in people with MS (PwMS). Methods: Data collection has been defined according to MULTIACT shared decisions model involving all relevant stakeholders in the selection of outcomes. These included physical parameters continuously recorded by a smartwatch; ePRO on mobility, cognitive functions, emotional status, daily life and sleep quality periodically administered to users through a smartphone App. Pseudonymised data were stored on the cloud and made accessible to healthcare professionals and researchers using a dashboard. The percentage of completed over scheduled ePRO was calculated as a feasibility outcome. Usability of the toolkit was measured with the System Usability Scale (SUS). Results: 20 PwMS (14 females; age=37.8±6.0 years; all relapsingremitting MS; disease duration=9.1±6.8 years; EDSS=2.2±1.3) were included and asked to use the ALAMEDA toolkit for one year. Half of them reached the 6-month milestone. Users correctly completed 53% of the scheduled ePRO and regularly wore the smartwatch without discomfort. Values of generated data are in line with those reported by the literature (Daily steps=8415±3028; daily minutes of vigorous / moderate / light activity=9.8±9.4 / 14.5±11.7 / 268.7±68.9; daily sedentary minutes=705.1±117.6; Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale-12=37.2±15.7; Arm function in Multiple Sclerosis Questionnaire=47.4±20.4; Perceived Deficit Questionnaire= 25.2±16.4; Beck Anxiety Inventory=17.3±16.0; Modified Fatigue Impact Scale=18.5±14.5; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index=25.2±16.4). SUS revealed high levels of confidence using the system and very high intention to use it in the future. Conclusion: The ALAMEDA toolkit seems feasible and usable to remotely monitor multiple domains of health status in PwMS. Further analysis on the dataset, including Artificial Intelligence and machine learning algorithms, may allow predicting relevant changes throughout the course of MS and anticipating the therapeutic intervention."

Remote monitoring could help inform patient symptomatology, raise evidence on disease burden and support treatment decisions by clinicians. NMOSDCopilot, a Software as a Medical Device (SaMD), was developed to answer these needs. It includes a mobile application intended to be used at home by patients, composed of active tests (to self-assess motor, cognitive, vision, dexterity functions) and e-questionnaires. A web portal is available for clinicians to access patient results. In line with the guidelines for the development of SaMD, user involvement during development is critical, which is why NMOSDCopilot was designed in collaboration with patients and clinicians. Usability engineering techniques were used to identify and mitigate factors that could contribute to human errors and adverse events. Objectives/Aims: To demonstrate the compliance of the NMOSDCopilot patient interface, two usability studies were conducted with NMOSD patients. Methods: Two usability remote studies were conducted among French patients: a user improvement (formative study; N=5) followed by a user validation study (summative study; N=12). All patients were recruited through a patient advocacy group in France. During the formative study, patients tested prototypes with 4 e-active tests (Cognition, Dexterity, Endurance, Perimeter). User behaviour, perceived ease of use, readability and satisfaction were collected and evaluated on a 7-point Likert scale. During the summative study, patients used NMOSDCopilot active tests and quality of life e-questionnaires (Pain Visual Analogue Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire-8). Success rate and perceived ease of use were analysed. Results: The formative study showed that the active tests were perceived as very easy (mean=6.7/7, SD=0.35) and satisfying to use (mean=6.7/7, SD=0.20). The cognition test was perceived as being readable (mean=6.6/7, SD=0.89). The identified areas of improvement were addressed during NMOSDCopilot development. Except for the Vision test, the summative study showed that NMOSDCopilot was perceived as being very easy to use, with a success rate of use of 100% for all the tested features. Conclusion: Overall, NMOSDCopilot patient interface was validated among French patients and will also be tested by American patients. Its clinical performance will be validated in OPTIS, a prospective multicenter clinical study."

While many healthcare professionals (HCPs) in the field agree that digital tools can standardize and improve MS care, adoption in the clinical routine has proven to be challenging. Objectives/Aims: Therefore, it is key to understand the value digital tools bring to care teams and the potential hurdles for the widespread adoption of these innovative solutions. Methods: We report on the clinical adoption of icompanion, a digital medical device solution that combines remote clinical monitoring with MRI insights. We share lessons learned and describe the efforts to improve patient retention, clinical visit efficiency, fit into clinical workflow, and data representation for care teams. In addition, we report insights from user interviews with HCPs and results from design validation tests for the novel icompanion HCP portal (including System Usability Scale). Results: icompanion is currently being used in 18 hospitals in 6 countries, and used by over 5700 people with MS. Average 3-month retention of patients (using icompanion without their care team) is 58%. Design validation for the novel HCP portal is underway and will be reported from 10-15 HCPs. The user interviews with 13 HCPs suggested that the most crucial factors for clinical adoption were (1) integration into electronic medical records (EMRs) (2) improving clinical visit efficiency (3) helping patients be better prepared for a visit (4) having an instant overview of clinical and MRI biomarkers from patients. Conclusion: Based on this data, the integration of digital health solutions in the clinical workflow (and EMR) is the most important driver for clinical adoption. Most HCPs see a clear value in access to remote monitoring data for patient management, but it is crucial that these solutions improve workflows as well."

Decentralized trials and digital health solutions have been suggested as potential solutions and have certainly risen to the challenge during the pandemic. Clinical trial designs are now increasingly data driven. The use of distributed clinical data networks and digitization has helped to fundamentally upgrade existing research systems. A trial design may vary anywhere from fully decentralized to hybrid to traditional on-site. Various decentralization components are available for stakeholders to increase the reach and pace of their trials, such as electronic informed consent, remote interviews, administration, outcome assessment, monitoring, and laboratory and imaging modalities. Furthermore, digital health technologies can be included to enrich study conduct. However, careful consideration is warranted, including assessing verification and validity through usability studies and having various contingencies in place through dedicated risk assessment. Selecting the right combination depends not just on the ability to handle patient care and the medical know-how but also on the availability of appropriate technologic infrastructure, skills, and human resources. Throughout this process, quality of evidence generation and physician-patient relation must not be undermined. Here we also address some knowledge gaps, cost considerations, and potential impact of decentralization and digitization on inclusivity, recruitment, engagement, and retention. Last, we mention some future directions that may help drive the necessary change in the right direction."

However, their role in remote monitoring of the patients' PAs in telemedicine needs to be adequately explored. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the correlation between a participant's actual daily step counts and the daily step counts reported by their smartphone. In addition, we inquired about the usability of smartphones for collecting PA data. METHODS: This prospective observational study was conducted among patients undergoing lower limb orthopedic surgery and a group of nonpatients as control. The data from the patients were collected from 2 weeks before surgery until 4 weeks after the surgery, whereas the data collection period for the nonpatients was 2 weeks. The participant's daily step count was recorded by PA trackers worn 24/7. In addition, a smartphone app collected the number of daily steps registered by the participants' smartphones. We compared the cross-correlation between the daily steps time series obtained from the smartphones and PA trackers in different groups of participants. We also used mixed modeling to estimate the total number of steps, using smartphone step counts and the characteristics of the patients as independent variables. The System Usability Scale was used to evaluate the participants' experience with the smartphone app and the PA tracker. RESULTS: Overall, 1067 days of data were collected from 21 patients (n=11, 52% female patients) and 10 nonpatients (n=6, 60% female patients). The median cross-correlation coefficient on the same day was 0.70 (IQR 0.53-0.83). The correlation in the nonpatient group was slightly higher than that in the patient group (median 0.74, IQR 0.60-0.90 and median 0.69, IQR 0.52-0.81, respectively). The likelihood ratio tests on the models fitted by mixed effects methods demonstrated that the smartphone step count was positively correlated with the PA tracker's total number of steps (χ21=34.7, P<.001). In addition, the median usability score for the smartphone app was 78 (IQR 73-88) compared with median 73 (IQR 68-80) for the PA tracker. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the ubiquity, convenience, and practicality of smartphones, the high correlation between the smartphones and the total daily step count time series highlights the potential usefulness of smartphones in detecting changes in the number of steps in remote monitoring of a patient's PA."

Direct left-sided haemodynamic sensors offer theoretical benefits beyond pulmonary artery pressure monitoring systems. We evaluated the safety, usability, and performance of a novel left atrial pressure (LAP) monitoring system in HF patients. Methods and results: The VECTOR-HF study (NCT03775161) was a first-in-human, prospective, multicentre, single-arm, clinical trial enrolling 30 patients with HF. The device consisted of an interatrial positioned leadless sensor, able to transmit LAP data wirelessly. After 3 months, a right heart catheterization was performed to correlate mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) with simultaneous mean LAP obtained from the device. Remote LAP measurements were then used to guide patient management. The miniaturized device was successfully implanted in all 30 patients, without acute major adverse cardiac and neurological events (MACNE). At 3 months, freedom from short-term MACNE was 97%. Agreement between sensor-calculated LAP and PCWP was consistent, with a mean difference of −0.22 ± 4.92 mmHg, the correlation coefficient and the Lin's concordance correlation coefficient values were equal to 0.79 (p < 0.0001) and 0.776 (95% confidence interval 0.582–0.886), respectively.

However, some chronic pain patients are inconsistent with their patterns of wearable device use, charging, and responding to digital surveys. This clinical study examines whether patients will engage more regularly with these digital tools when provided with personalized feedback and targeted messaging regarding pain and common comorbidities via an entertaining user experience. Methods: This is a prospective, longitudinal, dual-arm clinical trial designed to enroll 28 patients into two study arms (14 patients per arm). In the traditional study arm, patients are provided with a remote monitoring smartphone application and wearable physiologic sensors. In the personalized experience study arm, patients are provided with these same tools, but are given a version of the remote monitoring app that provides a simple personalized user experience including engaging dialog, stories, targeted education related to chronic pain, and feedback on their health and holistic well-being. Patient engagement is measured by the consistency with which patients engage with the application, respond to therapy-related surveys, and use their wearable device properly. The interim analysis included in this report consists of the available survey data from five initial subjects in the traditional study arm before and during the SCS trial period. Enrollment of the first patient in the personalized experience arm occurred in July 2022 and follow-up and analysis are ongoing. Results: Three of five interviewed subjects wanted to be able to view their wearable data daily, while the other two subjects preferred to view them weekly. Subjects preferred using the Oura™ Ring and Apple Watch® due to their comfort and ease of use. Subjects also preferred the weekly recharging of the Oura ring (vs. daily watch charging). Conclusions: This research seeks to demonstrate feasibility for using patient-centric app design and artificial intelligence to improve user engagement with digital therapies in the field of chronic pain. We hypothesize that patients will be more engaged with use of digital tools if they are provided with an engaging and simple user experience that interests them and educates them regarding their chronic pain and related well-being topics. Chronic pain is a multi-dimensional disorder that can impact patient physical, social, and mental well-being [1]. Ongoing research should investigate whether digital education can also be used concurrently with neuromodulation to motivate patients to make positive lifestyle changes that are synergistic with their SCS therapy.

Distance monitoring via patient reported outcomes (PROs) and wearables are used to assess treatment efficacy. In combination with remote vital sign measurement and tele-nursing, remote care may also increase safety and save resources. However, it is unclear how such telemedicine services integrate into the clinical workflow. Objectives: Feasibility and User Experience (UX) study of a combined appbased and nurse-assisted tele-monitoring program in rheumatic patients with different risk profiles starting a new biologic treatment. Methods: In this quantitative and qualitative study, we explored a distance monitoring service including contactless optical vital sign measurement and tele-nursing in ambulatory rheumatic patients in Switzerland. System Usability Scores (SUS) and semi-structured interviews were performed with patients, tele-nurses, and rheumatologists. Patients collected weekly PROs and vital signs via an app (Vtuls, Switzerland) after instruction by tele-nurses. Vital sign deterioration triggered automated notification (categorized in yellow, green, and red) allowing corrective actions. Rheumatologists received monthly summaries of PRO and vital signs in PDF form. Results: 15 patients with rheumatoid arthritis or spondylarthritis with a mean age of 43.9 years (32-79) were included and monitored up to three months with the app and phone calls of the tele-nurse. 15/15 patients found the program useful, mainly for staying in contact with their rheumatologist after therapy start or switch. 13/15 patients measured their vital signs regularly, the adherence to PRO questionnaires was significantly lower. 6 patients had technical problems with the contactless blood pressure measurement. The app generated in average 16 vital sign alarms per patient, of those 7.1 green, 1.1 yellow and 2.2 red alarms. The rheumatologists considered the program as useful, especially in one patient with high-level comorbidity who experienced infection and in another patient after dosing error of the new treatment. The number of consultations (e.g. routine control 1-2 months after starting the new treatment) were significantly lower in this cohort compared to patients without remote care. PDF reports via email were considered as suboptimal and digital integration into the workflow needs to be implemented in future versions of the care program. Tele-nurses considered patients with high comorbidity, shorter disease duration and younger age as most suitable for remote control. False alarms initially increased the workload of the nurses, but this later reduced through technical advice and adjustment of the thresholds. SUS scores were slightly higher in patients (median 97.5) compared to tele-nurses (median 77.5). One patient outlier (17.5) had higher expectations in the responsiveness of tele-nursing, based on entered PROs. Conclusion: Tight remote control of safety and efficacy through a combined app, biosensor and tele-nursing program was appreciated by all stakeholders, especially in patients with high comorbidity. A better integration of data and communication in the clinical workflow is required, ideally through the electronic medical record. A reduced workload in the rheumatology clinic was observed, but a complete reorganization of the processes was necessary."

ON TRAX [NCT04381494] was a prospective pilot study aimed to evaluate the potential benefit of using a multiparametric remote monitoring system to detect early signs of pneumonitis in patients with Stage III NSCLC receiving standard of care durvalumab post-chemoradiotherapy. Here we report learnings from this pilot based on post-hoc analyses comparing changes in device adherence, study retention and user experience after upgrading the wearable device mid-study. Methods: Patients were monitored remotely while on durvalumab, for up to 1 year, with an FDA-cleared system (Current Health) that recorded vital signs continuously (SpO2, respiratory rate, pulse, temperature and motion). During the study, the wearable was upgraded from Generation One (G1) to Two (G2), a smaller and lighter (30 vs 115 grams) device with same capabilities. We compared daily device adherence (defined as median number of hours with wearable data transmission per 24h expressed as %) and total study participation time (days) for G1 vs G2 users by Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test. At end-of-study visit, some patients rated on a 5-point Likert scale three statements regarding comfort of wearable, intrusiveness, and overall experience. Results: Following IRB approvals, 40 patients from 16 US sites were enrolled, but only 39 patients with minimum of 1h of wearable data transmitted were included in this analysis. Nine patients used only G1, 22 only G2, while 8 used both. Collectively, the 39 patients transmitted 76,957 hours of data. The median (interquartile range) length of participation was 84 (47-208) days. Transitioning from G1 to G2 did not affect daily device adherence (G1: 79 (46-96) vs G2: 75 (58-100) %, p = 0.9), but patients using G2 exclusively participated 34 days longer than those using G1 exclusively (47 (2-57) vs 81 (50-161) days, p = 0.03). Seventeen patients responded to the user experience survey, of which 13 used only one device (G1 = 3, G2 = 10). Ten of 10 (100%) G2 users 'agreed'/'strongly agreed' that the wearable was comfortable, while 2 out of 3 of G1 users 'disagreed'. Both groups 'agreed'/'strongly agreed' it did not impede their daily activities. Overall experience was 'good'/'excellent' for 9 of 10 (90%) G2 users, but varied in G1 users (1 'good', 1 'neutral', 1 'poor'). Conclusions: Following the introduction of a smaller and lighter wearable device, patients remained a median 34 days longer in this digital health pilot study and reported greater comfort and better overall experience, however the pilot was terminated early. In light of technological updates, researchers must balance consistency with data yield and patient experience. An interim review of technology and its implementation into study protocols is recommended."

Currently, there is no available wearable sensor to accurately capture pulmonary function remotely in the home, especially in children. 'Leo' is a novel Band-Aid sized wearable patch that uses impedance pneumography to measure respiratory parameters. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and performance of Leo compared to gold standard pneumotachography (PNT) in estimating respiratory rate, volume and flow. Methods: Twenty-six children with stable asthma ages 3-18 years were enrolled. The Leo device was placed over the mid-sternum. Participants breathed through a PNT device (Hans Rudolph, USA) to simultaneously capture respiratory rate, volume and flow while changing tidal volume in sitting, supine and lateral positions. Assessment duration was 10-15 minutes in each position and the measurements were also repeated 15 minutes after albuterol administration. The agreement between respiratory volume and flow waveform was assessed using standard error of the mean (SEM) and for respiratory rate using Pearson correlation coefficient. Participants completed a usability questionnaire. Results: Twenty two of the 26 recruited participants were included in the final respiratory analysis (mean age 10.2±4.3 years; 19 boys). Reasons for exclusion: excessive movement (2) and unable to adequately follow instructions (2). Respiratory rates median 19.7 (range 5-40) breaths/minute (bpm) and tidal volumes median 280 (range 100 - 3500) mL. The agreement of respiratory flow and volume was strong in all body postures and tidal volumes (mean ρ>0.95-0.85). The agreement between the PNT-derived and Leo-derived tidal volume estimates was also strong when Leo values were calibrated per subject and posture (r = 0.96, limits of agreement ± 0.2 Litres). Respiratory rates measured by Leo and PNT were highly correlated. (r = 0.98, limits of agreement ±1.5 breaths per minute). Twenty-two (85%) participants reported “very slight redness” at the skin site after Leo removal, and one reported “well-defined redness”. Otherwise, no other adverse events were reported. Participants reported a mean score of 3.6±0.63 (out of 5) for comfort (5 being very comfortable). Conclusions: These results suggest that Leo is a highly accurate and safe wearable sensor for respiratory monitoring in children with asthma. Further studies are needed to evaluate the clinical utility of Leo as a remote monitoring tool to assess pulmonary function."

The COVID pandemic has highlighted the potential safety benefits of post-discharge RPM in the ED, especially in remote/rural settings. This study aimed to determine the feasibility characteristics of smartwatches in health status tracking for post-COVID patients. Measures and Design: This prospective feasibility trial enrolled patients rehabilitating at home from acute COVID in remote/rural Alberta. Patients were asked to wear a Fitbit Charge 2 device continuously and device metrics were extracted for analysis (e.g. heart rate, sleep, and activity). Electronic patient reported outcome measures (e-PROMS) for mental (bi-weekly) and physical (daily) health were collected via SMS text and email. Exit surveys and semistructured interviews evaluated the patient experience. The primary outcome was proportion of time (study-hours) with usable heart rate data. Secondary measures included completion rate for e-PROMs, patient satisfaction, patient-perceived clinical utility and mental health impacts. Evaluation/results: Of 17 eligible patients, 11 agreed to participate. The mean age was 52 yrs and 73% were female. Five patients (45%) were hospitalized (avg. stay 41 days) and 4 required mechanical ventilation; 6 already owned a smartwatch. The most prominent physical symptoms were fatigue, muscle weakness, headache, and dyspnea. On average, patients had moderate to severe anxiety (GAD 7 = 15.8), depression (PHQ-9 = 19.9), and stress (PSS = 26.6). A total of 21,040 patient-hours were monitored, averaging 1913 hrs per patient (SD = 1396). Heart rate data was usable for 83% of studyhours. Surveys were completed 83% and 72% of the time for mental and physical health, respectively. Survey scores were favorable for usability/acceptability (3.9/7), perceived clinical utility (3.5/7) and mental health impacts (3.8/7). Interviews revealed overall positive patient experience with varying concerns about data privacy/security. Discussion/impact: Smartwatches are feasible tools for RPM, especially given their usability, affordability, and patient acceptance. We will present preliminary estimates for longitudinal associations between smartwatch parameters and e-PROMS. Future work will aim to develop tools for predicting and preventing ED visits/revisits with continuously collected smartwatch data and machine learning."

While there are a few examples of non-flexible sensors available, the management of electronic waste generated from such sensors is critical. Most of such available sensors are rigid in form factor and hence limit their usability in healthcare monitoring due to their poor conformity to human skin. Combining these facets, studies on the development of a recyclable cross-talk free flexible sensor for monitoring human motions and active parameters are far and few. In this work, we report on the development of a recyclable flexible sensor that can provide accurate data for detecting small changes in strain as well as pressure. The developed sensor could decipher the signals individually responsible due to strain as well as pressure. Hence, it can deliver a cross-talk free output. Thermoplastic polyurethane and graphene were selected as the model system. The thermoplastic polyurethane/graphene sensor exhibited a tensile strain sensitivity of GF ≃ 3.375 for 0-100% strain and 10.551 for 100-150% strain and a pressure sensitivity of ∼-0.25 kPa-1. We demonstrate the applicability of the strain sensor for monitoring a variety of human motions ranging from a very small strain of eye blinking to a large strain of elbow bending with unambiguous peaks and a very fast response and recovery time of 165 ms. The signals received are mostly electrical hysteresis free. To confirm the recyclability, the developed sensor was recycled up to three times. Marginal decrement in the sensitivity was noted with recycling without compromising the sensing capabilities. These findings promise to open up a new avenue for developing flexible sensors with lesser carbon footprints."

Nevertheless, RPM research integrating multisensory home monitoring in LTRs is scarce. We developed a novel multisensory home monitoring device and tested it in the context of COVID-19 vaccinations. We hypothesize that multisensory RPM and smartphone-based questionnaire feedback on signs and symptoms will be well accepted among LTRs. To assess the usability and acceptability of a remote monitoring system consisting of wearable devices, including home spirometry and a smartphone-based questionnaire application for symptom and vital sign monitoring using wearable devices, during the first and second SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Materials and Methods: Observational usability pilot study for six weeks of home monitoring with the COVIDA Desk for LTRs. During the first week after the vaccination, intensive monitoring was performed by recording data on physical activity, spirometry, temperature, pulse oximetry and self-reported symptoms, signs and additional measurements. During the subsequent days, the number of monitoring assessments was reduced. LTRs reported on their perceptions of the usability of the monitoring device through a purpose-designed questionnaire. Results: Ten LTRs planning to receive the first COVID-19 vaccinations were recruited. For the intensive monitoring study phase, LTRs recorded symptoms, signs and additional measurements. The most frequent adverse events reported were local pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance and headache. The duration of these symptoms was 5-8 days post-vaccination. Adherence to the main monitoring devices was high. LTRs rated usability as high. The majority were willing to continue monitoring. Conclusions: The COVIDA Desk showed favorable technical performance and was well accepted by the LTRs during the vaccination phase of the pandemic. The feasibility of the RPM system deployment was proven by the rapid recruitment uptake, technical performance (i.e., low number of errors), favorable user experience questionnaires and detailed individual user feedback."

Here, we present a foldable supercapacitor with affordable flexibility by adopting a developed design and electrode material system as a way to extend usability. Notably, to resolve the limited energy density of conventional capacitors, we successfully synthesize the CoO/NiCo-layered double hydroxide (LDH) core–shell nanostructure on Ni framework as a cathode material. Further, glucose-based activated carbon (GBAC) is utilized for the anode. The CoO/NiCo-LDH electrodes exhibited a high specific capacitance of ∼284.8 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1, and GBAC delivers a high specific capacitance of ∼166 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. In the following, the combinatorial integration of these materials enabled the asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) to increase the energy density by enhancing the capacitance and the voltage window, in which a hydrogel-based electrolyte was facilitated for the foldable and wearable capability. The energy density of the ASC device was ∼24.9 Wh kg−1 at a power density of ∼779.5 W kg−1 with a voltage window of ∼1.6 V. As demonstrated, a self-powered energy source was demonstrated by a serially connected multi-ASC device with a help of a commercial solar cell, which was employed for powering wearable healthcare monitoring devices, including personal alarms for patients and recording the human body's electrical signals. The present work offers a viable approach to preparing potential candidates for high-performance electrodes of supercapacitors with deformable configurations to extend the powering capability of other electronic devices with physical functionalities used in wearable electronics."

We tested a smart offloading boot (SmartBoot) combined with a smartwatch app and cloud dashboard to remotely monitor patient adherence and activity. In addition, the impact of SmartBoot on balance, gait, and user experience was investigated. Methods: Fourteen volunteers (31.6±8.7 years; 64% female) performed natural activities (eg, sitting, standing, walking) with and without the SmartBoot for approximately 30 minutes. All participants completed balance tests, 10-meter walking tests at slow, normal, and fast pace while wearing the SmartBoot, and a user experience questionnaire. The accuracy of real-time adherence reporting was assessed by comparing the SmartBoot and staff observation. Center of mass (COM) sway and step counts were measured using a validated wearable system. Results: Average sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for adherence and non-adherence were 90.6%, 88.0%, and 89.3%, respectively. The COM sway area was significantly smaller with the SmartBoot than without the SmartBoot regardless of test condition. Step count error was 4.4% for slow waking, 36.2% for normal walking, 16.0% for fast walking. Most participants agreed that the SmartBoot is easy to use, relatively comfortable, nonintrusive, and innovative. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first smart offloading system that enables remote patient monitoring and real-time adherence and activity reporting. The SmartBoot enhanced balance performance, likely due to somatosensory feedback. Questionnaire results highlight SmartBoot’s technical and clinical potential. Future studies warrant clinical validation of real-time non-adherence alerting to improve wound healing outcomes in people with diabetic foot ulcers."

The use of digital health technology systems (DHTSs) to collect mobility and medication data provides an opportunity to objectively quantify the effect of medication on motor performance during day-to-day activities. This insight could inform clinical decision-making, personalise care, and aid self-management. This study investigates the feasibility and usability of a multi-component DHTS to remotely assess self-reported medication adherence and monitor mobility in people with Parkinson's (PwP). Methods: Thirty participants with PD [Hoehn and Yahr stage I (n = 1) and II (n = 29)] were recruited for this cross-sectional study. Participants were required to wear, and where appropriate, interact with a DHTS (smartwatch, inertial measurement unit, and smartphone) for seven consecutive days to assess medication adherence and monitor digital mobility outcomes and contextual factors. Participants reported their daily motor complications [motor fluctuations and dyskinesias (i.e., involuntary movements)] in a diary. Following the monitoring period, participants completed a questionnaire to gauge the usability of the DHTS. Feasibility was assessed through the percentage of data collected, and usability through analysis of qualitative questionnaire feedback. Results: Adherence to each device exceeded 70% and ranged from 73 to 97%. Overall, the DHTS was well tolerated with 17/30 participants giving a score > 75% [average score for these participants = 89%, from 0 (worst) to 100 (best)] for its usability.

Aim: Here, we study the barriers and facilitators, as experienced by patients, caregivers and/or healthcare providers, to successful implement technology for PD management. Methods: We performed a systematic literature search in the PubMed and Embase databases until June 2022. Two independent raters screened the titles, abstracts and full texts on: 1) people with PD; 2) using technology for disease management; 3) qualitative research methods providing patients’, caregivers and/or healthcare providers’ perspective, and; 4) full text available in English or Dutch.

With the advancement in technology, physical activity monitors have become the go-to tools for objective and continuous monitoring of everyday physical activity in the community. While these devices are widely used in many patient populations, their use in individuals with acquired brain injury is slowly gaining traction. The first step before using activity monitors in this population is to understand the patient perspective on usability and ease of use of physical activity monitors at different wear locations.

Objectives: We designed a remote monitoring system for this purpose and describe the experiences of PwPD and physiotherapists who used the system in daily clinical practice. Methods: Twenty-one PwPD (15 men) wore a sensor necklace to passively record physical activity and falls for 6 weeks. They also used a smartphone app to self-report daily activities, (near-)falls and medication intake. They discussed those data with their PD-specialized physiotherapist (n = 9) during three regular treatment sessions. User experiences and aspects to be improved were gathered through interviews with PwPD and physiotherapists, resulting in system updates. The system was evaluated in a second pilot with 25 new PwPD (17 men) and eight physiotherapists. Results: We applied thematic analysis to the interview data resulting in two main themes: usability and utility. First, the usability of the system was rated positively, with the necklace being easy to use. However, some PwPD with limited digital literacy or cognitive impairments found the app unclear. Second, the perceived utility of the system varied among PwPD. While many PwPD were motivated to increase their activity level, others were not additionally motivated because they perceived their activity level as high. Physiotherapists appreciated the objective recording of physical activity at home and used the monitoring of falls to enlarge awareness of the importance of falls for PwPD. Based on the interview data of all participants, we drafted three user profiles for PwPD regarding the benefits of remote monitoring for physiotherapy: for profile 1, a monitoring system could act as a flagging dashboard to signal the need for renewed treatment; for profile 2, a monitoring system could be a motivational tool to maintain physical activity; for profile 3, a monitoring system could passively track physical activity and falls at home. Finally, for a subgroup of PwPD the burdens of monitoring will outweigh the benefits. Conclusions: Overall, both PwPD and physiotherapists underline the potential of a remote monitoring system to support physiotherapy by targeting physical activity and (near-)falls. Our findings emphasize the importance of personalization in remote monitoring technology, as illustrated by our user profiles."

Objective: The Virtual Ward Incorporating Electronic Wearables (VIEWER) trial implemented a home telemonitoring system to track changes in patients’ vitals and assess their adherence and the acceptability of telemonitoring in a chronic kidney disease (CKD) population. Design: A pilot prospective clinical trial using a mixed methods approach was performed. Setting: The research was conducted in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Participants: There were 2 phases: Phase 1 was a 2-week-long pilot trial consisting of 10 participants. Phase 2 was a 3-month-long trial with a total of 26 participants. Patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate <15 and a >40% risk of beginning dialysis in the next 2 years according to the kidney failure risk equation were eligible to participate in the study. Methods: The primary quantitative outcome was adherence, defined as the proportion of daily self-assessments completed using VIEWER over the follow-up period. The usability and acceptability of VIEWER was assessed qualitatively at the end of the trial through structured questionnaires and focus groups. Results: Phase 1 participants (n = 10) had a median adherence of 77.17% for the 2-week observation period. Phase 2 participants (n = 26) showed a lower median adherence of 36% for the 3-month period. Focus group participants (n = 11) identified many positive aspects of VIEWER, including increased awareness and empowerment over health, simplicity of the data platform, and the ability to show clinical staff their health trends. Some challenges identified with VIEWER were connectivity issues with the Bluetooth, perceived inconvenience, and negative thoughts toward their health Limitations: Limitations of the study include a small sample size, which limited our ability to measure quantitative outcomes. In addition, patients agreeing to participate in any trial are generally more highly motivated and engaged in their care than those declining participation. Therefore, our results may not be generalizable to individuals who are not interested in self-management of their health. Conclusion: Our results suggest that home telemonitoring in patients with advanced CKD is feasible using a CKD-specific platform like VIEWER. We anticipate that improved functionality with incorporation of feedback from this study will result in greater long-term adherence. A future randomized clinical trial is planned."

As part of the intervention, a pulse oximeter wearable device was delivered to patients to monitor their oxygen saturation levels, a critical indicator of COVID-19 patient deterioration. Understanding users’ perceptions toward the device is fundamental to assessing its usability and acceptability and contributing to the effectiveness of the intervention, but no research to date has explored the user experience of the pulse oximeter for remote monitoring in this setting. Objective: This study aimed to explore the use, performance, and acceptability of the pulse oximeter by clinicians and patients in rpavirtual during COVID-19. Methods: Semistructured interviews and usability testing were conducted. Stable adult patients with COVID-19 (aged ≥18 years) who used the pulse oximeter and were monitored by rpavirtual, and rpavirtual clinicians monitoring these patients were interviewed. Clinicians could be nurses, doctors, or staff who were part of the team that assisted patients with the use of the pulse oximeter. Usability testing was conducted with patients who had the pulse oximeter when they were contacted. Interviews were coded using the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability. Usability testing was conducted using a think-aloud protocol. Data were collected until saturation was reached. Results: Twenty-one patients (average age 51, SD 13 years) and 15 clinicians (average age 41, SD 11 years) completed the interview. Eight patients (average age 51, SD 13 years) completed the usability testing. All participants liked the device and thought it was easy to use. They also had a good understanding of how to use the device and the device’s purpose. Patients’ age and device use–related characteristics (eg, the warmth of hands and hand steadiness) were identified by users as factors negatively impacting the accurate use of the pulse oximeter. Conclusions: Patients and clinicians had very positive perceptions of the pulse oximeter for COVID-19 remote monitoring, indicating high acceptability and usability of the device. However, factors that may impact the accuracy of the device should be considered when delivering interventions using the pulse oximeter for remote monitoring. Targeted instructions about the use of the device may be necessary for specific populations (eg, older people and patients unfamiliar with technology). Further research should focus on the integration of the pulse oximeter data into electronic medical records for real-time and secure patient monitoring."

To combat this issue, the Pi-CON methodology is applied to develop a novel sensor with the objective to continuously acquire a patient’s vital signs from a distance, without the need to attach any markers or sensors to the patient, and with limited user interaction required. Pi-CON stands for passive, continuous and non-contact, and describes a way to improve the user experience for patients or caregivers that have a need to perform a vital signs measurement themselves, without the presence of a medical professional. The developed sensor utilises radar and optical sensing technologies and transmits acquired data to a cloud-based service where it can be viewed in near real-time by the patient or family members from anywhere via an intuitive user interface. This user interface, as well as the sensor itself were designed based on design needs and requirements to adhere to the user-centered design process.

Technology, such as wearable sensors and remote monitoring through tablets and smartphones, has the potential to overcome these barriers, but older adults may face challenges with adoption. Participatory design involves co-designing technology with end-users, is a promising strategy to enhance technology use among older adults. We present the usability results of GeRI, a technology-based platform for monitoring cancer treatment toxicity and aging metrics in the homes of older adults with cancer, which uses a simplified interface to collect activity, nutrition and symptom metrics. Objective(s) To summarize usability scores and feedback of a customized platform, GeRI, connecting a tablet, wrist accelerometer, and scale that can be used to remotely collect frailty, activity, and nutrition markers from older adult cancer survivors and caregivers. Methods In this participatory design study, n=7 older cancer survivors (OCS) and n=3 caregivers (CG) were recruited through the University of Chicago Cancer Center and Office of Community Engagement and Cancer Health Equity. They were given a GeRI prototype (Figure 1) to try at home for at least 2 weeks with access to technical support and a user manual. Semi-structured interviews were then conducted over videoconferencing. Participants were given a 10-item System Usability Scale (SUS) and a modified satisfaction and feature likeability survey (e.g., five-point Likert scales on their overall satisfaction with the platform as well as the touchscreen, user interface, font/notification size, wrist accelerometer). Based on their response, we probed further to identify ways to improve their experience with GeRI. (Figure Presented) Results The study's results on GeRI showed positive feedback from the predominantly minority older cancer survivors (mean age 74.9 [SD 6.6], Male, n=5 Black, n=6 Prostate Cancer) and caregivers (mean age 55, Female, n=2 Black) who consented and interviewed. The mean SUS score (0-100) was 92.8 (SD 8.7, range 72.5 - 100), and the mean overall satisfaction score (1-5) with the GeRI platform was 4.9 (SD 0.3) for all participants involved. Figure 2 depicts individual SUS item responses stratified by user type (OCS or CG). OCS mean SUS scores were 91.5 (SD 9.5), while the CG mean SUS was 95.8 (SD 7.2). 100% of participants rated the touchscreen, user interface, and wrist accelerometer as 'Excellent' or 'Very Good'. 100% and 90% agreed that the size of notifications and font were sufficient, respectively, while only 70% believed that alerts and notifications were adequate enough to remind them to engage with the tablet. Condensed quick start guides or instructional pictures/videos on the tablet (n= 8), sound or voice notifications (n=7), improved task labeling (n=7), and symptom selection organization (n=7) were reported as features to enhance usability. The 2 highest-ranked enhancements by participants were 'Messages from my Doctor' (n=4) and 'My Smartwatch/Smart Scale Data' (n=4). Conclusion The GeRI platform is the first open-source data collection platform targeting older adults with cancer and demonstrated high usability, with a mean SUS score of 92.8. However, more work is needed to optimize the user experience in a more diverse sample. The results of this study provide early design guidance for developers, including the most requested features, such as biometric data and provider communication, and recommendations for improved user materials, task notifications, and labeling/organization. Further participatory design studies with diverse older cancer cohorts are needed and planned to improve the user experience and maximize the adoption of the GeRI platform."

Currently, symptom severity is assessed by clinical assessments. Such assessments are limited in their ability to continuously capture changes and to capture the full impact of the disease. Remotely capturing data related to daily activities could provide additional insights in the disease. This study investigated the feasibility of using smartphones and wearables to capture symptoms. 38 FSHD patients and 20 non-FSHD control subjects were monitored using a smartphone for 6 weeks. At the first and last day of the study period, clinicians assessed the subjects' FSHD Clinical Score and Timed Up and Go time. Subjects installed the monitoring app on their smartphones, were given a smartwatch, and were instructed to record their weight and blood pressure (BP) weekly. The user experience was assessed at week 6 using a questionnaire. We built a model based on the remote data to distinguish between FSHD and control subjects. Overall, the app was well tolerated, but 67% of the subjects noticed reduced battery life. We classified FSHD and non- FSHD controls with 93% accuracy, 100% sensitivity, and 80% specificity. Features relating to smartphone acceleration, app usage, location, physical activity, sleep, and call behaviour were the most salient features for the classification. Remote monitoring data collection allows for the collection of daily activity data in FSHD patients and control subjects for 6 weeks. Furthermore, we demonstrated the ability to detect differences in features in FSHD patients and non- FSHD controls using smartphones and wearables."

In this study, we developed a new method based on volumetric absorptive microsampling (VAMS) combined with Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography–Tandem Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) to simultaneously quantify three analytes including TAC, MPA, and Cre in whole blood. (2) Methods: The VAMS-based UPLC-MS/MS assay used a shared extraction and a single injection to simultaneously quantify the included TAC, MPA, and Cre. Development and validation were carried out following the Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency guidelines for the validation of bioanalytical methods. Moreover, clinical validation for the three analytes was performed in both dried blood spot (DBS) and VAMS. Furthermore, a willingness survey was conducted using the system usability scale (SUS) for renal transplant recipients. (3) Results: The assay was successfully validated for all analytes. No interference, carryover, or matrix effects were observed, and extraction recoveries and process efficiencies were >90.00%. Analysis was unaffected by hematocrit (0.20~0.60, L/L) and anticoagulants (EDTA-2K). Dried VAMS samples were stable for 7 days at ambient temperature and stable for at least 1 month at −20 °C. During clinical validation, the measured TAC, corrected MPA, and Cre concentrations of VAMS samples met the analytical standards (95.00%, 88.57%, and 92.50%). When more stringent clinical acceptance criteria were set, the results obtained by VAMS (90.00%, 71.43%, and 85.00%) better than DBS (77.50%, 62.86%, and 70.00%). Compared with DBS, the survey found that renal transplant recipients are more inclined to use VAMS. (4) Conclusions: A robust extraction and UPLC-MS/MS analysis method in VAMS tips was developed and fully validated for the simultaneous quantification of TAC, MPA, and Cre concentrations. This method provides analytical support for the one-sample remote monitoring of both immunosuppressive drug concentrations and renal function in allo-renal recipients. Based on the good consistency between this method and the routine detection of venous blood samples and higher patient satisfaction than DBS, we believe that VAMS sampling can be a better alternative to venous whole-blood sampling."

For that reason, concentrating on this food is a good alternative for increasing its versatility and usability in different dairy industry segments. Block freeze concentration (BFC) is a simple technology used to concentrate liquid foods through ice crystal formation and subsequent removal of water. Thus, this work aimed to test two variants of the BFC technique on lactose-free milk concentration. In the first approach, it was investigated the centrifugation-assisted BFC of skim lactose-free milk by applying a factorial experimental design. Temperature, time, and rotation speed were the factors, and the response variables included the concentrate yield, concentration index, and efficiency of the process. Concentrate yield and concentration index were mainly affected by the centrifugation temperature. On the other hand, individual factors did not have a significant effect on the efficiency, only their interactions. In the case of centrifugation-assisted BFC in a single step, the condition at 40°C, 70 min, and 4500 rpm was considered the best, given the highest values of efficiency and concentrate yield (80.87 and 67.02, respectively), and still an excellent value for concentration index (2.05). Conversely, the condition at 30°C, 45 min, and 3500 rpm was chosen to integrate a freeze concentration process in two stage. Then, the ice obtained from the first cycle was subjected to the vacuum-assisted BFC, which consisted in the second cycle. The concentrate obtained from the vacuum-assisted BFC presented contents of total solids, carbohydrates, and protein 2.95, 3.00, and 2.91 times more than the initial lactose-free milk, respectively. Therefore, we believe that the concentrates obtained can be used for the development of innovative lactose-free dairy products. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Using concentration processes in the dairy industry can significantly contribute to enhancing the overall efficiency of milk processing since huge quantities of water from milk can be reduced, increasing the total solids content. In turn, dairy products that provide a high amount of solids (especially protein) are gaining in popularity among consumers, with consequent interest from researchers. In addition, milk concentration shows advantages in terms of processing, packaging, transportation, and handling. Since most changes occur in an aqueous environment, the removal of some parts of water results in the preservation of milk. It is noteworthy that dairy industries are concerned principally with food preservation, green technologies, and the production of high-quality products. Thus, concentration processes could favor the development of milk products rich in proteins to meet certain demands on functional and nutritional properties, for example in beverages and formulated food."

The need for a telemedicine approach to the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is widely acknowledged. Neuropsychological testing is a crucial component of the assessment of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and represents a gateway to biomarker assessment for prodromal AD diagnosis. The aim of TENÈPSIA project is the development of a high quality, tablet-based remote neuropsychological assessment platform. Methods: The Italian Neurological Society (SIN), the Italian Neuropsychological Society (SINP) and the Italian Neurological Society for Dementia (SINDEM) promoted the organization of a Working Group (WG) of experts in the clinical and neuropsychological assessments of dementia. The WG is in charge for the selection of scales and tests, their digital validation and implementation. The project is a partnership between Biogen Italy and SIN; in particular, Biogen provides digital, scientific and communication support, funding the development of digital platform through REPLY, which is the software developer of platform, and INSIDE AI that manages the in-silico test required for the certification as medical device. Results: TheWG selected a battery of rating scales and neuropsychological tests widely used in Italian clinical practice and suitable for a digitalization approach. These include questionnaires for the assessment of depression and functional status and tests of long-term memory, language, visuo-spatial abilities, executive functions, and social cognition. Software development took particular care in the usability of the platform and to the possibility of remote control of subject performance by the examiner. Discussion: The TENÈPSIA platform will enter the phase of beta testing in June 2022; in silico testing is proceeding in parallel with software development. In October 2022 it will be issued to the Notified Body to get the certification as Medical Device II A by December 2022. The subsequent phases will be dedicated to the collection of normative data in healthy subjects and validation on MCI and early AD clinical samples. Conclusions: Tele-neuropsychology is an area of research in constant progress, which has received an accelerated demand for tools and services to support clinical practice during the pandemic. A scientifically validated, digitalized platform, allowing a high level of automation in the procedures of stimuli administration, response collection, score correction and interpretation will favor the possibility of remote assessment with benefits for patients, families, and treatment centers."

We have previously reported on the impact of using a monitoring system with an infrared camera and communication robots (Obayashi et al. 2020). Further improvements were made to the detection accuracy of the camera, and functionalities for verbal interaction were added. This paper reports on these efforts in nursing homes, and their impact on the ground. Methods: The study was conducted with 34 older people and 20 care professionals in nursing homes. An infrared sensor and a biosensor were installed on the ceiling of each resident's room. When the camera detects movement by the resident, it notifies the care staff via the mobile terminal. Its detection accuracy was improved against sunlight and physical obstacles. A variety of qualitative and quantitative data (e.g. sleeping patterns and social participation of older people, system usability and staff task analysis) were collected before and after installation. Communication functions were added to the system. Results: False detection rates of the monitoring camera decreased significantly. Using the improved system for the duration of 34 days, 602 alerts were recorded in total and 430 staff visits to rooms during night shifts were spared. The task analysis revealed that time available for direct caregiving increased (e.g. direct communication: From 2 to 55 min), while indirect care activities decreased. After the introduction of communicative functions, system usability decreased, primarily due to inaudibility. However, the qualitative data support the idea of an interactive system. Key conclusions: Faced with the challenge of meeting increasing demand for person-centered care under limited resources, there will be a greater need for better integration of improved AT. The study indicates AT's potential for enhancing the quality of care for all."

To acquire wearing comfort and high-quality signals, patches with tissue-like softness, elastic recovery, damage tolerance, and robust bioelectronic interface are highly desired yet challenging to achieve. Here, we report a dry epidermal patch made from a supramolecular polymer (SESA) and an in situ transferred carbon nanotubes' percolation network. The polymer possesses a hybrid structure of copolymerized permanent scaffold permeated by multiple dynamic interactions, which imparts a desired mechanical response transition from elastic recoil to energy dissipation with increased elongation. Such SESA-based patches are soft (Young's modulus ∼0.1 MPa) and elastic within physiologically relevant strain levels (97% elastic recovery at 50% tensile strain), intrinsically mechanical-electrical damage-resilient (∼90% restoration from damage after 5 min), and interference-immune in dynamic signal acquisition (stretch, underwater, sweat). We demonstrate its versatile physiological sensing applications, including electrocardiogram recording under various disturbances, machine-learning-enabled hand-gesture recognition through electromyogram measurement, subtle radial artery pulse, and drastic knee kinematics sensing. This epidermal patch offers a promising noninvasive, long-duration, and ambulant bioelectronic interfacing with anti-interference robustness."

Wearable sensors make continuous long-term remote monitoring of performance dynamics in relevant ecological settings available to many people with chronic disease, including multiple sclerosis (MS). In conjunction with telemedicine and online apps, wearable technology promises a major expansion of the scope for people with MS (PwMS) by allowing more confident descriptions of prognoses, the relative long-term benefits, more safe disease-modifying treatments (DMT) and improved self-management. Moreover, together with registries and electronic health records, more detailed MS-specific data could be easier shared between clinicians, provide data needed to improve the DMT impact, and characterize clinically relevant interactions between MS and other diseases. Wearable technology has been adopted in MS to measure all the most relevant clinical domains. The nature of MS evolution would have firstly required the use of wearable sensors able to assess the presence of physical changes due to the disease (i.e. gait, posture and upper limb disorders). Activity monitors, accelerometers and gyroscopes are the oldest sensors introduced in the MS clinical context because those were the most readily available technology. Nowadays, variables such as event detection, spatiotemporal indexes, estimation of joint kinematics, and postural balance parameters obtained from these sensors are widely used in the assessment, rehabilitation, assistance and disease prediction of PwMS. More recently, the clinical monitoring in MS took advantage of the development and validation of smartphone apps. Apps implementing standard tests (e.g. the Symbol Digit Modalities Test) and gamification have mainly supported the remote cognitive evaluation whereas visual analogue scales and patient reported outcomes have been mostly used to long-term monitor fatigue, mood symptoms (e.g. anxiety), pain and QoL. Despite the advancements continuously evolve and research findings are increasingly reliable, wearable devices usability is poorly measured and more attention should be paid to this aspect in order to propose future tools tailored on the needs of PwMS. Healthcare research is in the midst of a paradigm shift and wearable technology plays a crucial role allowing an ecological monitoring of human behaviour."

By taking advantage of both the composition of multiple functional materials and the design of a microstructured device configuration, the developed fiber-shaped sensor exhibits an ultrahigh sensitivity (maximum gauge factor of 7336.1), an extremely large workable strain range (500%), a low strain detection limit (0.5%), a fast response time (200 ms) and good stability (10 000 cycles). In addition, the sensor is temperature insensitive, inert under harsh solution conditions, degradable and recyclable.

Background: The standard practice for evaluating PD symptoms is highly subjective and inaccurate and can be considered flawed [1], [2]. The route to objective evaluation of PD symptoms lies in the use of continuous telemonitoring systems (i.e., recording for some days per month), which could also help personalize and provide remote access to quality healthcare services. The application of telemonitoring to PD has been studied extensively as a new paradigm for managing the disease in general [3]-[7] and also during the COVID-19 pandemic [8]-[10], which made a lot of patients avoid visits to physicians and healthcare units. Methods: The user satisfaction and clinical benefits of the telemonitoring system [11] was evaluated in a multicenter, single arm, clinical trial. The study includes a baseline and two follow-up patient visits (month 3 and 6). At each visit, a number of different scales and questionnaires are filled by patients and physicians. A specially-designed questionnaire is used to evaluate the physician satisfaction and the usability of the system for each patient visit. Results: From 14 completed physician questionnaires we extracted the following statistics: 85.7% of physicians said that the use of the system helped to better evaluate patients' symptoms. 78.6% of responders indicated that the system helped to faster assess patients' symptoms. 78.6% of physicians said that the use of the system helped them make decisions about therapeutic interventions in patients. More specifically, based on physicians' input, there were 16 medication changes based on system-provided information. 92.9% of replies indicate that the use of the system helps to accurately record patient's symptoms in their environment, without limiting their daily activities. 85.7% of physicians believe that the use of the system helps them to better assess the general situation of patients in their own environment, without being a burden to their clinical work. Conclusions: The results demonstrate that the vast majority of physicians agree a telemonitoring wearable system could help them better and faster assess the symptoms of patients in their own environment, without additional burden for physicians, while providing meaningful information in the decision-making process for therapeutic interventions."

However, challenges such as wearable comfort, multiple applicable conditions, and differentiation of mechanical stimuli are yet to be fully addressed. Herein, we developed a breathable and waterproof electronic skin (E-skin) that can perceive pressure/strain with nonoverlapping signals. The synergistic effect from magnetic attraction and nanoscaled aggregation renders the E-skin with microscaled pores for breathability and three-dimensional microcilia for superhydrophobicity. Upon applied pressure, the bending of conductive microcilia enables sufficient contacts for resistance decrease, while the stretching causes increased resistance due to the separation of conductive materials. The optimized E-skin exhibits a high gauge factor of 7.747 for small strain (0-80%) and a detection limit down to 0.04%. The three-dimensional microcilia also exhibit a sensitivity of -0.0198 kPa-1 (0-3 kPa) and a broad detection range up to 200 kPa with robustness. The E-skin can reliably and precisely distinguish kinds of the human joint motions, covering a broad spectrum including bending, stretching, and pressure. With the nonoverlapping readouts, ternary inputs ""1"", ""0"", and ""-1"" could be produced with different stimuli, which expands the command capacity for logic outputs such as effective Morse code and intuitive robotic control. Owing to the rapid response, long-term stability (10 000 cycles), breathability, and superhydrophobicity, we believe that the E-skin can be widely applied as wearable devices from body motion monitoring to human-machine interactions toward a more convenient and intelligent future."

Current methods rely on blood draws, which limit them to clinical settings and do not allow frequent or portable monitoring. In this study, we demonstrated the usability of PointCheck, a noninvasive device for neutropenia screening, in a simulated home environment without clinical supervision. PointCheck automatically performs microscopy through the skin of the finger to image the blood flowing through superficial microcapillaries and enables the remote monitoring of neutropenia status, without requiring venipuncture. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the usability of PointCheck, a noninvasive optical technology for screening severe neutropenia, with the goal of identifying potential user interface, functionality, and design issues from the perspective of untrained users. Methods: We conducted a multicenter study using quantitative and qualitative approaches to evaluate the usability of PointCheck across 154 untrained participants. We used a mixed method approach to gather usability data through user testing observations, a short-answer qualitative questionnaire, and a standardized quantitative System Usability Scale (SUS) survey to assess perceived usability and satisfaction. Results: Of the 154 participants, we found that 108 (70.1%) scored above 80.8 on the SUS across all sites, with a mean SUS score of 86.1 across all sites. Furthermore, the SUS results indicated that, out of the 151 users who completed the SUS survey, 145 (96%) found that they learned how to use PointCheck very quickly, and 141 (93.4%) felt very confident when using the device. Conclusions: We have shown that PointCheck, a novel technology for noninvasive, home-based neutropenia detection, can be safely and effectively operated by first-time users. In a simulated home environment, these users found it easy to use, with a mean SUS score of 86.1, indicating an excellent perception of usability and placing this device within the top tenth percentile of systems evaluated for usability by the SUS."

Furthermore, information regarding the patient clinical record is also shown upon request. Finally, the XR-based monitoring platform also allows displaying in XR the video stream coming directly from the endoscope. The innovative aspect of the proposed XR-based monitoring platform lies in the comprehensiveness of the available information, in its modularity and flexibility (in terms of adaption to different sources of data), ease of use, and most importantly, in a reliable communication, which are critical requirements for the healthcare field. To validate the proposed system, experimental tests were conducted using instrumentation typically available in the operating room (i.e., a respiratory ventilator, a patient monitor for intensive care, and an endoscope). The overall results showed (i) an accuracy of the data communication greater than 99 %, along with (ii) an average time response below ms, and (iii) satisfying feedback from the SUS questionnaires filled out by the physicians after intensive use."

However, for reasons that are not fully understood, in some people this protective mechanism accidentally attacks the organs and tissues, thus causing inflammation and leads to the development of autoimmune diseases. Remote monitoring of human health involves the use of sensor network technology as a means of capturing patient data, and wearable devices, such as smartwatches, have lately been considered good collectors of biofeedback data, owing to their easy connectivity with a mHealth system. Moreover, the use of gamification may encourage the frequent usage of such devices and behavior changes to improve self-care for autoimmune diseases. This study reports on the use of wearable sensors for inflammation surveillance and autoimmune disease management based on a literature search and evaluation of an app prototype with fifteen stakeholders, in which eight participants were diagnosed with autoimmune or inflammatory diseases and four were healthcare professionals. Of these, six were experts in human-computer interaction to assess critical aspects of user experience. The developed prototype allows the monitoring of autoimmune diseases in pre-, during-, and post-inflammatory crises, meeting the personal needs of people with this health condition. The findings suggest that the proposed prototype-iShU-achieves its purpose and the overall experience may serve as a foundation for designing inflammation surveillance and autoimmune disease management monitoring solutions."

The rapid transition to telemedicine solutions did not allow a complete assessment of the user experience by both patients and medical personnel. Despite the well-known benefits in remote care, the lack of usability evaluation of already existing technologies for the vital signs measurement has emerged. A telemedicine platform must match video communication between patients and the medical staff with the possibility to measure vital parameters. Furthermore, technological assistance may overcome the unfamiliarity with telemedicine and drastically reduce the learning time for both patients and medical personnel. Objectives: The research work presents a method to improve the user experience of a telemedicine service based on the combination of televisits and telemonitoring with wearable sensors for heart failure patients. Skilled technological staff is proposed by the presented method to lead the learning process of both medical personnel and patients in order to reach a high level of usability in less than 6 months. Methods: The proposed method is composed of 5 steps: identification of technological staff and end users; selection of the telemedicine platform; design of questionnaires for usability analysis; training of clinicians and patients; final usability evaluation of the telemedicine platform by means of customized satisfaction questionnaires and Post-Study System Usability Questionnaires (PSSUQs). The methodological approach has been tested in collaboration with a heart failure clinic by involving 5 physicians, 5 nurses, 15 heart failure patients, a research engineer and 4 technicians. A platform with 3 wearable sensors has been chosen: a wireless thermometer, a finger pulse-oximeter and an undershirt have been used for the detection of ECG trace. While these devices allowed asynchronous measurements of physiological data, scheduled televisits have been used for direct communication between physicians and patients. Results: Satisfaction questionnaires of patients and clinicians reached respectively 65.18% and 65.83%, while PSSUQ scores were respectively 91.73% and 81.70%. Both groups of end users confirmed a good level of usability and their satisfaction about the ease of use and the perceived quality of the instrumentation. Moreover, 73% of patients did not require help from caregivers to use the kit of sensors. The results have been reached in 5.5 months according to the aim defined initially. Research engineers have played a crucial role in helping clinicians and patients to improve the user experience with the telemedicine platform. Conclusions: The high level of usability and satisfaction confirmed that the proposed methodological approach helps to learn the technological features of the telemedicine platforms, which are based on different types of technology, such as web applications, wearable sensors and virtual calls.

We report a dual-modal sensor made with two functionalized optical microfibers (MFs), which is inspired by the somatosensory system of human skin. The integrated sensor with a hierarchical structure gradationally detects finger approaching and touching by measuring the relative humidity (RH) and force-triggered light intensity variations. Specifically, the RH sensory part shows enhanced evanescent absorption, achieving a sensitive RH measurement with a fast response (110 ms), a high resolution (0.11%RH), and a wide working range (10-100%RH). Enabled by the transition from guided modes into radiation modes of the waveguiding MF, the force sensory part exhibits a high sensitivity (6.2%/kPa) and a fast response (up to 1.5 kHz). By using a real-time data processing unit, the proximity-contact sensor (PCS) achieves continuous detection of the full-contact events, including finger approaching, contacting, pressing, releasing, and leaving. As a proof of concept, the electromagnetic-interference-free PCS enables a smart switch system to recognize the proximity and contact of bare/gloved fingers.

Telemedicine and sensor-based assessments can allow physicians to better observe the evolvement of symptoms over time, in particular with motor fluctuations. In addition, they potentially allow less frequent visits to the expert’s office and facilitate care in rural areas. A variety of systems with different strengths and shortcomings has been investigated in recent years. We designed a multimodal telehealth intervention (TelePark) to mitigate the shortcomings of individual systems and assessed the feasibility of our approach in 12 patients with PD over 12 weeks in preparation for a larger randomized controlled trial. TelePark uses video visits, a smartphone app, a camera system, and wearable sensors. Structured training included setting up the equipment in patients’ homes and group-based online training. Usability was assessed by questionnaires and semi-standardized telephone interviews. Overall, 11 out of 12 patients completed the trial (5 female, 6 male).

Adherence was stable throughout the study and 79% for a short questionnaire administered every second day, 62% for medication confirmation, and 33% for an electronic Hauser diary. Quality of life did not change in the course of the study, and a larger cohort will be required to determine the effect on motor symptoms. Interviews with trial participants identified motivations to use such systems and areas for improvements. These insights can be helpful in designing similar trials."

The success of critical or emergency care is determined by the quality and accuracy of the information received during the emergency call and the data collected during emergency transportation. The Internet of Things (IoT) consists of many smart devices and components that communicate via their connection to the Internet, which is used to collect data with sensors that obtain personal health parameters. In the past, most health measurement systems were based on a single dedicated orientation, and few systems had multiple devices on the same platform. In addition to traditional health measurement technologies, most such systems use centralized data transmission, which means that health measurement data have become the exclusive intellectual asset of the system developer. Therefore, this study develops an IoT-based message-broker system that is deployed and demonstrated for five health devices: blood oxygen, blood pressure, forehead temperature, body temperature, and body weight sensors. A central controller accessed by radio-frequency identification (RFID) collects clients' health profiles on the cloud platform. All collected data can be quickly shared, analyzed, and visualized, and the health devices can be changed, added to, and removed reliably when the requirements change. Additionally, following the message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) protocol, all devices can communicate with each other and be integrated into a higher-level health measurement standard (such as blood pressure plus weight or body temperature plus blood oxygen). We implement a smart healthcare monitoring system (SHMS) and verify its reliability. We use MQTT to establish an open communication format that other organizations can follow to perform individual patient vital sign monitoring in potential applications. The robustness and flexibility of this research can be verified through the addition of other systems. Through this structure, more large-scale health detection devices can be integrated into the method proposed in this research in the future. Personal RFID or health insurance cards can be used for personal services or in medical institutions, and the data can easily be shared through the mechanism of this research. Such information sharing will enable the utilization of medical resources to be maximized."

Here, we report the initial feasibility and usability results for the ePRO app and biosensor. Methods: The study includes a vanguard phase (n = 32) to obtain early feedback on pt experience of the app and biosensor. After 2 weeks of continuous biosensor monitoring and daily ePRO reporting, 10 pts participated in semi-structured telephone interviews conducted by trained study staff. Open-ended questions addressed usability and technology-driven facilitators and barriers. Pts were also asked about ease of use and biosensor comfort on a 10-point Likert scale (higher scores reflected better usability and comfort). Transcripts were summarized using a FITTE-adapted framework and coded in ATLAS.ti 22.0.11.0. Coded data were summarized and consolidated into matrices to identify areas for improvement in future study phases. Results: Participants were approached until the target of 10 completed interviews was met. Respondents resembled the overall study population with regards to gender, race, ethnicity, age, and adherence to wearing the sensor and completing daily ePROs. For ease of use, the average rating among participants was 9 for the app (range 8.5-10) and 9.5 for the biosensor (range 7-10). Biosensor comfort was rated 7 on average (range 3-9). The most common words used to describe the app were easy, simple, and straightforward. Sixty percent of pts said that the watch needed to be charged too often and that their experience could be improved by offering more sensor functions and allowing pts to view and track their ePRO responses and biometric data. Sixty percent of pts also supported using these technologies to monitor symptoms during cancer therapy, stating that it was a good idea or useful, especially if it prevented hospitalization or increased communication with their care team. Conclusions: Overall, pts reported positive experiences wearing the sensor and using the ePRO app to report their symptoms during the 2-week observation period. Ease of use was high for both the app and biosensor. A majority reported dissatisfaction with the battery life of the biosensor. Most stated that they would prefer more opportunities to interact directly with the devices and to monitor their own symptoms by viewing collected ePRO and biometric data. Building this type of functionality into the app and sensor for future study phases could help pts engage more with the devices and potentially improve adherence."

While noninvasive methods of telemonitoring have thus far generally failed to predict and reduce the risk of admissions, invasive hemodynamic monitoring of pulmonary artery pressure has shown efficacy in this regard. However, data from the pulmonary artery fail to accurately estimate left-side filling pressures in substantial number of patients with HF. The aim of this study, therefore, was to describe the feasibility, safety, and accuracy of a novel wireless left atrial pressure (LAP) monitoring system in HF patients. Methods: The V-LAP Left Atrium Monitoring System for Patients With Chronic Systolic and Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure (VECTOR-HF) study is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm, open-label, first-in human clinical trial to assess the safety, performance, and usability of the V-LAP system (Vectorious Medical Technologies) in NYHA functional class III HF patients. The device was implanted in the interatrial septum via a percutaneous transseptal approach, guided by fluoroscopy and echocardiography. Primary end points included the successful deployment of the implant, ability to perform initial pressure measurements, and safety outcomes. Results: In this ongoing study, 24 patients have been implanted with the V-LAP system, yielding a 100% procedural success rate. No device-related complications have occurred. LAP was reported accurately, correlating with wedge pressure at 3 months (R = 0.86). After 6 months, NYHA functional class was better than at baseline (2.6 ± 0.6 vs 3.0 ± 0.0; P = 0.007), while 6-minute walk test distance had not changed significantly (313.9 ± 144.9 vs 232.5 ± 129.9 m; P = 0.076).

The industrial synthesis route of miglitol involves the biotransformation from N-2-hydroxyethyl glucamine to 6-(N-hydroxyethyl)-amino-6-deoxy-alpha-l-sorbofuranose and the subsequent hydrogenation from 6-(N-hydroxyethyl)-amino-6-deoxy-alpha-l-sorbofuranose to miglitol. This study comprehensively investigated the hydrogenation process and catalyst, and the effect of operating parameters on the product yield. RESULTS: A 55.6% miglitol yield was obtained under the following optimal reaction conditions: 5 g L−1 palladium/carbon (Pd/C) (5% Pd); ethanol addition 1:1 ethanol:water (v/v); 80 g L−16-(N-hydroxyethyl)-amino-6-deoxy-alpha-l-sorbofuranose; reaction temperature 25 °C; solution pH 6; stirring speed 500 rpm; hydrogen pressure 1 MPa. The yield obtained was much higher than the average 36.8% in current industrial production. Catalyst deactivation during reuse was found to be caused by biological impurities, especially the macromolecular impurities introduced in previous biotransformation. The deposition of impurities on the porous support of the Pd/C catalyst may be the direct cause of catalyst deactivation. CONCLUSION: Optimal conditions for the hydrogenation in the synthesis of miglitol were determined. It also was confirmed that biological impurities need to be completely removed to avoid catalyst deactivation and to improve catalyst reusability."

Patients were asked to answer a daily survey, to perform three weekly active tests, and to perform a monthly in-person clinical assessment. Feasibility and usability were explored as primary and secondary outcomes. An exploratory analysis was performed to investigate the correlation between data from the mKinetikos app and clinical assessments. Results: Seventeen participants (85%) completed the study. Sixteen participants (94.1%) showed a medium-to-high level of compliance with the mKinetikos system. A 6-point drop in the total score of the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire was observed. Conclusions: Our results support the feasibility of the mKinetikos system for continuous and objective real-life measures of a patient's health and functional mobility. The observed correlations of mKinetikos metrics with clinical data seem to suggest that this mHealth solution is a promising tool to support clinical decisions."

Herein, all-solution-processed on-skin electronics based on self-reconfigurable high-weight-per- volume-gelatin (HWVG) film constructed using an effective, biocompatible water absorption-evaporation technique are demonstrated. Completely conformal contact of self-reconfigurable HWVG films is realized by rapidly inducing anisotropic swelling in the perpendicular direction and covering any curvature on the skin without spatial gap or void after shrinking. A sufficiently thin HWVG film (~2 um) exhibited higher adhesion owing to van der Waals force and the carboxylic acid and amine groups in HWVG film form cross-linkages through intermolecular bonds with human skin. Self-reconfigurable HWVG films with high biocompatibility are optimized to afford a superior efficiency of 87.83 % at a concentration of 20 % (w/v) and a storage modulus of 1822 MPa at 36.5 °C. Furthermore, functional nanoelectrodes consisting of self-reconfigurable silver nanowires/HWVG films for high-performance on-skin sensors allowing the detection of sensitive motion and electrophysiological signals, as well as an armband-type sensor system incorporated with a smartphone for health-care monitoring are demonstrated. Outstanding performances, including stability, reliability, flexibility, re-usability, biocompatibility, and permeability of on-skin electronics based on HWVG films can open-up a prospective route to realizing breathable human-machine interfaces based on biocompatible materials and processes."

However, mainstream consumer-grade tracking devices and smartphone apps are often inaccurate and require long-term acceptability assessment. OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to assess the user acceptability of an instrumented shoe insole in frail older adults. This device monitors participants' walking speed and differentiates active walking from shuffling after step length calibration. METHODS: A multiphase evaluation has been designed: 9 older adults were evaluated in a living lab for a day, 3 older adults were evaluated at home for a month, and a prospective randomized trial included 35 older adults at home for 3 months. A qualitative research design using face-to-face and phone semistructured interviews was performed. Our hypothesis was that this shoe insole was acceptable in monitoring long-term outdoor and indoor walking. The primary outcome was participants' acceptability, measured by a qualitative questionnaire and average time of insole wearing per day. The secondary outcome described physical frailty evolution in both groups. RESULTS: Living lab results confirmed the importance of a multiphase design study with participant involvement. Participants proposed insole modifications. Overall acceptability had mixed results: low scores for reliability (2.1 out of 6) and high scores for usability (4.3 out of 6) outcomes. The calibration phase raised no particular concern. During the field test, a majority of participants (mean age 79 years) were very (10/16) or quite satisfied (3/16) with the insole's comfort at the end of the follow-up. Participant insole acceptability evolved as follows: 63% (12/19) at 1 month, 50% (9/18) at 2 months, and 75% (12/16) at 3 months. A total of 9 participants in the intervention group discontinued the intervention because of technical issues. All participants equipped for more than a week reported wearing the insole every day at 1 month, 83% (15/18) at 2 months, and 94% (15/16) at 3 months for 5.8, 6.3, and 5.1 hours per day, respectively. Insole data confirmed that participants effectively wore the insole without significant decline during follow-up for an average of 13.5 days per 4 months and 5.6 hours per day. For secondary end points, the change in frailty parameters or quality of life did not differ for those randomly assigned to the intervention group compared to usual care. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reports acceptability data on an instrumented insole in indoor and outdoor walking with remote monitoring in frail older adults under real-life conditions. To date, there is limited data in this population set. This thin instrumentation, including a flexible battery, was a technical challenge and seems to provide an acceptable solution over time that is valued by participants. However, users still raised certain acceptability issues. Given the growing interest in wearable health care devices, these results will be useful for future developments.

However, traditional plastic or elastomer substrates with impermeability, uncomfortableness, mechanical mismatches, and nondegradability greatly restricted their practical applications. Therefore, the fabrication of such pressure sensors with high flexibility, facile degradability, and breathability is still a critical challenge and highly desired. Herein, we present a wearable, breathable, degradable, and highly sensitive MXene/protein nanocomposites-based pressure sensor. The fabricated MXene/protein-based pressure sensor is assembled from a breathable conductive MXene coated silk fibroin nanofiber (MXene-SF) membrane and a silk fibroin nanofiber membrane patterned with a MXene ink-printed (MXene ink-SF) interdigitated electrode, which can serve as the sensing layer and the electrode layer, respectively. The assembled pressure sensor exhibits a wide sensing range (up to 39.3 kPa), high sensitivity (298.4 kPa-1 for 1.4-15.7 kPa; 171.9 kPa-1 for 15.7-39.3 kPa), fast response/recovery time (7/16 ms), reliable breathability, excellent cycling stability over 10 000 cycles, good biocompatibility, and robust degradability. Furthermore, it shows great sensing performance in monitoring human psychological signals, acting as an artificial skin for the quantitative illustration of pressure distribution, and wireless biomonitoring in real time. Considering the biodegradable and breathable features, the sensor may become promising to find potential applications in smart electronic skins, human motion detection, disease diagnosis, and human-machine interaction."

Adverse events of red cell transfusions, like transfusion reactions and iron overload are reasons for considering a restrictive transfusion strategy. However, there are no completed trials in the outpatient setting for chronic transfusion-dependent patients, and little data in general about the value of outpatient transfusions. With no objective parameters to measure the benefits of red cell transfusions, a restrictive transfusion strategy may not be optimal for patients who require RBCT on a regular basis. Transfusions are ordered primarily based on haemoglobin concentrations and a subjective interpretation of symptoms of anaemia. Endpoints that may be more clinically relevant include quality of life measurements, vital signs, functional activity and cognition. To date, there has been little systematic assessment of tools that assess these measures and no published trials that have examined the impact of transfusions on functional outcomes in transfusion-dependent patients. Aims: The aim of this study is to understand how wearable devices and web-based testing can be used to measure physiological changes and functional activity in a cohort of transfusion-dependent patients. Methods: We monitored 5 patients who chronically receive transfusions during one transfusion cycle with the VitalPatch. and Withings Steel HR. Patients completed CANTAB cognitive tasks, QUALMS and PROMIS quality of life questionnaires through web-based testing. Outcomes were first the quality and usability of data. Second, we leveraged mixed models to evaluate transfusion-induced changes in 1) heart rate, 2) activity, 3) sustained attention, and 4) patient-reported quality of life. Results: Captured data was 97,8% high quality and usable for the VitalPatch; 98,9% for the Withings Steel HR. The sent out web-based CANTAB tasks and questionnaires were all completed on the appointed days. Heart rate and sustained attention are significantly and reversibly affected by RBC transfusions, corrected for predefined confounders (Fig. 1): Mean daytime heart rate was 76.5±2.8 bpm before and 72.3±2.8 after transfusion (P=0.002). Sustained attention (RVPA) increased from 8586±140 to 9141±183 after transfusion (P=0.004). Activity and quality of life measures did not yield transfusion-induced changes. The measured activity data may not be representative as the study was conducted during the COVID-19 induced lockdown."

Wearable ECG measurement systems in the form of clothing have been proposed to replace Holter monitors used for clinical ECG monitoring; however, they have limitations in daily use because they compress the upper body and, in doing so, cause discomfort during wear. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to develop a wireless wearable ECG monitoring system that includes a textile ECG electrode that can be applied to the lining of pants and can be used in the same way that existing lower clothing is worn, without compression to the upper body. METHODS: A textile electrode with stretchable characteristics was fabricated by knitting a conductive yarn together with polyester-polyurethane fiber, which was then coated with silver compound; an ECG electrode was developed by placing it on an elastic band in a modified limb lead configuration. In addition, a system with analog-to-digital conversion, wireless communication, and a smartphone app was developed, allowing users to be able to check and store their own ECGs in real time. A signal processing algorithm was also developed to remove noise from the obtained signal and to calculate the heart rate. To evaluate the ECG and heart rate measurement performance of the developed module, a comparative evaluation with a commercial device was performed. ECGs were measured for 5 minutes each in standing, sitting, and lying positions; the mean absolute percentage errors of heart rates measured with both systems were then compared. RESULTS: The system was developed in the form of a belt buckle with a size of 53 × 45 × 12 mm (width × height × depth) and a weight of 23 g. In a qualitative evaluation, it was confirmed that the P-QRS-T waveform was clearly observed in ECGs obtained with the wearable system. From the results of the heart rate estimation, the developed system could track changes in heart rate as calculated by a commercial ECG measuring device; in addition, the mean absolute percentage errors of heart rates were 1.80%, 2.84%, and 2.48% in the standing, sitting, and lying positions, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The developed system was able to effectively measure ECG and calculate heart rate simply through being worn as existing clothing without upper body pressure. It is anticipated that general usability can be secured through further evaluation under more diverse conditions."

As mobile health (mHealth) technology gains universal leverage and popularity, it is becoming more user-friendly for older adults and an adjunct to manage CVD risk and improve overall cardiovascular health. With the rapid advances in mHealth technology and increasing technological engagement of older adults, a comprehensive understanding of the current literature and knowledge of gaps and barriers surrounding the impact of mHealth on secondary CVD prevention is essential. After a systematic review of the literature, 26 studies that used mHealth for secondary CVD prevention focusing on lifestyle behavior change and medication adherence in cohorts with a mean age of ≥60 years were identified. Improvements in health behaviors and medication adherence were observed, particularly when there was a short message service (ie, texting) component involved. Although mobile technologies are becoming more mainstream and are starting to blend more seamlessly with standard health care, there are still distinct barriers that limit implementation particularly in older adults, including affordability, usability, privacy, and security issues. Furthermore, studies on the type of mHealth that is the most effective for older adults with longer study duration are essential as the field continues to grow. As our population ages, identifying and implementing effective, widely accepted, cost-effective, and time-efficient mHealth interventions to improve CVD health in a vulnerable demographic group should be a top health priority."

We developed a smartphone application (app) for patients to tele-monitor gout flares surveyed by clinicians. The aim of this study was to assess patient acceptability and technical and clinical feasibility. Methods: Adult patients with either established gout or high suspicion thereof were recruited if they possessed a smartphone and reported a recent arthritis attack. A smartphone application was used to identify gout flares by asking during 90 consecutive days: (1) what is your pain score (0-10); (2) are your joints warm; (3) are your joints swollen; and (4) are you currently experiencing a gout flare? The clinician was alerted via email if a flare occurred. Patient acceptability was assessed using the technology acceptance model. Technical feasibility consisted of reported technical issues and clinical feasibility of actions taken by the clinician regarding gout flare alerts. Results: Twenty-nine included patients completed the study. The mean age of participants was 57 years, and all but one were male. The adherence rate was 96% (110 of 2910 queries were missed). Patients had a positive attitude toward app use, found the app very easy to use (mean usability score 81 out of 100) and were neutral to positive on its usefulness. There were four minor technical issues. A total of 100 gout flare alerts were generated that led to 18 proactive contacts with patients. Conclusion: A smartphone app to monitor gout flares was developed and tested, showing high adherence, good acceptability and clinical feasibility for established gout patients.

However, there is limited research examining diverse information needs of different groups of health care workers and their access to appropriate information technologies. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the issues associated with using technologies that connect older people to their health care providers to support aging in place and enhance older people's health and well-being. METHODS: Seven focus group discussions were conducted comprising 44 health care professionals who provided clinic-based or in-home services to community-dwelling older people. Participants were asked about their information needs and how technology could help them support older people to age in place. The recordings of the sessions were transcribed and thematically analyzed. RESULTS: The perspectives varied between the respondents who worked in primary care clinics and those who worked in community-based services. Three overarching themes were identified. The first theme was ""access to technology and systems,"" which examined the different levels of technology in use and the problems that various groups of health care professionals had in accessing information about their patients. Primary care professionals had access to good internal information systems but they experienced poor integration with other health care providers. The community-based teams had poor access to technology. The second theme was ""collecting and sharing of information,"" which focused on how technology might be used to provide them with more information about their patients. Primary care teams were interested in telemonitoring for specific clinical indicators but they wanted the information to be preprocessed. Community-based teams were more concerned about gaining information on the patients' social environment. The third theme was that all respondents identified similar ""barriers to uptake"": cost and funding issues, usability of systems by older people, and information security and privacy concerns. CONCLUSIONS: The participants perceived the potential benefits of technologies, but they were concerned that the information they received should be preprocessed and integrated with current information systems and tailored to the older people's unique and changing situations. Several management and governance issues were identified, which needed to be resolved to enable the widespread integration of these technologies into the health care system. The disconnected nature of the current information architecture means that there is no clear way for sensor data from telemonitoring and smart home devices to be integrated with other patient information. Furthermore, cost, privacy, security, and usability barriers also need to be resolved. This study highlights the importance and the complexity of management and governance of systems to collect and disseminate such information. Further research into the requirements of all stakeholder groups and how the information can be processed and disseminated is required."

Motivation to use wearables is not only driven by the accuracy and reliability of the performance but also by the form factor, comfort, and stability on the body. We collected direct feedback and device placement-related issues experienced by a cohort of people with epilepsy (PWE) to investigate to what extent available devices are nonintrusive, comfortable, and stable on the body. Methods: Four models of wearable devices (E4 wrist band, Everion upper arm band, IMEC upper arm band, and Epilog scalp patch electrodes) were worn by PWE who were admitted to two epilepsy monitoring units (EMUs) in London and Freiburg. Participants were periodically reviewed, and accidental displacements of the devices were annotated. Participants' experience was assessed using the Technology Acceptance Model Fast Form (TAM-FF) plus two additional questions on comfort. A thematic analysis was also performed on the free text of the questionnaire. Results: One hundred and fifteen participants were enrolled. The devices had a good stability on the body including during seizures. Overall, all the devices were considered comfortable to be worn, including during sleep. However, devices containing wires and patches demonstrated a lesser degree of stability on the body and were judged less positively. Participants age was correlated with TAM-FF mean scores, and older participants judged the devices less favorably compared with younger participants. Discussion: Removable but securely fitted, wireless, and comfortable designs were considered more appropriate for a continuous monitoring aimed at seizure detection. Some caution may be required when patch electrodes and electrodes glued to the skin or to the scalp are used, as those evaluated in the present study demonstrated a lower level of acceptability and a lower degree of stability to the body, especially at night. These factors could limit a continuous monitoring decreasing the device performance for nocturnal, unsupervised seizures which are at higher risk of lethality."

Continuous collection and optimal data quality are paramount to guarantee the acquisition of clinically meaningful data. It is still unknown how successfully patients can self-manage new technologies and which factors have an impact on this. We assessed the performance of patients managing a wrist-worn device. Method: patients wearing a wrist-worn device received a single training session to perform 5 tasks: (1) fitting the device correctly; (2) switching the device on and off; (3) charging the device on a daily basis; (4) pairing the device with a phone or tablet; (5) seeking assistance. Participants were then reviewed every 24 h and, at the end of the study, a Wearable technology Self-management Score (WSS) was calculated according to their performance in the different tasks (0–12). The association between WSS, seizure capture, demographics and clinical characteristics was analysed. Results: Thirty patients were included. The mean WSS score was 9.4 ± 2.1 points. The task more often performed inaccurately was pairing the device with a phone or tablet, followed by performing charging procedures. A strong association was found between WSS and seizure capture (p = 0.019), with higher scores strongly associated with more seizures captured. A WSS of ≥9 was the minimum value of WSS that allowed the device to record all the seizures. Number of AEDs and illness-perception related factors (perceived disease timeline and personal control) were significantly associated with WSS. Conclusions: Overall, participants demonstrated good performances in self-managing a wrist-worn device. Digital inequalities may extend to variations in how different individuals feel about their own disease and, consequently, manage the technology.

For women at risk of hypertensive complications, guidelines recommend frequent surveillance of blood pressure and signs of preeclampsia. Clinic visits range from every 2 weeks to several times a week. Given the wide ubiquity of smartphones and computers in most countries and a growing attention for self-management, digital technologies, including mobile health (mHealth), constitute a promising component of monitoring (self-measured) blood pressure during pregnancy. Currently, little is known about the experiences of women using such platforms and how mHealth can be aligned with their needs and preferences. OBJECTIVE: The objectives were twofold: (1) to explore the experiences of Dutch women who had an increased risk of HDP with a blended care approach (mHealth combined with face-to-face care) for remote self-monitoring of blood pressure and preeclampsia symptoms and (2) to formulate recommendations for the use and integration of mHealth in clinical care. METHODS: Alongside a prospective blended care study (SAFE@home study) that monitors pregnant women at increased risk of HPD with mHealth technology, a mixed methods study was conducted, including questionnaires (n=52) and interviews (n=11). Results were analyzed thematically. RESULTS: Of the 4 themes, 2 themes were related to the technologies themselves (expectations, usability), and 2 themes were related to the interaction and use of mHealth (autonomy and responsibilities of patients, responsibilities of health care professionals). First, the digital platform met the expectations of patients, which contributed to user satisfaction. Second, the platform was considered user-friendly, and patients favored different moments and frequencies for measuring their blood pressure. Third, patient autonomy was mentioned in terms of increased insight about their own condition and being able to influence clinical decision making. Fourth, clinical expertise of health care professionals was considered essential to interpret the data, which translates to subsequent responsibilities for clinical management. Data from the questionnaires and interviews corresponded. CONCLUSIONS: Blended care using an mHealth tool to monitor blood pressure in pregnancy was positively evaluated by its users. Insights from participants led to 7 recommendations for designing and implementing similar interventions and to enhance future, morally sound use of digital technologies in clinical care."

Objective: This study aimed to identify positive and negative effects as well as barriers and facilitators for the use of two wearable devices: ViSi Mobile (VM) and HealthPatch (HP). Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, 90 patients admitted to the internal medicine and surgical wards of a university hospital in the Netherlands were randomly assigned to continuous vital sign monitoring using VM or HP and a control group. Users' experiences and expectations were addressed using semistructured interviews. Nurses, physician assistants, and medical doctors were also interviewed. Interviews were analyzed using thematic content analysis. Psychological distress was assessed using the State Trait Anxiety Inventory and the Pain Catastrophizing Scale. The System Usability Scale was used to assess the usability of both devices. Results: A total of 60 patients, 20 nurses, 3 physician assistants, and 6 medical doctors were interviewed. We identified 47 positive and 30 negative effects and 19 facilitators and 36 barriers for the use of VM and HP. Frequently mentioned topics included earlier identification of clinical deterioration, increased feelings of safety, and VM lines and electrodes. No differences related to psychological distress and usability were found between randomization groups or devices. Conclusions: Both devices were well received by most patients and health care professionals, and the majority of them encouraged the idea of monitoring vital signs continuously in the general ward. This comprehensive overview of barriers and facilitators of using wireless devices may serve as a guide for future researchers, developers, and health care institutions that consider implementing continuous monitoring in the ward."

One of the key components of an ICU is the continuous monitoring of patients' vital parameters. However, existing advances in informatics, signal processing, or engineering that could alleviate the burden on ICUs have not yet been applied. This could be due to the lack of user involvement in research and development. Objective: This study focused on the satisfaction of ICU staff with current patient monitoring and their suggestions for future improvements. We aimed to identify aspects of monitoring that interrupt patient care, display devices for remote monitoring, use cases for artificial intelligence (AI), and whether ICU staff members are willing to improve their digital literacy or contribute to the improvement of patient monitoring. We further aimed to identify differences in the responses of different professional groups. Methods: This survey study was performed with ICU staff from 4 ICUs of a German university hospital between November 2019 and January 2020. We developed a web-based 36-item survey questionnaire, by analyzing a preceding qualitative interview study with ICU staff, about the clinical requirements of future patient monitoring. Statistical analyses of questionnaire results included median values with their bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals, and chi-square tests to compare the distributions of item responses of the professional groups. Results: In total, 86 of the 270 ICU physicians and nurses completed the survey questionnaire. The majority stated they felt confident using the patient monitoring equipment, but that high rates of false-positive alarms and the many sensor cables interrupted patient care. Regarding future improvements, respondents asked for wireless sensors, a reduction in the number of false-positive alarms, and hospital standard operating procedures for alarm management. Responses to the display devices proposed for remote patient monitoring were divided. Most respondents indicated it would be useful for earlier alerting or when they were responsible for multiple wards. AI for ICUs would be useful for early detection of complications and an increased risk of mortality; in addition, the AI could propose guidelines for therapy and diagnostics. Transparency, interoperability, usability, and staff training were essential to promote the use of AI. The majority wanted to learn more about new technologies for the ICU and required more time for learning. Physicians had fewer reservations than nurses about AI-based intelligent alarm management and using mobile phones for remote monitoring. Conclusions: This survey study of ICU staff revealed key improvements for patient monitoring in intensive care medicine. Hospital providers and medical device manufacturers should focus on reducing false alarms, implementing hospital alarm standard operating procedures, introducing wireless sensors, preparing for the use of AI, and enhancing the digital literacy of ICU staff. Our results may contribute to the user-centered transfer of digital technologies into practice to alleviate challenges in intensive care medicine."

Elderly gait is a sensitive marker for their health status which enables detection of physical and mental impairments. This study aimed to advance the performance of elderly gait event detection using a single waist-worn IMU sensor through deep learning models. Four deep learning models MLP, CNN, LSTM, and GRU were trained and tested on data from the community-dwelling elderly. The accuracy was measured for six detection delay tolerance ranges. The GRU model achieved the best accuracy of 99.47% at a detection delay tolerance range of ±6TS (±6ms) and 78.98% for a more precise range of ±1TS (±1ms). The proposed method showed significant improvement over previously reported event detection results by achieving an MAE of 8.9ms and 7.6ms for the HS and TO events respectively. The RNN models attained better accuracy for the TO events as compared to HS events. Furthermore, an ablation study was also performed to observe the contribution of the subsets of the six IMU signals from the pelvis to the overall performance of the best model.

Most research in this field has concentrated on collecting sensor data, visualizing it, and analyzing it to detect anomalies in specific diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and depression. However, this domain has a notable gap in the aspect of human-machine interaction. This paper proposes REMONI, an autonomous REmote health MONItoring system that integrates multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the Internet of Things (loT), and wearable devices. The system automatically and continuously collects vital signs, accelerometer data from a special wearable (such as a smartwatch), and visual data in patient video clips collected from cameras. This data is processed by an anomaly detection module, which includes a fall detection model and algorithms to identify and alert caregivers of the patient's emergency conditions. A distinctive feature of our proposed system is the natural lan-guage processing component, developed with MLLMs capable of detecting and recognizing a patient's activity and emotion while responding to healthcare worker's inquiries. Additionally, prompt engineering is employed to integrate all patient information seamlessly. As a result, doctors and nurses can access real-time vital signs and the patient's current state and mood by interacting with an intelligent agent through a user-friendly web application.

Among the existing technologies, digital cameras integrated into smartphones or laptops are widely used due to their ease of use, availability, and portability. In this study, we investigated the influence of distance on the HR estimation from a video recorded with a smartphone's frontal camera. HR values were provided from a spectral analysis every 1 s. We evaluated the performances of six different algorithms to identify the best one for HR estimation simulating an occupational scenario at two distances (i.e., 0.5 m and 1 m). Data were recorded from 8 healthy volunteers of both sexes; a wearable device was used to record medical-grade ECG to estimate reference HR values. Results show that the higher the camera distance, the higher the mean absolute error (MAE): the average MAE was 1.49 bpm at 0.5 m and 2.59 bpm at 1.0 m. Moreover, Green Channel, Chrominance-based signal processing method (CHROM), and Plane Orthogonal to Skin (POS) have been identified as the best algorithms to estimate HR since they showed a better agreement with the reference system than the other algorithms."

Barton,Design of a Multi-Sensors Wearable System for Continuous Home Monitoring of People With Parkinson’s,,"Parkinson’s disease is a degenerative neurological disorder that impairs motor functions and is accompanied by a wide range of non-motor symptoms, such as sleep problems. Parkinsonism is assessed during clinical evaluations and via self-administered diaries and, based on these, the required medication therapies are provided to lessen symptoms. Tri-axial accelerometers and gyroscopes have the potential utility to objectively assess the patient’s condition and aid clinicians in their decision-making. People with Parkinson’s often have significant abnormalities in blood pressure due to comorbid age-related cardiovascular disease and orthostatic hypotension, which result in blurred vision, dizziness, and falls. Frequent blood pressure monitoring may aid in the evaluation of such events and differentiate Parkinson’s disease symptoms from those originated by hypotension. In the present paper, a novel technology for the remote monitoring of Parkinsonian symptoms is presented: the WESAA system. It consists of two devices, worn on the wrist and ankle; its main function is to record accelerations and angular velocities from these body parts, together with photoplethysmograph and electrocardiogram data. This information can be elaborated offline to measure common Parkinson’s disease motor symptoms (e.g., tremor, bradykinesia, and dyskinesia), as well as gait speed, sleep-wake cycles, and cuff-less blood pressure measurements. The overall system requirements, market overview, industrial design and ergonomics, system development, user experience, early results of the gathered inertial raw data, and validation of the photoplethysmograph and electrocardiogram signal waveforms are all thoroughly discussed. The developed technology satisfies all system requirements, and the sensors adopted provided outcomes comparable with gold standard techniques."

Shen,BudsAuth: Toward Gesture-Wise Continuous User Authentication Through Earbuds Vibration Sensing,,"The surge in popularity of wireless headphones, particularly wireless earbuds, as smart wearables, has been notable in recent years. These devices, empowered by artificial intelligence (AI), are broadening their utility in areas such as speech recognition, augmented reality, pose recognition, and health care monitoring, thereby enriching user experiences through novel interactive interfaces driven by embedded sensors. However, the widespread adoption of wireless earbuds has spurred concerns regarding security and privacy, necessitating robust bespoke security measures. Despite the miniaturization of mobile chips enabling the integration of sophisticated algorithms into smart wearables, the research and industrial communities have yet to accord adequate attention to earbud security. This article focuses on empowering wireless earbuds to authenticate their legitimate users, tackling the challenges associated with conventional authentication methods. Instead of relying on input interface authentication methods like PIN or lock patterns, this research delves into leveraging inertial measurement unit (IMU) data collected during interactions with devices to extract novel biometric features, presenting an alternative approach that nonetheless confronts challenges related to signal capture and interference. Consequently, we propose and design BudsAuth, an implicit user authentication framework that harnesses built-in IMU sensors in smart earbuds to capture vibration signals induced by on-face touching interactions with the earbuds. These vibrations are utilized to deliver continuous and implicit user authentication with high precision and compatibility across various earbud models. Extensive evaluation demonstrates BudsAuth’s capability to achieve an equal error rate (EER) of 0.0003, representing an approximate 99.97% accuracy with seven consecutive samples of interactive gestures for implicit authentication."

In particular, activity, respiratory and environmental data are continuously streamed and collected. The solution has been tested on 18 healthy volunteers during non-supervised recordings lasting at least 48 hours. The combination of recognized activities and associated respiratory parameters provided statistically significant variations in breathing patterns between one activity and the other, thus giving more complete information to the clinicians than previously studied telemedicine systems based on spot-checks. In particular, statistically significant differences are found in tidal volume and minute ventilation between horizontal and vertical postures (p < 0.001) and between vertical postures and dynamic activities (p < 0.001); the respiratory rate shows statistically significant differences between horizontal and vertical postures (p < 0.001). Some environmental parameters have different mean values between day and night, such as carbon dioxide (p < 0.001).

Deshayes,Developing a Mobile COVID-19 Prototype Management Application Integrated With an Electronic Health Record for Effective Management in Hospitals,,"This article aimed to develop a mobile application for the management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We analyzed the pilot version with satisfaction through a survey and an interview with health workers from Sidi Said, a local hospital located in Meknès, Morocco, which receives patients suffering from COVID-19. Methods: We have formed a team effort that involves health professionals, specialists from various fields and who participated in the design process of this project. It is a review of the existing literature and interviews with health professionals seeking to trace all the functions of this application. The user interface graphics, whether at the hospital or patient application level, were reviewed for effective usability by a multidisciplinary team. After having had to develop the pilot version of the application, the usefulness and the gratitude of the application were evaluated by eight patients and carers by means of a utility test, based on a real scenario, a utility survey. The objective is to ensure communication between the mobile application and the decision support application at the emergency services level to facilitate the detection of people who had developed COVID-19 as well as follow-up at home for detected patients. Results: The COVID-19 mobile management application provides capture functions and can afford information that helps in the prescription of appropriate drugs to patients at home. It is used to identify people who have been in contact with people who have tested positive for COVID-19, to carry out a large-scale screening by sending alert messages to these people, and to follow up via geolocation. There is also the possibility via Bluetooth, for the monitoring of patients without the activation of the Geolocation option. The approach adopted aims to reduce congestion in hospitals by identifying people suffering from respiratory illnesses or who may be contaminated, and monitoring them remotely. We offered six functions to achieve the objective of this project. Main: Respiratory crisis journal, medication recall, appointment, survey of people contacted, personal equipment and dashboard, daily traceability and monitoring, and geolocation. We have integrated the application of the electronic healthcare registration system in hospitals. To simplify usability, the frequently used functions, which are relatively important, can be found on the main page under the heading “COVID-19 monitoring” (in French: COVID-19 monitoring), and “Medication log” (in French: Journal medication). In addition, during graphic design, art therapy was used to improve the psychological stability of the patient. Eight participants were employed for the evaluation. For scenario-based tasks, out of ten tasks, all participants can record the entries in detail. The system use scale score was 94 points, indicating that the system was satisfactory for the patients and the staff who tested and manipulated it. Conclusion: This article confirmed that patients were satisfied with the follow-up at home and with the caregivers of the hospital. In addition, this made it possible to accurately record their symptoms and, therefore, facilitated an early detection of COVID-19. This was very useful for analyzing crisis trends, responding to a broader detection, avoiding contamination within the same family and provide effective support for COVID-19 positive patients at home. Through integration with the electronic health record, patient health care information can be used by health care decision-makers to manage treatment plans and support medical interventions. Currently, all patients who have been followed remotely are cured. We intend to generalize this concept for the monitoring of other diseases than COVID-19 later."

Duerstock,Automated Detection of Symptomatic Autonomic Dysreflexia Through Multimodal Sensing,,"Objective: Autonomic Dysreflexia (AD) is a potentially life-threatening syndrome which occurs in individuals with higher level spinal cord injuries (SCI). AD is caused by triggers which can lead to rapid escalation of pathophysiological responses and if the trigger is not removed, AD can be fatal. There is currently no objective, non-invasive and accurate monitoring system available to automatically detect the onset of AD symptoms in real time in a non-clinical setting. Technology or Method: We developed a user-independent method of symptomatic AD detection in real time with a wearable physiological telemetry system (PTS) and a machine learning model using data from eleven participants with SCI. Results: The PTS could detect onset of AD symptoms with an average accuracy of 94.10% and a false negative rate of 4.89%. Conclusions: The PTS can detect the onset of the symptoms AD with high sensitivity and specificity to assist people with SCIs in preventing the occurrence of AD. It would enable persons with high level SCIs to be more independent and pursue vocational activities while granting continuous medical oversight. Clinical Impact: The PTS could serve as a supplementary tool to current solutions to detect the onset of AD and prepare individuals who are newly injured to be better prepared for AD episodes. Moreover, it could be translated into a system to encourage individuals to practice better healthcare management to prevent future occurrences."

J,VitalLink: NodeMCU IoT Solution for Vital Signs Surveillance,,"This research study proposes the development of comprehensive vital sign surveillance designed for real-time patient assessment. The system integrates multiple sensors, including the LM35 temperature sensor, Heartbeat Rate (HBR) and Blood Oxygen (SpO2) Sensor, DHT11 humidity and temperature sensor, OLED display, and gyroscope sensor, to provide a holistic approach to vital signs. The LM35 sensor is employed for accurate temperature measurement, providing crucial data for monitoring the patient's thermal status. This information is essential for detecting fever or abnormal temperature variations, aiding in the early identification of potential health issues. The HBR and SpO2 sensor plays a vital role in cardiovascular vital signs. The system can assess the patient's cardiac and respiratory well-being by measuring the heart rate and blood oxygen levels. Abnormalities in these parameters can trigger timely alerts, enabling swift medical intervention. The DHT11 sensor enhances the system's capabilities by monitoring ambient temperature and humidity. This additional environmental data contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the patient's surroundings, ensuring that external factors are considered in the health assessment process. Integrating an OLED display serves as an intuitive user interface, providing real-time feedback on the measured parameters. This ensures that patients and healthcare providers can easily interpret and respond to the health data presented by the system. The display can showcase temperature, humidity, heart rate, blood oxygen levels, and other relevant information in a user-friendly format. Furthermore, the gyroscope sensor adds a layer of sophistication to vital sign surveillance by enabling the assessment of body movement and posture. This feature is particularly beneficial for patients with mobility issues or those prone to falls. The gyroscope data can be analyzed to detect sudden movements or abnormal postures, triggering alerts to caregivers or healthcare professionals. The system is designed for user convenience, ensuring ease of use and portability. Wireless connectivity options can be incorporated, allowing data to be transmitted to a centralized monitoring platform or a mobile application. This enables remote monitoring, facilitating timely interventions and improving patient outcomes. The proposed vital sign surveillance has the potential to revolutionize personalized healthcare by providing continuous, non-intrusive monitoring in real time. The multi-sensor integration allows for a more nuanced and comprehensive assessment of the patient's health status, enabling early detection of potential issues and facilitating proactive healthcare interventions."

Zeadally,GaRuDa: A Blockchain-Based Delivery Scheme Using Drones for Healthcare 5.0 Applications,,"Over the years, the healthcare industry has transformed from being hospital-centric to patient-centric. This shift is mainly due to the convergence of emergent technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT)-based healthcare, fifth generation (5G)-assisted networking, and data-driven analytics through artificial intelligence. The convergence, referred to as Healthcare 5.0, has improved healthcare services to support real-time analytics, user mobility, remote monitoring, and personalized user experience through decentralized applications. However, the medical supply chain systems and delivery operations among healthcare stakeholders suffer from limitations of harsh environmental conditions due to restricted zones, rough terrains, war-prone areas, poor road conditions, congested traffic, and remote locations. Thus, the Internet of Drones (IoD) is deployed in Healthcare 5.0 supply chains to streamline and expedite the medical delivery process through open channels (i.e. the Internet). However, the Internet is an open channel that is prone to malicious activities which can violate the privacy and confidentiality of patient data. Blockchain is a promising technology that can handle the security and reliability of drone delivery among untrusted open channels. Motivated by the aforementioned facts, we propose GaRuDa, a blockchain-based drone delivery scheme for Healthcare 5.0 applications. The proposed scheme integrates IoD and blockchain through 5G-enabled tactile Internet to facilitate low-latency responsive delivery of medical supplies that can be chronologically monitored and tracked among different stakeholders. We compared the proposed scheme with the traditional medical delivery scheme with payment gateways to demonstrate its effectiveness in terms of data storage, computation, and communication costs. The simulation results obtained show that the average transaction cost has been reduced by ≈ 44.56 percent, and 5G tactile Internet has a reduced latency of 0.051 ms compared to 18.3 ms in 4G LTE service. The average communication overheads have reduced by ≈ 67.34 percent compared to traditional 4G LTE and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing channels, which indicates the scheme's viability."

Dijk; D. P. Mandic,From Scalp to Ear-EEG: A Generalizable Transfer Learning Model for Automatic Sleep Scoring in Older People,,"Objective: Sleep monitoring has extensively utilized electroencephalogram (EEG) data collected from the scalp, yielding very large data repositories and well-trained analysis models. Yet, this wealth of data is lacking for emerging, less intrusive modalities, such as ear-EEG.Methods and procedures: The current study seeks to harness the abundance of open-source scalp EEG datasets by applying models pre-trained on data, either directly or with minimal fine-tuning; this is achieved in the context of effective sleep analysis from ear-EEG data that was recorded using a single in-ear electrode, referenced to the ipsilateral mastoid, and developed in-house as described in our previous work. Unlike previous studies, our research uniquely focuses on an older cohort (17 subjects aged 65-83, mean age 71.8 years, some with health conditions), and employs LightGBM for transfer learning, diverging from previous deep learning approaches. Results: Results show that the initial accuracy of the pre-trained model on ear-EEG was 70.1%, but fine-tuning the model with ear-EEG data improved its classification accuracy to 73.7%. The fine-tuned model exhibited a statistically significant improvement (p < 0.05, dependent t-test) for 10 out of the 13 participants, as reflected by an enhanced average Cohen’s kappa score (a statistical measure of inter-rater agreement for categorical items) of 0.639, indicating a stronger agreement between automated and expert classifications of sleep stages. Comparative SHAP value analysis revealed a shift in feature importance for the N3 sleep stage, underscoring the effectiveness of the fine-tuning process.Conclusion: Our findings underscore the potential of fine-tuning pre-trained scalp EEG models on ear-EEG data to enhance classification accuracy, particularly within an older population and using feature-based methods for transfer learning. This approach presents a promising avenue for ear-EEG analysis in sleep studies, offering new insights into the applicability of transfer learning across different populations and computational techniques.Clinical impact: An enhanced ear-EEG method could be pivotal in remote monitoring settings, allowing for continuous, non-invasive sleep quality assessment in elderly patients with conditions like dementia or sleep apnea."

The aim of this study was to assess the usability of continuous home-monitoring care with an oxygen saturation device on post-COVID-19 patients. METHOD: The system consists of a digital continuous pulse oximeter and a smartphone with an App, which were provided to patients. A survey composed of a standard Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire, and a satisfaction questionnaire was exploited to conduct a usability and feasibility analysis of the service. RESULTS: A total of 29 patients (17.2% female) with a mean age of 65 ± 11.5 years were enrolled: 20 patients were smartphone users (69%) with a mean age of 60.2 ± 9.5 years, and 9 patients (31%) did not own a smartphone (mean age 76.8 ± 5.9). The monitoring period was 1 month: a total of 444 recordings were conducted, 15 recordings per patient averagely. In total, 82% of the recordings performed did not require any intervention, while 18% led to the production of a report and subsequent intervention by a nurse who verified, together with the specialist, the need to intervene (i.e. the patient accessed the clinic for medical control and/or modification of oxygen therapy). A total of 17 patients compiled a usability questionnaire. The service was perceived as useful and well-structured, although it often required caregiver support. CONCLUSIONS: Using continuous home-monitoring care with an oxygen saturation device seems feasible and useful for patients who could be followed at home avoiding going back to the hospital every time a trend oximetry is needed. Further improvements in connections, data flow processes, and simplifications, based on patients' feedback, are needed to scale up the service."

However, there is skepticism that age and cognitive or functional impairment may render participants unable or unwilling to comply with complex RMT protocols. We therefore assessed the feasibility and usability of a complex RMT protocol in all syndromic stages of Alzheimer's disease and in healthy control participants. METHODS: For 8 weeks, participants (N = 229) used two activity trackers, two interactive apps with either daily or weekly cognitive tasks, and optionally a wearable camera. A subset of participants participated in a 4-week sub-study (N = 45) using fixed at-home sensors, a wearable EEG sleep headband and a driving performance device. Feasibility was assessed by evaluating compliance and drop-out rates. Usability was assessed by problem rates (e.g., understanding instructions, discomfort, forgetting to use the RMT or technical problems) as discussed during bi-weekly semi-structured interviews. RESULTS: Most problems were found for the active apps and EEG sleep headband. Problem rates increased and compliance rates decreased with disease severity, but the study remained feasible. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that a highly complex RMT protocol is feasible, even in a mild-to-moderate AD population, encouraging other researchers to use RMTs in their study designs. We recommend evaluating the design of individual devices carefully before finalizing study protocols, considering RMTs which allow for real-time compliance monitoring, and engaging the partners of study participants in the research."

The integration of new wearable and mobile technologies to collect electroencephalographic (EEG) and extracerebral signals in a portable system might be the solution to prospectively identify times of seizure occurrence or propensity. The performances of several seizure detection devices have been assessed by validated studies, and patient perspectives on wearables have been explored to better match their needs. Despite this, there is a major gap in the literature on long-term, real-life acceptability and performance of mobile technology essential to managing chronic disorders such as epilepsy. OBJECTIVE: EEG@HOME is an observational, nonrandomized, noninterventional study that aims to develop a new feasible procedure that allows people with epilepsy to independently, continuously, and safely acquire noninvasive variables at home. The data collected will be analyzed to develop a general model to predict periods of increased seizure risk. METHODS: A total of 12 adults with a diagnosis of pharmaco-resistant epilepsy and at least 20 seizures per year will be recruited at King's College Hospital, London. Participants will be asked to self-apply an easy and portable EEG recording system (ANT Neuro) to record scalp EEG at home twice daily. From each serial EEG recording, brain network ictogenicity (BNI), a new biomarker of the propensity of the brain to develop seizures, will be extracted. A noninvasive wrist-worn device (Fitbit Charge 3; Fitbit Inc) will be used to collect non-EEG biosignals (heart rate, sleep quality index, and steps), and a smartphone app (Seer app; Seer Medical) will be used to collect data related to seizure occurrence, medication taken, sleep quality, stress, and mood. All data will be collected continuously for 6 months. Standardized questionnaires (the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire and System Usability Scale) will be completed to assess the acceptability and feasibility of the procedure. BNI, continuous wrist-worn sensor biosignals, and electronic survey data will be correlated with seizure occurrence as reported in the diary to investigate their potential values as biomarkers of seizure risk. RESULTS: The EEG@HOME project received funding from Epilepsy Research UK in 2018 and was approved by the Bromley Research Ethics Committee in March 2020. The first participants were enrolled in October 2020, and we expect to publish the first results by the end of 2022. CONCLUSIONS: With the EEG@HOME study, we aim to take advantage of new advances in remote monitoring technology, including self-applied EEG, to investigate the feasibility of long-term disease self-monitoring. Further, we hope our study will bring new insights into noninvasively collected personalized risk factors of seizure occurrence and seizure propensity that may help to mitigate one of the most difficult aspects of refractory epilepsy: the unpredictability of seizure occurrence.

They are unpleasant for patients and sometimes severe enough to cause hospital admission and death. Moreover, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, vulnerable populations with these disorders are at high risk, and their routine care cannot be done properly. Remote monitoring offers a low cost and safe solution for gaining visibility into the health of people in their daily lives, making it useful for vulnerable populations. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of remote monitoring using wearables and mobile phones in patients with pulmonary diseases. The secondary objective is to provide power calculations for future studies centered around understanding the number of exacerbations according to sample size and duration. METHODS: Twenty participants will be recruited in each of three cohorts (COPD, IPF, and posthospitalization COVID). Data collection will be done remotely using the RADAR-Base (Remote Assessment of Disease And Relapse) mobile health (mHealth) platform for different devices, including Garmin wearable devices and smart spirometers, mobile app questionnaires, surveys, and finger pulse oximeters. Passive data include wearable-derived continuous heart rate, oxygen saturation, respiration rate, activity, and sleep. Active data include disease-specific patient-reported outcome measures, mental health questionnaires, and symptom tracking to track disease trajectory. Analyses will assess the feasibility of lung disorder remote monitoring (including data quality, data completeness, system usability, and system acceptability). We will attempt to explore disease trajectory, patient stratification, and identification of acute clinical events such as exacerbations. A key aspect is understanding the potential of real-time data collection. We will simulate an intervention to acquire responses at the time of the event to assess model performance for exacerbation identification. RESULTS: The Remote Assessment of Lung Disease and Impact on Physical and Mental Health (RALPMH) study provides a unique opportunity to assess the use of remote monitoring in the evaluation of lung disorders. The study started in the middle of June 2021. The data collection apparatus, questionnaires, and wearable integrations were setup and tested by the clinical teams prior to the start of recruitment. While recruitment is ongoing, real-time exacerbation identification models are currently being constructed. The models will be pretrained daily on data of previous days, but the inference will be run in real time. CONCLUSIONS: The RALPMH study will provide a reference infrastructure for remote monitoring of lung diseases. It specifically involves information regarding the feasibility and acceptability of remote monitoring and the potential of real-time data collection and analysis in the context of chronic lung disorders. It will help plan and inform decisions in future studies in the area of respiratory health. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN Registry ISRCTN16275601; https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN16275601.

Although product usability is a crucial aspect of users' acceptance of a wearable device, usability studies in wearable devices are rare, with most studies focusing primarily on clinical validity. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the usability of a wristwatch device called ""Smart reminder"" for home-based upper limb telerehabilitation for persons with stroke. METHODS: Eleven stroke participants used the proposed wristwatch for at least two weeks and underwent a home-based telerehabilitation program. A mixed-methods design was used to explore the usability of the wristwatch. Quantitative data were collected through the System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire, and the participants' rate of therapy compliance (gathered from the device) was reported descriptively. In addition, qualitative data were collected through semi-structured interviews with the participants and were analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that the usability of the proposed wristwatch and telerehabilitation system was rated highly by the participants, with a high SUS mean score of 84.3 (12.3) and high therapy compliance rate (mean  =  91%). Qualitatively, all participants reported positive experiences with the wristwatch and indicated keenness to use it again. Participants reported physical improvements and felt motivated to exercise after using the wristwatch. They found the device easy and convenient and appreciated the remote monitoring function. Meanwhile, they highlighted critical considerations for the design of the device and program, including technical support, a wearable design of the device, graded exercise content according to ability, and flexibility in exercise schedules. Finally, they suggested that an interim review with the therapist on their progress might help them continue using the wristwatch. CONCLUSIONS: This study's results supported the proposed wearable device's usability and showed strong acceptance by the participants for using it as a home-based upper limb telerehabilitation intervention."

Although mHealth could be used to facilitate the tracking of health changes during pregnancy, challenges remain in data collection compliance and technology engagement among pregnant women. Understanding the interests, preferences, and requirements of pregnant women and those of clinicians is needed when designing and introducing mHealth solutions for supporting pregnant women's monitoring of health and risk factors throughout their pregnancy journey. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand clinicians' and pregnant women's perceptions on the potential use of mHealth, including factors that may influence their engagement with mHealth technologies and the implications for technology design and implementation. METHODS: A qualitative study using semistructured interviews was conducted with 4 pregnant women, 4 postnatal women, and 13 clinicians working in perinatal care. RESULTS: Clinicians perceived the potential benefit of mHealth in supporting different levels of health and well-being monitoring, risk assessment, and care provision in pregnancy care. Most pregnant and postnatal female participants were open to the use of wearables and health monitoring devices and were more likely to use these technologies if they knew that clinicians were monitoring their data. Although it was acknowledged that some pregnancy-related medical conditions are suitable for an mHealth model of remote monitoring, the clinical and technical challenges in the introduction of mHealth for pregnancy care were also identified. Incorporating appropriate health and well-being measures, intelligently detecting any abnormalities, and providing tailored information for pregnant women were the critical aspects, whereas usability and data privacy were among the main concerns of the participants. Moreover, this study highlighted the challenges of engaging pregnant women in longitudinal mHealth monitoring, the additional work required for clinicians to monitor the data, and the need for an evidence-based technical solution. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical, technical, and practical factors associated with the use of mHealth to monitor health and well-being in pregnant women need to be considered during the design and feasibility evaluation stages. Technical solutions and appropriate strategies for motivating pregnant women are critical to supporting their long-term data collection compliance and engagement with mHealth technology during pregnancy."

However, the digital phenotype, which refers to the analysis of data collected by measuring human behavior with mobile sensors and smart bracelets, is a promising tool for filling this gap in current clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study are to develop the digital phenotyping of patients with alcohol use disorder and anxiety symptoms using data collected from a mobile device (ie, smartphone) and a wearable sensor (ie, Fitbit) and to analyze usability and patient satisfaction with the data collection service provided by the app. METHODS: We propose to conduct a study among a group of 60 participants split into two subgroups-experimental and control-of 30 participants each. The experimental group will be recruited by physicians from the Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, and the control group will be recruited on a volunteer basis through fliers and social media. All participants will go through pretraining to ensure technological capability and understanding of tasks, then each participant will download the HumanITcare app and will be given a wearable sensor (ie, Fitbit). Throughout the 4-month period, participants will be monitored on a range of factors, including sleep cycle, heart rate, movement patterns, and sociability. All data from the wearable sensors and the mobile devices will be saved and sent to the HumanITcare server. Participants will be asked to complete weekly questionnaires about anxiety, depression, and alcohol use disorder symptoms. Research assistants will ensure timely responses. The data from both sensors will then be compared to the questionnaire responses to determine how accurately the devices can predict the same symptoms. RESULTS: The recruitment phase was completed in November 2019 and all the data were collected by the end of December 2019. Data are being processed; this process is expected to be completed by October 2020. CONCLUSIONS: This study was created and conducted as a pilot study with the Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, with the purpose of exploring the feasibility of our approach. The study is focused on patients diagnosed with anxiety and alcohol use disorder, but participants were also monitored for depressive symptoms throughout the trial, although these were not part of the initial inclusion criteria. A limitation to our study was the exclusive use of Android smartphones over iOS devices; this could result in a potential selection bias, due to the accessibility and affordability of Android phones as opposed to iOS-based phones. Another limitation might be that reviews of usability and satisfaction could be confounded by factors such as age and familiarity. An additional function that we might add in future studies is the ability for patients to manage their own data. INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): DERR1-10.2196/16964."

Vestibular physical therapy (VPT) is a specialised, non-invasive and effective therapy for these problems but usually involves travel for the person to a specialist center with both personal and carbon costs. The use of wearable sensors to track head movement and smartphone applications to deliver and track programs has potential to improve VPT in MS. METHODS: This study investigated the usability and effects of a commercially available digital VPT system (wearable head sensor, smartphone app and clinician software) to deliver VPT to PwMS. A pre/post treatment design was employed and the primary outcome was the System Usability Scale (SUS). Other patient reported outcomes were the Service User Acceptability Questionnaire (SUTAQ), the Patient Enablement Instrument (PEI) and the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI). Physical outcomes measurements included Mini-BESTest (MB), Modified Dynamic Gait Index (mDGI), Gait Speed (GS), Dynamic Visual Acuity (DVA) and head kinematics and symptoms during exercise. RESULTS: Sixteen PwMS (14 female), mean age 44(±14) years were recruited to the study and twelve completed VPT. Mean adherence to exercise, measured digitally was 60% (±18.4). SUS scores were high at 81 (±14) and SUTAQ scores also demonstrated high levels of satisfaction and acceptability of the system. Statistically significant improvements in MB (mean change 2.25; p = 0.004), mDGI (median change 1.00; p = 0.008), DVA (median change -1.00; p = 0.004) were found. Head frequencies significantly improved with concurrent decreased intensity of dizziness during head movements (mean change across 4 gaze stabilization exercises was 23 beats per minute; p < 0.05). Non-significant improvements were seen in DHI (p = 0.07) and GS (p = 0.15). 64.5% of follow up visits were conducted remotely (video or phone), facilitated by the system. DISCUSSION: This study had two main outcomes and benefits for PwMS. Firstly, we showed that the system used was both acceptable and could be used by PwMS. Secondly, we demonstrated an improvement in a range of dizziness, balance and gait metrics with remotely delivered care. This system has the potential to positively impact on MS physiotherapy service provision with the potential to deliver effective remote care."

Implantable hemodynamic monitoring is being tested to anticipate the clinical exacerbation onset, potentially preventing an emergent acute decompensation. To date, only pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) sensor received the approval to be implanted in symptomatic heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction. However, PAP's indirect estimation of left ventricular filling pressure can be inaccurate in some contexts. METHODS: The VECTOR-HF study (NCT03775161) is examining the safety, usability and performance of the V-LAP system, a latest-generation device capable of continuously monitoring left atrial pressure (LAP). In our center, five advanced HF patients have been enrolled. After confirmation of the transmitted data reliability, LAP trends and waveforms have guided therapy optimization. The aim of this work is to share clinical insights from our center preliminary experience with V-LAP application. RESULTS: Over a median follow-up time of 18 months, LAP-based therapy optimization managed to reduce intracardiac pressure over time and no hospital readmission occurred. This result was paralleled by an improvement in both functional capacity (6MWT distance 352.5 ± 86.2 meters at baseline to 441.2 ± 125.2 meters at last follow-up) and quality of life indicators (KCCQ overall score 63.82 ± 16.36 vs. 81.92 ± 9.63; clinical score 68.47 ± 19.48 vs. 83.70 ± 15.58). CONCLUSION: Preliminary evidence from V-LAP application at our institution support a promising efficacy. However, further study is needed to confirm the technical reliability of the device and to exploit the clinical benefit of left-sided hemodynamic remote monitoring."

Continuous remote monitoring of physiological parameters and symptom changes offers the potential for timely intervention, improved patient outcomes, and reduced health care costs. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated whether a real-time multimodal program using commercially available wearable technology, home-based Bluetooth-enabled spirometers, finger pulse oximeters, and smartphone apps is feasible and acceptable for patients with chronic respiratory diseases, as well as the value of low-burden, long-term passive data collection. METHODS: In a 3-arm prospective observational cohort feasibility study, we recruited 60 patients from the Royal Free Hospital and University College Hospital. These patients had been diagnosed with interstitial lung disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or post-COVID-19 condition (n=20 per group) and were followed for 180 days. This study used a comprehensive remote monitoring system designed to provide real-time and relevant data for both patients and clinicians. Data were collected using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture; Vanderbilt University) periodic surveys, Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapses-base active app questionnaires, wearables, finger pulse oximeters, smartphone apps, and Bluetooth home-based spirometry. The feasibility of remote monitoring was measured through adherence to the protocol, engagement during the follow-up period, retention rate, acceptability, and data integrity. RESULTS: Lowest-burden passive data collection methods, via wearables, demonstrated superior adherence, engagement, and retention compared with active data collection methods, with an average wearable use of 18.66 (SD 4.69) hours daily (77.8% of the day), 123.91 (SD 33.73) hours weekly (72.6% of the week), and 463.82 (SD 156.70) hours monthly (64.4% of the month). Highest-burden spirometry tasks and high-burden active app tasks had the lowest adherence, engagement, and retention, followed by low-burden questionnaires. Spirometry and active questionnaires had the lowest retention at 0.5 survival probability, indicating that they were the most burdensome. Adherence to and quality of home spirometry were analyzed; of the 7200 sessions requested, 4248 (59%) were performed. Of these, 90.3% (3836/4248) were of acceptable quality according to American Thoracic Society grading. Inclusion of protocol holidays improved retention measures. The technologies used were generally well received. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide evidence supporting the feasibility and acceptability of remote monitoring for capturing both subjective and objective data from various sources for respiratory diseases. The high engagement level observed with passively collected data suggests the potential of wearables for long-term, user-friendly remote monitoring in respiratory disease management. The unique piloting of certain features such as protocol holidays, alert notifications for missing data, and flexible support from the study team provides a reference for future studies in this field.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Fifteen participants aged 7-65 years with type 1 diabetes participating in a longitudinal study used a Medtronic® advanced hybrid closed loop (AHCL) device with initially calibration-requiring then calibration-free sensors. Qualitative interviews were conducted ≥20 weeks following use of the calibration-requiring and ≥4 weeks after use of the calibration-free sensors/remote monitoring. Thematic analysis was used to identify key themes and subthemes. RESULTS: At baseline, mean diabetes duration was 14.5 years ( ± 10.9), mean Hba1c 54.8 mmol/mol ( ± 10.2) (7.2 ± 0.9%) and Time in range 75.4% ( ± 11.6). Participants reported a progressive improvement in digital and lifestyle integration, and device trust following transition to calibration-free sensors with remote monitoring potential. They also reported a reduced need for capillary glucose, increased device satisfaction and trust, and reduced burden of diabetes care. Negative aspects reported included periodic early sensor loss, and for some, impaired integration with mobile devices. CONCLUSION: Transitioning to calibration-free sensors with remote monitoring while using AHCL was associated with better user experience, including perceptions of improved quality of life and a reduced burden of diabetes care. Appropriate expectation setting, training, and ongoing support allow for the optimal user experience while using AHCL.

However, the preparation of multifunctional flexible electronics with high sensitivity, broad sensing range, fast response, efficient healability, and reliable antibacterial capability is still a substantial challenge. Herein, bioinspired by the highly sensitive human skin microstructure (protective epidermis/spinous sensing structure/nerve conduction network), a skin bionic multifunctional electronics is prepared by face-to-face assembly of a newly prepared healable, recyclable, and antibacterial polyurethane elastomer matrix with conductive MXene nanosheets-coated microdome array after ingenious templating method as protective epidermis layer/sensing layer, and an interdigitated electrode as signal transmission layer. The polyurethane elastomer matrix functionalized with triple dynamic bonds (reversible hydrogen bonds, oxime carbamate bonds, and copper (II) ion coordination bonds) is newly prepared, demonstrating excellent healability with highly healing efficiency, robust recyclability, and reliable antibacterial capability, as well as good biocompatibility. Benefiting from the superior mechanical performance of the polyurethane elastomer matrix and the unique skin bionic microstructure of the sensor, the as-assembled flexible electronics exhibit admirable sensing performances featuring ultrahigh sensitivity (up to 1573.05 kPa(-1) ), broad sensing range (up to 325 kPa), good reproducibility, the fast response time (≈4 ms), and low detection limit (≈0.98 Pa) in diagnostic human healthcare monitoring, excellent healability, and reliable antibacterial performance."

Many of these symptoms can be monitored by eHealth solutions, including smartphone apps, wearable sensors, and camera systems. The usability of such systems is a key factor in long-term use, but not much is known about the predictors of successful use and preferable methods to assess usability in patients with PD. OBJECTIVE: This study tested methods to assess usability and determined prerequisites for successful use in patients with PD. METHODS: We performed comprehensive usability assessments with 18 patients with PD using a mixed methods usability battery containing the System Usability Scale, a rater-based evaluation of device-specific tasks, and qualitative interviews. Each patient performed the usability battery with 2 of 3 randomly assigned devices: a tablet app, wearable sensors, and a camera system. The usability battery was administered at the beginning and at the end of a 4-day testing period. Between usability batteries, the systems were used by the patients during 3 sessions of motor assessments (wearable sensors and camera system) and at the movement disorder ward (tablet app). RESULTS: In this study, the rater-based evaluation of tasks discriminated the best between the 3 eHealth solutions, whereas subjective modalities such as the System Usability Scale were not able to distinguish between the systems. Successful use was associated with different clinical characteristics for each system: eHealth literacy and cognitive function predicted successful use of the tablet app, and better motor function and lower age correlated with the independent use of the camera system. The successful use of the wearable sensors was independent of clinical characteristics. Unfortunately, patients who were not able to use the devices well provided few improvement suggestions in qualitative interviews. CONCLUSIONS: eHealth solutions should be developed with a specific set of patients in mind and subsequently tested in this cohort. For a complete picture, usability assessments should include a rater-based evaluation of task performance, and there is a need to develop strategies to circumvent the underrepresentation of poorly performing patients in qualitative usability research."

Within eHealth, wearable technology is increasingly being adopted because it can offer the remote monitoring of chronic and acute conditions in daily life environments. Wearable technology may be used to monitor and track key indicators of physical and psychological stress in daily life settings, providing helpful information for clinicians. One of the key challenges is to present extensive wearable data to clinicians in an easily interpretable manner to make informed decisions. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this research was to design a wearable data dashboard, named CarePortal, to present analytic visualizations of wearable data that are meaningful to clinicians. The study was divided into 2 main research objectives: to understand the needs of clinicians regarding wearable data interpretation and visualization and to develop a system architecture for a web application to visualize wearable data and related analytics. METHODS: We used a wearable data set collected from 116 adolescent participants who experienced trauma. For 2 weeks, participants wore a Microsoft Band that logged physiological sensor data such as heart rate (HR). A total of 834 days of HR data were collected. To design the CarePortal dashboard, we used a participatory design approach that interacted directly with clinicians (stakeholders) with backgrounds in clinical psychology and neuropsychology. A total of 8 clinicians were recruited from the Rhode Island Hospital and the University of Massachusetts Memorial Health. The study involved 5 stages of participatory workshops and began with an understanding of the needs of clinicians. A User Experience Questionnaire was used at the end of the study to quantitatively evaluate user experience. Physiological metrics such as daily and hourly maximum, minimum, average, and SD of HR and HR variability, along with HR-based activity levels, were identified. This study investigated various data visualization graphing methods for wearable data, including radar charts, stacked bar plots, scatter plots combined with line plots, simple bar plots, and box plots. RESULTS: We created a CarePortal dashboard after understanding the clinicians' needs. Results from our workshops indicate that overall clinicians preferred aggregate information such as daily HR instead of continuous HR and want to see trends in wearable sensor data over a period (eg, days). In the User Experience Questionnaire, a score of 1.4 was received, which indicated that CarePortal was exciting to use (question 5), and a similar score was received, indicating that CarePortal was the leading edge (question 8). On average, clinicians reported that CarePortal was supportive and can be useful in making informed decisions. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that the CarePortal dashboard integrated with wearable sensor data visualization techniques would be an acceptable tool for clinicians to use in the future."

The integration of innovative technologies, such as the Internet of Things, wearable technologies, artificial intelligence, and ambient-assisted living applications, represents a valuable solution for this scope. Designing such an integrated system requires addressing several aspects (eg, equipment selection, data management, analytics, costs, and users' needs) and involving different areas of expertise (eg, medical science, service design, biomedical and computer engineering). OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is 2-fold; we aimed to design the functionalities of a smart health platform addressing 5 chronic conditions prevalent in the older population (ie, hearing loss, cardiovascular diseases, cognitive impairments, mental health problems, and balance disorders) by considering both older adults' and clinicians' perspectives and to evaluate the identified smart health platform functionalities with a small group of older adults. METHODS: Overall, 24 older adults (aged >65 years) and 118 clinicians were interviewed through focus group activities and web-based questionnaires to elicit the smart health platform requirements. Considering the elicited requirements, the main functionalities of smart health platform were designed. Then, a focus group involving 6 older adults was conducted to evaluate the proposed solution in terms of usefulness, credibility, desirability, and learnability. RESULTS: Eight main functionalities were identified and assessed-cognitive training and hearing training (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 6/6, 100%; learnability: 6/6, 100%), monitoring of physiological parameters (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 6/6, 100%; learnability: 5/6, 83%), physical training (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 5/6, 83%; learnability: 2/6, 33%), psychoeducational intervention (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 4/6, 67%; learnability: 2/6, 33%), mood monitoring (usefulness: 4/6, 67%; credibility: 4/6, 67%; desirability: 3/6, 50%; learnability: 5/6, 50%), diet plan (usefulness: 5/6, 83%; credibility: 4/6, 67%; desirability: 1/6, 17%; learnability: 2/6, 33%), and environment monitoring and adjustment (usefulness: 1/6, 17%; credibility: 1/6, 17%; desirability: 0/6, 0%; learnability: 0/6, 0%). Most of them were highly appreciated by older participants, with the only exception being environment monitoring and adjustment. The results showed that the proposed functionalities met the needs and expectations of users (eg, improved self-management of patients' disease and enhanced patient safety). However, some aspects need to be addressed (eg, technical and privacy issues). CONCLUSIONS: The presented smart health platform functionalities seem to be able to meet older adults' needs and desires to enhance their self-awareness and self-management of their medical condition, encourage healthy and independent living, and provide evidence-based support for clinicians' decision-making. Further research with a larger and more heterogeneous pool of stakeholders in terms of demographics and clinical conditions is needed to assess system acceptability and overall user experience in free-living conditions."

The National Institutes of Health called on digital health leaders to contribute to a high-quality data repository that will support researchers to make discoveries that are otherwise not possible with small, limited data sets. OBJECTIVE: To this end, we seek to develop a COVID-19 digital biomarker for early detection of physiological exacerbation or decompensation. We propose the development and validation of a COVID-19 decompensation Index (CDI) in a 2-phase study that builds on existing wearable biosensor-derived analytics generated by physIQ's end-to-end cloud platform for continuous physiological monitoring with wearable biosensors. This effort serves to achieve two primary objectives: (1) to collect adequate data to help develop the CDI and (2) to collect rich deidentified clinical data correlating with outcomes and symptoms related to COVID-19 progression. Our secondary objectives include evaluation of the feasibility and usability of pinpointIQ, a digital platform through which data are gathered, analyzed, and displayed. METHODS: This is a prospective, nonrandomized, open-label, 2-phase study. Phase I will involve data collection for the digital data hub of the National Institutes of Health as well as data to support the preliminary development of the CDI. Phase II will involve data collection for the hub and contribute to continued refinement and validation of the CDI. While this study will focus on the development of a CDI, the digital platform will also be evaluated for feasibility and usability while clinicians deliver care to continuously monitored patients enrolled in the study. RESULTS: Our target CDI will be a binary classifier trained to distinguish participants with and those without decompensation. The primary performance metric for CDI will be the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve with a minimum performance criterion of ≥0.75 (α=.05; power [1-β]=0.80). Furthermore, we will determine the sex or gender and race or ethnicity of the participants, which would account for differences in the CDI performance, as well as the lead time-time to predict decompensation-and its relationship with the ultimate disease severity based on the World Health Organization COVID-19 ordinal scale. CONCLUSIONS: Using machine learning techniques on a large data set of patients with COVID-19 could provide valuable insights into the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and a digital biomarker for COVID-19 decompensation. Through this study, we intend to develop a tool that can uniquely reflect physiological data of a diverse population and contribute to high-quality data that will help researchers better understand COVID-19.

However, it is still a critical challenge to simultaneously achieve high sensitivity, low detection limit, fast response, and outstanding breathability for wearable electronics due to the difficulty in constructing microstructure on a porous substrate. Inspired by the spinosum microstructure of human skin for highly-sensitive tactile perception, a biomimetic flexible pressure sensor is designed and fabricated by assembling MXene-based sensing electrode and MXene-based interdigitated electrode. The product biomimetic sensor exhibits good flexibility and suitable air permeability (165.6 mm s(-1)), comparable to the typical air permeable garments. Benefiting from the two-stage amplification effect of the bionic intermittent structure, the product bionic sensor exhibits an ultrahigh sensitivity (1368.9 kPa(-1)), ultrafast response (20 ms), low detection limit (1 Pa), and high-linearity response (R(2) = 0.997) across the entire sensing range. Moreover, the pressure sensor can detect a wide range of human motion in real-time through intimate skin contact, providing essential data for biomedical monitoring and personal medical diagnosis. This principle lays a foundation for the development of human skin-like high-sensitivity, fast-response tactile sensors."

Usability, in telecare monitoring systems, determines how much the system is effective and efficient for the telecare users. Usability has been considered an important factor in the acceptance of telecare monitoring systems by individuals who encounter challenges in the use of such systems and who possess a limited knowledge of their use.Objectives: The purpose of this study is to explore the relevant usability issues and identify possible solutions to improve the usability of telecare monitoring systems.Method: The study is based on eight research questions and to find the answers to those research questions, a systematic literature is performed.Results: The research findings highlight various usability issues, including the complexity of the interface, difficulty in reading the text, and insufficient provision of instructions. These studies have also suggested solutions to enhance the usability of systems, including development of the technical skills of users, explanations of usability evaluation techniques for telecare monitoring systems, and engaging the appropriate users during the development of telecare monitoring systems.Implications for rehabilitationSuccessful implementation of telecare monitoring systems can increase the chances of acceptance of telecare monitoring systems by the users.Implementing an efficient and effective system will make telecare users more independent at their homes.The development of usable telecare monitoring systems can significantly contribute to a basis for clinical and home-based implementation of the telehealth technology to promote remote monitoring for elderly and people with disabilities.Considering the usability issues and solutions identified in this study, it will go a long way towards aiding subsequent researchers and developers in the implementation of more usable and valid telecare monitoring systems."

Liquid metal (LM) has been recognized as an ideal electrode material to fabricate E-skins. However, conventional sealed LM electrodes cannot expose the LM layer for direct contact with the skin resulting in the low performance of electrophysiological monitoring. Furthermore, traditional printed LM electrodes are difficult to transfer or recycle, and fractures easily occur under stretching of the substrate. Here, we report a kind of LM electrode that we call a kirigami-structured LM paper (KLP), which is self-supporting, conductor-exposing, stretchable, ultrathin, and recyclable for multifunctional E-skin. The KLP is fabricated by the kirigami paper cutting art with three types of structures including uniaxial, biaxial, and square spiral. The KLP can act as an E-skin to acquire high-quality electrophysiological signals, such as electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG), and electromyogram (EMG). Upon integration with a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), the KLP can also operate as a self-powered E-skin. On the basis of the self-powered E-skin, we further developed a smart dialing communication system, which is applied on human skin to call a cellphone. Compared with conventional sealed or printed LM electrodes, the KLP can simultaneously achieve self-supporting, conductor-exposing, stretchable, ultrathin, and recyclable features. Such KLP offers potential for E-skins in healthcare monitoring and intelligent control, as well as smart robots, virtual reality, on-skin personal electronics, etc."

Thus, tools that can provide early detection of deterioration may be lifesaving. Frequent remote patient monitoring (RPM) has the potential to allow such early detection, leading to a timely intervention by health care providers. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the potential of a novel wearable RPM device to provide timely alerts in patients at high risk for deterioration. METHODS: This prospective observational study was conducted in two general wards of a large tertiary medical center. Patients determined to be at high risk to deteriorate upon admission and assigned to a telemetry bed were included. On top of the standard monitoring equipment, a wearable monitor was attached to each patient, and monitoring was conducted in parallel. The data gathered by the wearable monitors were analyzed retrospectively, with the medical staff being blinded to them in real time. Several early warning scores of the risk for deterioration were used, all calculated from frequent data collected by the wearable RPM device: these included (1) the National Early Warning Score (NEWS), (2) Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Neurology, and Other (ABCNO) score, and (3) deterioration criteria defined by the clinical team as a ""wish list"" score. In all three systems, the risk scores were calculated every 5 minutes using the data frequently collected by the wearable RPM device. Data generated by the early warning scores were compared with those obtained from the clinical records of actual deterioration among these patients. RESULTS: In total, 410 patients were recruited and 217 were included in the final analysis. The median age was 71 (IQR 62-78) years and 130 (59.9%) of them were male. Actual clinical deterioration occurred in 24 patients. The NEWS indicated high alert in 16 of these 24 (67%) patients, preceding actual clinical deterioration by 29 hours on average. The ABCNO score indicated high alert in 18 (75%) of these patients, preceding actual clinical deterioration by 38 hours on average. Early warning based on wish list scoring criteria was observed for all 24 patients 40 hours on average before clinical deterioration was detected by the medical staff. Importantly, early warning based on the wish list scoring criteria was also observed among all other patients who did not deteriorate. CONCLUSIONS: Frequent remote patient monitoring has the potential for early detection of a high risk to deteriorate among hospitalized patients, using both grouped signal-based scores and algorithm-based prediction. In this study, we show the ability to formulate scores for early warning by using RPM. Nevertheless, early warning scores compiled on the basis of these data failed to deliver reasonable specificity. Further efforts should be directed at improving the specificity and sensitivity of such tools. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04220359; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04220359."

Access to evidence-based migraine care is limited and projected to worsen. Novel mobile health app-based tools may effectively deliver migraine patient education to support self-management, facilitate remote monitoring and treatment, and improve access to care. The risk that such an intervention may increase the care team workload is a potential implementation barrier. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe a novel electronic health record-integrated mobile app-based Migraine Interactive Care Plan (MICP) and evaluate its feasibility, usability, and impact on care teams in a community neurology practice. METHODS: Consecutive enrollees between September 1, 2020, and February 16, 2022, were assessed in a single-arm observational study of usability, defined by 74.3% (127/171) completing ≥1 assigned task. Task response rates, rate and type of care team escalations, and patient-reported outcomes were summarized. Patients were prospectively recruited and randomly assigned to routine care with or without the MICP from September 1, 2020, to September 1, 2021. Feasibility was defined by equal to or fewer downstream face-to-face visits, telephone contacts, and electronic messages in the MICP cohort. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare continuous variables, and the chi-square test was used for categorical variables for those with at least 3 months of follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 171 patients were enrolled, and of these, 127 (74.3%) patients completed ≥1 MICP-assigned task. Mean escalations per patient per month was 0.9 (SD 0.37; range 0-1.7). Patient-confirmed understanding of the educational materials ranged from 26.6% (45/169) to 56.2% (95/169). Initial mean headache days per week was 4.54 (SD 2.06) days and declined to 2.86 (SD 1.87) days at week 26. The percentage of patients reporting favorable satisfaction increased from a baseline of 35% (20/57) to 83% (15/18; response rate of 42/136, 30.9% to 28/68, 41%) over the first 6 months. A total of 121 patients with MICP were compared with 62 patients in the control group. No differences were observed in the rate of telephone contacts or electronic messages. Fewer face-to-face visits were observed in the MICP cohort (13/121, 10.7%) compared with controls (26/62, 42%; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: We describe the successful implementation of an electronic health record-integrated mobile app-based care plan for migraine in a community neurology practice. We observed fewer downstream face-to-face visits without increasing telephone calls, medication refills, or electronic messages. Our findings suggest that the MICP has the potential to improve patient access without increasing care team workload and the need for patient input from diverse populations to improve and sustain patient engagement. Additional studies are needed to assess its impact in primary care."

These problems include the risk of relapse, side effects, and long-term complications. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to design and develop a remote monitoring system as a technological solution for the postdischarge care of these patients. METHODS: This research was conducted in 3 main steps: system feature extraction, system design, and evaluation. After feature extraction from a systematic review, the necessary features were defined by 18 clinical experts in Iran. In the next step, the architecture of the system was designed based on the requirements; the software and hardware parts of the system were embedded in the architecture, then the software system components were drawn using the unified modeling language diagrams, and the details of software system implementation were identified. Regarding the hardware design, different accessible hardware modules were evaluated, and suitable ones were selected. Finally, the usability of the system was evaluated by demonstrating it over a Skype virtual meeting session and using Nilsen's usability principles. RESULTS: A total of 21 mandatory features in 5 main categories, including patient information registration, periodic monitoring of health parameters, education, reminders, and assessments, were defined and validated for the system. The software was developed using an ASP.Net core backend, a Microsoft SQL Server database, and an Ionic frontend alongside the Angular framework, to build an Android app. The user roles of the system included 3 roles: physicians, patients, and the system administrator. The hardware was designed to contain an Esp8266 as the Internet of Things module, an MLX90614 infrared temperature sensor, and the Maxim Integrated MAX30101 sensor for sensing the heartbeat. The hardware was designed in the shape of a wristband device using SolidWorks 2020 and printed using a 3D printer. The firmware of the hardware was developed in Arduino with the capability of firmware over the air. In evaluating the software system from the perspective of usability, the system received an average score of 3.8 out of 5 from 4 evaluators. CONCLUSIONS: Sensor-based telemonitoring systems for patients with colorectal cancer after surgery are possible solutions that can make the process automatic for patients and caregivers. The apps for remote colorectal patient monitoring could be designed to be useful; however, more research regarding the developed system's implementation in clinic settings and hospitals is required to understand the probable barriers and limitations."

In-hospital remote automated monitoring (RAM) and virtual hospital-to-home patient care systems have major potential to improve patient outcomes following cardiac and major vascular surgery. However, the science of deploying and evaluating these systems is complex and subject to risk of implementation failure. OBJECTIVE: As a precursor to a randomized controlled trial (RCT), this user testing study aimed to examine user performance and acceptance of a RAM and virtual hospital-to-home care intervention, using Philip's Guardian and Electronic Transition to Ambulatory Care (eTrAC) technologies, respectively. METHODS: Nurses and patients participated in systems training and individual case-based user testing at two participating sites in Canada and the United Kingdom. Participants were video recorded and asked to think aloud while completing required user tasks and while being rated on user performance. Feedback was also solicited about the user experience, including user satisfaction and acceptance, through use of the Net Promoter Scale (NPS) survey and debrief interviews. RESULTS: A total of 37 participants (26 nurses and 11 patients) completed user testing. The majority of nurse and patient participants were able to complete most required tasks independently, demonstrating comprehension and retention of required Guardian and eTrAC system workflows. Tasks which required additional prompting by the facilitator, for some, were related to the use of system features that enable continuous transmission of patient vital signs (eg, pairing wireless sensors to the patient) and assigning remote patient monitoring protocols. NPS scores by user group (nurses using Guardian: mean 8.8, SD 0.89; nurses using eTrAC: mean 7.7, SD 1.4; patients using eTrAC: mean 9.2, SD 0.75), overall NPS scores, and participant debrief interviews indicated nurse and patient satisfaction and acceptance of the Guardian and eTrAC systems. Both user groups stressed the need for additional opportunities to practice in order to become comfortable and proficient in the use of these systems. CONCLUSIONS: User testing indicated a high degree of user acceptance of Philips' Guardian and eTrAC systems among nurses and patients. Key insights were provided that informed refinement of clinical workflow training and systems implementation. These results were used to optimize workflows before the launch of an international RCT of in-hospital RAM and virtual hospital-to-home care for patients undergoing cardiac and major vascular surgery."

Furthermore, they may frequently need to visit the emergency department or be hospitalized due to their condition deteriorating. Home telemonitoring can play a role in tracking symptoms, reducing hospital visits, and improving quality of life. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to conduct a feasibility study of a home health monitoring (HHM) solution for patients with HF in British Columbia, Canada, to prepare for conducting a randomized controlled trial. METHODS: Patients with HF were recruited from 3 urban hospitals and provided with HHM technology for 60 days of monitoring postdischarge. Participants were asked to monitor their weight, blood pressure, and heart rate and to answer symptomology questions via Bluetooth sensors and a tablet computer each day. A monitoring nurse received this data and monitored the patient's condition. In our evaluation, the primary outcome was the combination of unscheduled emergency department revisits of discharged participants or death within 90 days. Secondary outcomes included 90-day hospital readmissions, patient quality of life (as measured by Veterans Rand 12-Item Health Survey and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Scale), self-efficacy (as measured by European Heart Failure Self-Care Behaviour Scale 9), end-user experience, and health system cost-effectiveness including cost reduction and hospital bed capacity. In this feasibility study, we also tested the recruitment strategy, clinical protocols, evaluation framework, and data collection methods. RESULTS: Seventy participants were enrolled into this trial. Participant engagement to monitoring was measured at 94% (N=70; ie, data submitted 56/60 days on average). Our evaluation framework allowed us to collect sound data, which also showed encouraging trends: a 79% reduction of emergency department revisits post monitoring, an 87% reduction in hospital readmissions, and a 60% reduction in the median hospital length of stay (n=36). Cost of hospitalization for participants decreased by 71%, and emergency department visit costs decreased by 58% (n=30). Overall health system costs for our participants showed a 56% reduction post monitoring (n=30). HF-specific quality of life (Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Scale) scores showed a significant increase of 101% (n=35) post monitoring (P<.001). General quality of life (Veterans Rand 12-Item Health Survey) improved by 19% (n=35) on the mental component score (P<.001) and 19% (n=35) on the physical component score (P=.02). Self-efficacy improved by 6% (n=35). Interviews with participants revealed that they were satisfied overall with the monitoring program and its usability, and participants reported being more engaged, educated, and involved in their self-management. CONCLUSIONS: Results from this small-sample feasibility study suggested that our HHM intervention can be beneficial in supporting patients post discharge. Additionally, key insights from the trial allowed us to refine our methods and procedures, such as shifting our recruitment methods to in-patient wards and increasing our scope of data collection. Although these findings are promising, a more rigorous trial design is required to test the true efficacy of the intervention. The results from this feasibility trial will inform our next step as we proceed with a randomized controlled trial across British Columbia.

But when patients use medical devices in their homes, the technologies have to fit into their lives. We investigated the technology acceptance of seven digital devices for home use. METHODS: We conducted 60 semi-structured interviews with participants of a larger device study on their views on the acceptability of seven devices. Transcriptions were analysed using qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology, we evaluated effort, facilitating conditions, performance expectancy and social influence of each device.In the effort category, five themes emerged: (a) the hassle to use the device; (b) its usability; (c) comfort; (d) disturbance to daily life; and (e) problems during usage. Facilitating conditions consisted of five themes: (a) expectations regarding a device; (b) quality of the instructions; (c) insecurities with usage; (d) possibilities of optimization; and (e) possibilities to use the device longer. Regarding performance expectancy, we identified three themes: (a) insecurities with the performance of a device; (b) feedback; and (c) motivation for using a device. In the social influence category, three themes emerged: (a) reactions of peers; (b) concerns with the visibility of a device; and (c) concerns regarding data privacy. CONCLUSIONS: We identify key factors that determine the acceptability of medical devices for home use from the participants' perspective. These include low effort of use, minor disruptions to their daily lives and good support from the study team."

A virtual trial design was adopted to reduce risks to participants and the research community in a study titled Risk Stratification and Early Alerting Regarding COVID-19 Hospitalization (RiskSEARCH). The Food and Drug Administration-cleared Current Health platform with a wearable device is a continuous remote patient monitoring technology that supports hospital-at-home care and is used as a data collection tool. Enrolled participants wore the Current Health wearable device continuously for up to 30 days and took a daily symptom survey via a tablet that was provided. A qualitative substudy was conducted in parallel to better understand virtual trial implementation, including barriers and facilitators for participants. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to understand the barriers and facilitators of the user experience of interacting with a virtual care platform and research team, while participating in a fully virtual study using qualitative and quantitative data. METHODS: Semistructured interviews were conducted to understand participants' experience of participating in a virtual study during a global pandemic. The schedule included their experience of enrollment and their interactions with equipment and study staff. A total of 3 RiskSEARCH participants were interviewed over telephone, and transcriptions were inductively coded and analyzed using thematic analysis. Themes were mapped onto the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) to identify and describe the factors that influenced study adherence. Quantitative metrics, including adherence to wearable and scheduled tasks collected as part of the RiskSEARCH main study, were paired with the interviews to present an overall picture of participation. RESULTS: All participants exceeded our definition of a fully adherent participant and reported that participation was feasible and had a low burden. The symptoms progressively resolved during the trial. Inductive thematic analysis identified 13 main themes from the interview data, which were deductively mapped onto 11 of the 14 TDF domains, highlighting barriers and facilitators for each. CONCLUSIONS: Participants in the RiskSEARCH substudy showed high levels of adherence and engagement throughout participation. Although participants experienced some challenges in setting up and maintaining the Current Health kit (eg, charging devices), they reported feeling that the requirements of participation were both reasonable and realistic. We demonstrated that the TDF can be used for inductive thematic analysis. We anticipate expanding this work in future virtual studies and trials to identify barriers and enabling factors for implementation."

However, RPM is a complex, multilevel intervention with technology, workflow, contextual and patient experience components. The purpose of this pilot study is to determine the feasibility of RPM protocol implementation with respect to decentralised recruitment, patient retention, adherence to reporting recommendations, RPM platform usability and patient experience in ambulatory cancer patients at high risk for chemotherapy-related symptoms. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This protocol describes a single-arm decentralised feasibility pilot study of technology-enhanced outpatient symptom management system in patients with gastrointestinal and thoracic cancer receiving chemotherapy and cancer care at a single site (MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston Texas). An anticipated total of 25 patients will be recruited prior to the initiation of chemotherapy and provided with a set of validated questionnaires at enrollment and after our 1-month feasibility pilot trial period. Our intervention entails the self-reporting of symptoms and vital signs via a HIPAA-compliant, secure tablet interface that also enables (1) the provision of self-care materials to patients, (2) generation of threshold alerts to a dedicated call-centre and (3) videoconferencing. Vital sign information (heart rate, blood pressure, pulse, oxygen saturation, weight and temperature) will be captured via Bluetooth-enabled biometric monitoring devices which are integrated with the tablet interface. Protocolised triage and management of symptoms will occur in response to the alerts. Feasibility and acceptability metrics will characterise our recruitment process, protocol adherence, patient retention and usability of the RPM platform. We will also document the perceived effectiveness of our intervention by patients. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has been granted approval by the institutional review board of MD Anderson Cancer Center. We anticipate dissemination of our pilot and subsequent effectiveness trial results via presentations at national conferences and peer-reviewed publications in the relevant medical journals. Our results will also be made available to cancer survivors, their caregivers and hospital administration. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCI202107464."

South Korea introduced living and treatment support centers (LTSCs) to control regional outbreaks and care for patients with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19. Seoul National University Hospital (SNUH) introduced information and communications technology (ICT)-based solutions to manage clinically healthy patients with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate satisfaction and usability by patients and health professionals in the optimal use of a mobile app and wearable device that SNUH introduced to the LTSC for clinically healthy patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Online surveys and focus group interviews were conducted to collect quantitative and qualitative data. RESULTS: Regarding usability testing of the wearable device, perceived usefulness had the highest mean score of 4.45 (SD 0.57) points out of 5. Regarding usability of the mobile app, perceived usefulness had the highest mean score of 4.62 (SD 0.48) points out of 5. Regarding satisfaction items for the mobile app among medical professionals, the ""self-reporting"" item had the highest mean score of 4.42 (SD 0.58) points out of 5. In focus group interviews of health care professionals, hospital information system interfacing was the most important functional requirement for ICT-based COVID-19 telemedicine. CONCLUSIONS: Improvement of patient safety and reduction of the burden on medical staff were the expected positive outcomes. Stability and reliability of the device, patient education, accountability, and reimbursement issues should be considered as part of the development of remote patient monitoring. In responding to a novel contagious disease, telemedicine and a wearable device were shown to be useful during a global crisis."

Postoperative rehabilitation is critical, requiring patients to complete home exercise programs (HEPs). To address obstacles to HEP adherence, we developed an interactive health technology, interACTION (iA), to monitor knee-specific rehabilitation. iA is a web-based platform that incorporates wearable motion sensors and a mobile app that provides feedback and allows remote monitoring. The Wheel of Sukr is a gamification mechanism that includes numerous behavioral elements. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to use a user-centered design process to incorporate behavioral change strategies derived from self-management theory into iA using the Wheel of Sukr, with the aim of influencing patient behavior. METHODS: In total, 10 athletes aged 10-18 years with a history of ACL-R were included in this study. Patients were between 4 weeks and 1 year post-ACL-R. Participants underwent a 60-minute triphasic interview. Phase 1 focused on elements of gaming that led to high participation and information regarding surgery and recovery. In phase 2, participants were asked to think aloud and rank cards representing the components of the Wheel of Sukr in order of interest. In phase 3, the patients reviewed the current version of iA. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and checked for accuracy. Qualitative content analysis segmented the data and tagged meaningful codes until descriptive redundancy was achieved; next, 2 coders independently coded the data set. These elements were categorized according to the Wheel of Sukr framework. The mean age of participants was 12.8 (SD 1.32) years, and 70% (7/10) were female. Most participants (7/10, 70%) reported attending sessions twice weekly. All patients were prescribed home exercises. Self-reported HEP compliance was 75%-100% in 40% (4/10), 50%-75% in 40% (4/10), and 25%-50% of prescribed exercises in 20% (2/10) of the participants. RESULTS: The participants responded positively to an app that could track home exercises. Desirable features included exercise demonstrations, motivational components, and convenience. The participants listed sports specificity, competition, notifications, reminders, rewards, and social aspects of gameplay as features to incorporate. In the Wheel of Sukr card sort exercise, motivation was ranked first; self-management, second; and growth, esteem, and fun tied for the third position. The recommended gameplay components closely followed the themes from the Wheel of Sukr card sort activity. CONCLUSIONS: The participants believe iA is a helpful addition to recovery and want the app to include exercise movement tracking and encouragement. Despite the small number of participants, thematic saturation was reached, suggesting the sample was sufficient to obtain a representative range of perspectives. Future work will implement motivation; self-management; and growth, confidence, and fun in the iA user experience. Young athlete ACL-R patients will complete typical clinical scenarios using increasingly developed prototypes of the gamified iA in a controlled setting."

Although remote electrocardiogram (ECG) solutions are emerging rapidly, existing technology is neither designed nor validated for continuous use during vigorous exercise. OBJECTIVE: In this proof-of-concept study, we evaluated the usability, signal quality, and accuracy for arrhythmia detection of a single-lead ECG patch platform featuring self-adhesive dry electrode technology in individuals with chronic coronary syndrome. This sensor was evaluated during exercise and for prolonged, continuous monitoring. METHODS: We recruited a total of 6 consecutive patients with chronic coronary syndrome scheduled for an exercise stress test (EST) as part of routine cardiac follow-up. Traditional 12-lead ECG recording was combined with monitoring with the ECG patch. Following the EST, the participants continuously wore the sensor for 5 days. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and Wilcoxon signed rank tests were used to assess the utility of detecting arrhythmias with the patch by comparing the evaluations of 2 blinded assessors. Signal quality during EST and prolonged monitoring was evaluated by using a signal quality indicator. Additionally, connection time was calculated for prolonged ECG monitoring. The comfort and usability of the patch were evaluated by a web-based self-assessment questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 6 male patients with chronic coronary syndrome (mean age 69.8, SD 6.2 years) completed the study protocol. The patch was worn for a mean of 118.3 (SD 5.6) hours. The level of agreement between the patch and 12-lead ECG was excellent for the detection of premature atrial contractions and premature ventricular contractions during the whole test (ICC=0.998, ICC=1.000). No significant differences in the total number of premature atrial contractions and premature ventricular contractions were detected neither during the entire exercise test (P=.79 and P=.18, respectively) nor during the exercise and recovery stages separately (P=.41, P=.66, P=.18, and P=.66). A total of 1 episode of atrial fibrillation was detected by both methods. Total connection time during recording was between 88% and 100% for all participants. There were no reports of skin irritation, erythema, or pain while wearing the patch. CONCLUSIONS: This proof-of-concept study showed that this innovative ECG patch based on self-adhesive dry electrode technology can potentially be used for arrhythmia detection during vigorous exercise. The results suggest that the wearable patch is also usable for prolonged continuous ECG monitoring in free-living conditions and can therefore be of potential use in cardiac rehabilitation and tele-monitoring for the prevention of exercise-related cardiovascular events. Future efforts will focus on optimizing signal quality over time and conducting a larger-scale validation study focusing on both arrhythmia and ischemia detection."

However, traditional physiological signal monitoring confined by the specific clinical sites and unreliability of the epidermal electrodes leads to great restrictions on its application. Herein, we constructed a solution-processed submicron (down to 230 nm), free-standing, breathable sandwich-structured hybrid electrode composed of a silver nanowire network with a conductive polymer film, which is conformal, water-permeable, and noninvasive to the skin while achieving good signal acquisition ability. The free-standing hybrid electrode is prepared via an in situ capillary force lift-off process and can be transferred onto complex surfaces. The whole process is a complete solution process that facilitates large-area preparation and application. The light-weight hybrid electrodes exhibit high optical transmittance, high electrical conductivity, and high gas/ion permeability. When the hybrid electrodes are attached onto the skin, the imperceptible films show high conformality with low electrical impedance, thus exhibiting significantly improved electrocardiology and electromyogram signal monitoring performance compared to that of the commercial gel electrodes."

OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the potential of supporting mobile nursing organizations in rural regions with the use of mobile telemonitoring systems in a case study setting. METHODS: As a subproject of the European Union-funded project INTESI, the VITAl parameter MOnitoring (VITAMO) project gathered stakeholders' requirements for telemonitoring support of mobile care in rural regions and then developed and implemented a prototype system that was used for a 3-month test period with a local nursing organization in Austria. Log analysis, surveys, and interviews were used to evaluate the system according to the Technology Acceptance Model. The focus was technology assessment and user satisfaction of both patients and nurses. RESULTS: Participants were provided Bluetooth devices to measure blood pressure, body weight, and blood glucose and to track activity. They also received a tablet with a mobile internet connection to see the results. The nurses were able to access the results remotely. Regularly executed speed tests and log analysis demonstrated the availability of high-speed mobile internet in the rural test region. Log analysis, surveys, and interviews revealed the suitability of the technology environment and showed that the system was easy to use and potentially useful. The perceived usefulness for supporting mobile care was rated meaningfully low, and the frequency of nurses using the tool declined continuously over the field test period. Further group discussions investigated this issue. CONCLUSIONS: While the technology environment with mobile internet, Bluetooth devices, and smart vital sign monitoring devices was adequate and suitable to support mobile nursing in rural regions, the potential benefit for the nursing organization could not be confirmed. Further analysis revealed that operational care processes did not follow a well-defined care strategy. Technology has the potential to leverage the available environment for developing meaningful solutions. These experiences could contribute to further investigations that need to identify and analyze existing mobile care processes at an organizational level."

It has negative consequences on health status, causing psychological distress and affecting quality of life. Furthermore, the clinical management of chronic pain is often inadequate, and many patients do not benefit from the administration of pharmacological treatments. Alternative therapeutic options have been implemented to improve the psychophysical well-being of patients, including neuromodulation and complementary interventions. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a home care strategy combining computerized rehabilitation, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and remote telemonitoring via a web-based platform in patients with breast cancer suffering for chronic pain. METHODS: A web-based structured survey aimed at monitoring chronic pain and its effect on psychological functions will be delivered to patients with breast cancer through social media and email. In total, 42 patients with breast cancer affected by chronic pain will be recruited during the medical screening visit. The patients will be randomly divided into 3 treatment groups that will carry out either tDCS only, exercise therapy only, or a combination of both over a 3-week period. All the treatments will be delivered at the patients' home through the use of a system including a tablet, wearable inertial sensors, and a tDCS programmable medical device. Using web-based questionnaires, the perception of pain (based on the pain self-efficacy questionnaire, visual analogue scale, pain catastrophizing scale, and brief pain inventory) and psychological variables (based on the hospital and anxiety depression scale and 12-item short form survey) will be assessed at the beginning of treatment, 1 week after the start of treatment, at the end of treatment, 1 month after the start of treatment, and 3 months after the start of treatment. The system's usability (based on the mobile app rating scale and system usability scale) and its involvement in the decision-making process (based on the 9-item shared decision-making questionnaire) will be also evaluated. Finally, at the end of the treatment, a digital focus group will be conducted with the 42 patients to explore their unexpressed needs and preferences concerning treatment. RESULTS: The study project is scheduled to start in June 2023, and it is expected to be completed by August 2025. CONCLUSIONS: We expect that the combination of tDCS and telemedicine programs will reduce pain perceived by patients with breast cancer and improve their mental well-being more effectively than single interventions. Furthermore, we assume that this home-based approach will also improve patients' participation in routine clinical care, reducing disparities in accessing health care processes. This integrated home care strategy could be useful for patients with breast cancer who cannot find relief from chronic pain with pharmacological treatments or for those who have limited access to care due to poor mobility or geographical barriers, thus increasing the patients' empowerment and reducing health care costs.

We propose an innovative solution to the detection of early signs of frailty by presenting a serious game controlled by a smart sensorized soft plastic ball, designed to achieve continuous home-based monitoring of muscle weakness in older adults. Design, development, and testing of the smart ball and of the game interface devised to guide the monitoring procedure are presented. Reliability and concurrent validity of the system in measuring maximal grip strength against the clinical standard Jamar(®) were evaluated. Serious game usability and acceptance were investigated on 26 elderlies. Smart ball and Jamar measurements were well correlated (0.76 and 0.80 for dominant and non-dominant hands) and test-retest reliability of pressure measurements was excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient >0.94). The serious game was well accepted by the 96.1 percent of participants, who provided a strongly positive usability score (87.7/100). The smart ball-driven serious game demonstrated excellent reliability and good validity in measuring grip strength. The proposed smart ball-driven serious game can be used for home self-monitoring of grip strength in elderlies."

In this scenario, telemedicine and e-health solutions, including remote monitoring and rehabilitation, are attracting increasing interest as tools to ensure the sustainability of the healthcare system or, at least, to support the burden for health care facilities. Technological advances in recent decades have fostered the development of dedicated and innovative Information and Communication Technology (ICT) based solutions, with the aim of complementing traditional care and treatment services through telemedicine applications that support new patient and disease management strategies. This is the background for the REHOME project, whose technological solution, presented in this paper, integrates innovative methodologies and devices for remote monitoring and rehabilitation of cognitive, motor, and sleep disorders associated with neurological diseases. One of the primary goals of the project is to meet the needs of patients and clinicians, by ensuring continuity of treatment from healthcare facilities to the patient's home. To this end, it is important to ensure the usability of the solution by elderly and pathological individuals. Preliminary results of usability and user experience questionnaires on 70 subjects recruited in three experimental trials are presented here."

The aim of this study is to investigate the safety and accuracy of the new Cordella(TM) Pulmonary Artery Pressure Sensor (Endotronix, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and the usability of the comprehensive Cordella(TM) Heart Failure System (CHFS). METHODS AND RESULTS: Multicentre, open-label, first-in-human, feasibility study to evaluate the CHFS and the safety and accuracy of the Cordella™ Pulmonary Artery Pressure Sensor in 15 patients with New York Heart Association class III HF. All patients were successfully implanted with the Cordella Pulmonary Artery Pressure Sensor, without sensor failure. No device system-related complications, defined as invasive treatment, device explant or death, occurred. The primary efficacy endpoint of a mean pulmonary artery pressure at 90 days was met in all but one patients with a cohort difference of 2.7 mmHg (Cordella Sensor 22.5 ± 11.8 mmHg, Swan-Ganz catheter 25.2 ± 8.5 mmHg). One patient did not go through the 90-day right heart catheterization for safety reasons. Patient adherence to daily measurement, transmission of vital signs and pulmonary artery pressure sensor readings were recorded 99% of the time. CONCLUSION: The initial experience of the CHFS incorporating comprehensive vital signs and pulmonary artery pressure monitoring enables safe and accurate monitoring of HF status."

However, monitoring these parameters in this setting and in these patients using noninvasive, wireless devices has not been conducted so far. We aimed to assess the use of a novel noninvasive continuous monitoring device in STEMI patients admitted to the ICCU. METHODS: Participants included STEMI patients that were admitted to the ICCU after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI). Patients were continuously monitored using a novel wearable chest patch monitor. RESULTS: Fifteen patients with STEMI who underwent PPCI were included in this study. The median age was 52.8 years, the majority were males, and the median body mass index (BMI) was 25.7. Monitoring lasted for 66  ±  16 hours, and included the automatic collection and recording of all vitals, freeing the nursing staff to focus on other tasks. The user experience of nurses as reflected in filled questionnaires showed high satisfaction rates in all aspects. CONCLUSION: A novel noninvasive, wireless device showed high feasibility in continuously monitoring multiple crucial parameters in STEMI patients admitted to the ICCU after PPCI."

Digital health technologies have great potential for unobtrusively monitoring brushing behaviors in home settings and promoting optimal oral self-care routines at scale. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to leverage the ubiquity of electronic toothbrushes and smartphones with the development of a Remote Oral Behaviors Assessment System (ROBAS) and evaluate its feasibility for passively tracking brushing behaviors in real-world settings. METHODS: We developed ROBAS by linking inertial sensors contained within consumer electronic toothbrushes to a scalable software platform comprised of a smartphone app linked to a cloud platform. First, the criterion validity of ROBAS for accurately capturing brushing details was established in a laboratory setting. Next, real-world performance and usability were evaluated in a stratified community sample of 32 participants who used ROBAS daily for 1 month and maintained a diary of their brushing episodes. Semistructured interviews at baseline and exit captured the user experience. We used regression models and Bland-Altman analyses to assess the criterion validity, functionality, accuracy, and consistency of ROBAS. RESULTS: Using a stopwatch as the criterion reference, ROBAS showed a mean absolute percent error (MAPE) of 1.8%, an estimated bias of 0.64 seconds that was not statistically distinguishable from zero (95% CI -0.93 to 2.22 seconds, SE 0.79), and a connection failure rate of 6.7% (95% CI 0.8%-22.1%, SE 4.6%). In real-world testing, ROBAS showed close agreement with the daily diary recordings of brushing episodes; estimated average discrepancies between the diary and ROBAS were 0.13 sessions per day (95% CI 0.01-0.26, SE 0.06), 8.0 seconds per brushing session (95% CI 1.4-14.7, SE 3.3), and 30 seconds of brushing per day (95% CI 9.3-50.1, SE 10.0). Retrospective self-reports produced substantially higher estimates of brushing frequency and duration compared to ROBAS measurements. Participants reported ROBAS was easy to use and expressed an interest in receiving ROBAS-delivered feedback on their brushing behaviors. Most participants were bothered by the use of an additional study phone, and some reported connectivity-related issues. CONCLUSIONS: ROBAS has a high criterion validity for measuring oral health behaviors. It can accurately and reliably monitor brushing patterns in home settings for extended periods. Unobtrusive data collection through ROBAS sets the stage for automated coaching and optimization of oral self-care practices at the individual and population level."

Connected medical devices monitoring vital signs, associated with eHealth program and structured telephone support, may improve complex patient management through early detection of disease complications, positive impact on patients' health, and health resources consumption optimization. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the technical performance and user experience of the NOMHAD eHealth system in patients with multimorbidity. METHODS: This was a pilot, single-arm, interventional study. Patients with multimorbidity with any combination of chronic heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes were followed for 80-100 days using the NOMHAD eHealth system. This system used connected devices telemonitoring symptoms and vital signs (eg, body weight, oxygen saturation, pulse rate, blood pressure, and blood glucose), associated with structured telecoaching and educational support by call center nurses. An overall risk indicator (ORI) was automatically computed after each data teletransmission. The ORI was color coded; green indicated no action required; yellow, orange, and red (low to high priority, respectively) generated telenotifications and indicated to the nurses the need for a telecoaching action. Each ORI was calculated by combining 7 clinical stability system indicators based on symptom questionnaires and vital signs. Technical accuracy of the system was assessed by comparing system-generated ORIs with ORIs recalculated from raw data. Ease of use, usefulness, satisfaction, and acceptability of the system were assessed through patient adherence to self-assessments, and through self-administered questionnaires to patients, call center nurses, and physicians. RESULTS: A total of 23 patients were enrolled in this study and participated between April 2016 and March 2017 at 5 study centers in France. All patients were successfully equipped and evaluable for analysis. Mean age was 68.5 (SD 10.4) years and most patients were men (n=20). The most common multimorbidity was CHF + diabetes (n=15), followed by patients with all 3 diseases (n=5). Mean effective follow-up was 78.7 (SD 24.2) days. The system generated 6263 ORIs, as several ORIs could be generated on a single day for any patient. Overall system sensitivity was 99.2% (95% CI 98.9-99.4) and overall specificity was 91.3% (95% CI 87.7-94.1). Most patients (20/23, 87%) were satisfied with the system and agreed that it helped them to better understand and manage their diseases, and 19/23 (83%) valued the nurse regular contacts. Nurses and physicians were generally satisfied with the system and considered it useful. All users indicated they would agree to long-term use of the system. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that the NOMHAD eHealth system is accurate, acceptable, informative, and feasible for patients with multimorbidity, supporting further investigation of its clinical benefits.

In this case, the study examined the potential of remote monitoring of gait to address the sensitivity of multiple sclerosis progression to gait characteristics by adopting a non-invasive approach to remotely quantify gait disturbances in a patient's daily life. To better understand the managerial aspects associated with this approach, the researchers conducted a literature review along with a set of semi-structured interviews. The target population included MS patients as well as the key agents involved in their care: patients' family members, neurologists, MS nurses, physiotherapists, medical directors, and pharmacist. The study identifies the perceived barriers and drivers that could contribute to the successful deployment of PSS remote gait monitoring as a healthcare service: i) At mega-level governance. Implications on privacy and security data are notable barriers missing on the speech. ii) At macro level, funding is highlighted as main barrier. The cost and lack of health system subsidies may render initiatives unsustainable, as emphasised by the interviewees. iii) At meso level, useable data is recognised as a driver. The data collection process can align with diverse interests to create value and business opportunities for the ecosystem actors, enhance care, attract stakeholders, such as insurers and pharma, and form partnerships. iv) At micro-level processes, we find two potential barriers: wearable device and app usability (comfort, navigation, efficiency) and organisational/behavioural aspects (training, digital affinity, skills), which are crucial for value creation in innovation ecosystems among patients and healthcare professionals. Finally, we find an interesting gap in the literature and interviews. Stakeholders' limited awareness of technological demands, especially from information technologies, for a successful long-term service, can be consider two key barriers for PSS."

To address the gap, a wireless handheld telestration device was developed to facilitate dynamic user interaction with live video streams. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to find the perceived usability, ergonomics, and educational value of a first-generation handheld wireless telestration platform. METHODS: A prototype was developed with four core hand-held functions: (1) free-hand annotation, (2) cursor navigation, (3) overlay and manipulation (rotation) of ghost (avatar) instrumentation, and (4) hand-held video feed navigation on a remote monitor. This device uses a proprietary augmented reality platform. Surgeons and trainees were invited to test the core functions of the platform by performing standardized tasks. Usability and ergonomics were evaluated with a validated system usability scale and a 5-point Likert scale survey, which also evaluated the perceived educational value of the device. RESULTS: In total, 10 people (9 surgeons and 1 senior resident; 5 male and 5 female) participated. Participants strongly agreed or agreed (SA/A) that it was easy to perform annotations (SA/A 9, 90% and neutral 0, 0%), video feed navigation (SA/A 8, 80% and neutral 1, 10%), and manipulation of ghost (avatar) instruments on the monitor (SA/A 6, 60% and neutral 3, 30%). Regarding ergonomics, 40% (4) of participants agreed or strongly agreed (neutral 4, 40%) that the device was physically comfortable to use and hold. These results are consistent with open-ended comments on the device's size and weight. The average system usability scale was 70 (SD 12.5; median 75, IQR 63-84) indicating an above average usability score. Participants responded favorably to the device's perceived educational value, particularly for postoperative coaching (agree 6, 60%, strongly agree 4, 40%). CONCLUSIONS: This study presents the preliminary usability results of a novel first-generation telestration tool customized for use in surgical coaching. Favorable usability and perceived educational value were reported. Future iterations of the device should focus on incorporating user feedback and additional studies should be conducted to evaluate its effectiveness for improving surgical education. Ultimately, such tools can be incorporated into pedagogical models of surgical coaching to optimize feedback and training."

Accurate and timely symptom monitoring is critical to offering prompt and time-sensitive clinical services. Digital health is a promising solution for the barriers encountered by conventional symptom monitoring approaches, including accessibility, the ecological validity of assessments, and recall bias. However, to date, there has been no digital health technology developed to support self-management for people with psychosis in China. OBJECTIVE: We report the study protocol to evaluate the validity, feasibility, acceptability, usability, and safety of a symptom self-monitoring smartphone app (YouXin; Chinese name ) for people with psychosis in China. METHODS: This is a nonrandomized validity and feasibility study with a mixed methods design. The study was approved by the University of Manchester and Beijing Anding Hospital Research Ethics Committee. YouXin is a smartphone app designed to facilitate symptom self-monitoring for people with psychosis. YouXin has 2 core functions: active monitoring of symptoms (ie, smartphone survey) and passive monitoring of behavioral activity (ie, passive data collection via embedded smartphone sensors). The development process of YouXin utilized a systematic coproduction approach. A series of coproduction consultation meetings was conducted by the principal researcher with service users and clinicians to maximize the usability and acceptability of the app for end users. Participants with psychosis aged 16 years to 65 years were recruited from Beijing Anding Hospital, Beijing, China. All participants were invited to use the YouXin app to self-monitor symptoms for 4 weeks. At the end of the 4-week follow-up, we invited participants to take part in a qualitative interview to explore the acceptability of the app and trial procedures postintervention. RESULTS: Recruitment to the study was initiated in August 2022. Of the 47 participants who were approached for the study from August 2022 to October 2022, 41 participants agreed to take part in the study. We excluded 1 of the 41 participants for not meeting the inclusion criteria, leaving a total of 40 participants who began the study. As of December 2022, 40 participants had completed the study, and the recruitment was complete. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to develop and test a symptom self-monitoring app specifically designed for people with psychosis in China. If the study shows the feasibility of YouXin, a potential future direction is to integrate the app into clinical workflows to facilitate digital mental health care for people with psychosis in China. This study will inform improvements to the app, trial procedures, and implementation strategies with this population. Moreover, the findings of this trial could lead to optimization of digital health technologies designed for people with psychosis in China.

Primary outcomes were feasibility (use of the platform) and acceptability (willingness to use the platform in the future). Secondary outcomes assessed preliminary effectiveness (30-day readmissions, emergency department visits, and missed clinic appointments). RESULTS: A total of 56 participants were randomized (control: n=31; intervention: n=25) and 47 participants (control: n=28; intervention: n=19) completed all trial activities. Intervention participants who completed trial activities wore the digital sensor on 78% of study days with mean use of 11.4 (SD 4.6) hours/day, completed symptom questionnaires on 75% of study days, used the blood pressure monitor 1.1 (SD 0.19) times/day, and used the digital weight scale 1 (SD 0.13) time/day. Of intervention participants, 100% responded very or somewhat true to the statement ""If I have access to the [platform] moving forward, I will use it."" Some (n=9, 47%) intervention participants indicated they required support to use the digital platform. A total of 19 (100%) intervention participants and 25 (89%) control participants had ≥5 CHW interactions during the 30-day study period. All intervention (n=19, 100%) and control (n=26, 93%) participants who completed trial activities indicated their CHW interactions were ""very satisfying."" In the full sample (N=56), fewer participants in the intervention group were readmitted 30 days after hospital discharge compared to the control group (n=3, 12% vs n=8, 26%; P=.12). Both arms had similar rates of missed clinic appointments and emergency department visits. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot trial of a digitally-enabled CHW intervention for HF demonstrated feasibility, acceptability, and a clinically relevant reduction in 30-day readmissions among participants who received the intervention. Additional investigation is needed in a larger trial to determine the effect of this intervention on HF home management and clinical outcomes.

Hypertension control is declining due to multiple factors including lack of access to primary care. Consequently, patients with hypertension frequently visit the emergency department (ED) due to high blood pressure (BP). Telehealth for Emergency-Community Continuity of Care Connectivity via Home-Telemonitoring Blood Pressure is a pilot project that implements and evaluates a comprehensive home blood pressure telemonitoring (HBPT) and physician case management protocol designed as a postdischarge management strategy to support patients with asymptomatic elevated BP as they transition from the ED to home. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to conduct a feasibility study of an HBPT program for patients with asymptomatic elevated BP discharged from the ED. METHODS: Patients discharged from an urban, tertiary care hospital ED with asymptomatic elevated BP were recruited in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, and provided with HBPT technology for 3 months of monitoring post discharge and referred to specialist hypertension clinics. Participants monitored their BP twice in the morning and evenings and tele-transmitted readings via Bluetooth Sensor each day using an app. A monitoring clinician received these data and monitored the patient's condition daily and adjusted antihypertensive medications. Feasibility outcomes included eligibility, recruitment, adherence to monitoring, and retention rates. Secondary outcomes included proportion of those who were defined as having hypertension post-ED visits, changes in mean BP, overall BP control, medication adherence, changes to antihypertensive medications, quality of life, and end user experience at 3 months. RESULTS: A total of 46 multiethnic patients (mean age 63, SD 17 years, 69%, n=32 women) found to have severe hypertension (mean 191, SD 23/mean 100, SD 14 mm Hg) in the ED were recruited, initiated on HBPT with hypertension specialist physician referral and followed up for 3 months. Eligibility and recruitment rates were 40% (56/139) and 88% (49/56), respectively. The proportion of participants that completed ≥80% of home BP measurements at 1 and 3 months were 67% (31/46) and 41% (19/46), respectively. The proportion of individuals who achieved home systolic BP and diastolic BP control at 3 months was 71.4% (30/42) and 85.7% (36/42) respectively. Mean home systolic and diastolic BP improved by -13/-5 mm Hg after initiation of HBPT to the end of the study. Patients were prescribed 1 additional antihypertensive medication. No differences in medication adherence from enrollment to 3 months were noted. Most patients (76%, 25/33) were highly satisfied with the HBPT program and 76% (25/33) found digital health tools easy to use. CONCLUSIONS: HBPT intervention is a feasible postdischarge management strategy and can be beneficial in supporting patients with asymptomatic elevated BP from the ED. A randomized trial is underway to evaluate the efficacy of this intervention on BP control."

This study aims to assess parental acceptance and use of a commercially available intraoral camera (IOC) for effective remote monitoring. METHODS: 47 child-parent dyads, where the parent was the main caregiver and the child was treated under general anaesthesia for early childhood caries, were recruited. Caregivers were trained to image their child's teeth on a commercially available IOC. Subsequently, submitted images were reviewed asynchronously by dentists for image quality, presence of dislodged fillings, abscesses, cavitation, and oral hygiene. Post-surgery monitoring was performed using teledentistry at 1 and 2 months and in-person at 4 months. A modified Telehealth Usability Questionnaire (TUQ) was used to record caregiver acceptance for study procedures. RESULTS: A mean TUQ of 6.09 out of 7 was scored by caregivers. Caregiver-reported issues were limited to problems with technique and child uncooperativeness. The number of clear images during the second teledentistry review was improved compared to the first (p = 0.007). 68% of children liked having images of their teeth taken. CONCLUSION: This study supports the feasibility of using an IOC as a clinically appropriate avenue for teledentistry with a high level of caregiver-child acceptance."

There is growing evidence that ATs in the home environment can reduce workload for formal carers (FCs) and ICs, reduce care costs, and can have a positive influence on quality of life (QoL) for PwD and their caregivers. In practice, using multiple ATs still often implies using different separate point solutions and applications. However, the integral, combined use of the data generated using various applications can potentially enhance the insight into the health and wellbeing status of PwD and can provide decision support for carers. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the use of a DSS that integrated multiple ATs into one dashboard through a small-scale field study. METHODS: The current study presents the formative evaluation of a Decision Support System (DSS) connected to multiple ATs. This DSS has been developed by means of co-creation during an international project. The DSS provides an insight into the physical and cognitive status of a PwD, as well as an insight into sleep activity and general wellbeing. Semi-structured interview sessions were held in three countries (Netherlands, Italy, and Taiwan) with 41 participants to gain insight into the experiences of formal and informal carers and PwD with both the ATs and the DSS Alpha prototype dashboard. RESULTS: The results showed that participants using the DSS were satisfied and perceived added value and a fit with certain care demands from the PwD. In general, ICs and FCs have limited insight into the status of PwD living independently at home, and in these moments, the DSS dashboard and AT bundle can provide valuable insights. Participants experienced the DSS dashboard as well-organized and easy to navigate. The accuracy of the data displayed in the dashboard is important, the context, and (perceived) privacy issues should be tackled according to all users. Furthermore, based in the insight gained during the evaluation a set of design improvements was composed which can be used to further improve the DSS for the Beta evaluation. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The current paper evaluates a possible solution for excess AT usage and how the use of a DSS which integrated multiple AT into one single technology could support caregivers in providing care for PwD. The formative evaluation scrutinized the integration of the developed DSS and the composed bundle of ATs across diverse cultural contexts. Insights from multi-center observations shed light on user experiences, encompassing overall usability, navigational efficacy, and attitudes toward the system. FCs and ICs expressed positivity toward the DSS dashboard's design and functionalities, highlighting its utility in remote monitoring, tracking changes in the person's abilities, and managing urgent situations. There is a need for personalized solutions and the findings contribute to a nuanced understanding of DSS and AT integration, providing insights for future developments and research in the field of DSS for the care of PwD."

Wearable or home electronic devices with the function of transmitting information at a distance are used for the purpose of remote dynamic monitoring of the condition of patients. Aim. To determine the effectiveness of the use of ""new"" criteria for assessing the health status of patients with broncho-obstructive diseases in order to monitor remotely. Material and methods. 28 patients with broncho-obstructive diseases who were admitted for inpatient treatment were examined. Most of them had comorbidities, mainly cardiovascular pathology. A general clinical examination and special research methods were performed: an interactive survey using the respiratory module of the Electronic Polyclinic program, remote monitoring of vital signs using a smart watch and a mobile application for recording and transmitting information, a 6-minute walk test with simultaneous recording of vital signs with using a smart watch, a questionnaire and a scale for assessing the usability of the System usability scale system. The analysis of the results was performed by using the Statistica 13.0 software package. Results and discussion. Interactive survey corresponded to the severity of dyspnea according to the mMRC and Borg scales. The 6-minute walk test showed a significant limitation of physical activity and an increase in heart rate. The deep sleep phase has been limited. The CRP index averaged 7.78±8.48 µg/l. More than 85% of patients expressed their willingness to continue observation. The results of the correlation analysis demonstrated a direct relationship with the patient's physical activity assessment and the results of the 6-minute walk test, and an inverse relationship with the 6-minute walk test result and the patients' age, severity of respiratory failure and CRP concentration. The duration of deep sleep is inversely correlated with the SpO2 value. Our studies made it possible to compare the obtained data with the results of traditional methods of examining a patient, to confirm the position that the physical activity of a patient with broncho-obstructive disease is connected with indicators of the function of external respiration, and also that the total duration of sleep of COPD patients mainly consists of light sleep with a decrease in the duration of deep sleep. An inverse relationship was found with the duration of deep sleep and the concentration of CRP and the value of SpO2. The described monitoring system allows you to timely adjust the treatment regimen, reduce the number of hospitalizations, the risk of exacerbation or death.Conclusion. Additional instrumental control of vital parameters increases the efficiency of the system of long-term remote monitoring of patients with broncho-obstructive diseases. the indicators represent the severity of the symptoms of the disease and the degree of violations of the indicators of the function of external respiration. © 2023 LLC ""IMC"" Modern Clinical Medicine.

For very low pressures, a sensor with high sensitivity and bulky, expensive measuring equipment is required to obtain the output signal. The incorporation of a micro-pyramidal porous dielectric section can considerably enhance the sensitivity of the capacitance-based pressure sensor. This article has employed a finite element method-based three-dimensional simulation to assess the performance of the porous microstructured capacitive pressure sensor (pmcps). The numerical results revealed a high level of agreement with the experimental data. To simplify the design and fabrication of the sensor with optimal performance, the effects of parameters such as sensor dielectric constant, dielectric layer porosity, base length, tip width, height, and inter-microstructural spacing of porous micro-pyramids were investigated using the response surface methodology. Sensitivity analysis showed that the tip width of the micro-pyramid has the greatest effect on sensor sensitivity and the least effect on the initial capacitance. Finally, equations were proposed for predicting the initial capacitance and sensor sensitivity based on the geometric parameters of the porous micro-pyramid and intrinsic properties of the dielectric section using three-dimensional finite element simulation to facilitate the ability to predict the fabrication and design process of the pmcps and optimize its performance for different applications. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023."

The reducing cost of manufacturing, deployment and the small and unobtrusive nature of most of the wearables available have intensified the acceptability for deployment in areas such as medical devices for healthcare monitoring. This work explored the use of artificial intelligence to enhance authentication of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) through a design of a framework. The framework is designed using wearable and or with a mobile device for extracting bioelectrical signals and context awareness data. The framework uses bioelectrical signals for authentication while artificial intelligence is applied using the contextual data to enhance the patient data integrity. The framework applied different security levels to balance between usability and security on the bases of False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and False Rejection Rate (FRR). 30 people are used for the evaluation of the different security levels and the security level 1 achieved a result based on usability vs security obtaining FAR of 5.6% and FRR of 9% but when the FAR is at 0% the FRR stood at 29%. The Intelligent Authentication Framework for Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) will be of advantage in increasing the trust of data extracted for the purpose of user authentication by reducing the FRR percentage. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

While much research has focused on patient facing mobile technologies, there remains limited evidence of the implications of technologies on models of care and health service delivery. In this paper, we present an evaluation of the clinician experiences of using a bidirectional healthcare platform, Activate TKR, for orthopaedic patients undergoing a Total Knee Replacement (TKR). The platform provides mobile-enabled media rich content to support patients through their journey, while facilitating data sharing and remote monitoring by clinicians. Results show that physiotherapists experienced the greatest enhancements in care delivery through access to patient generated information which improved appointments, status and progress discussion, and tailoring of physiotherapy. Surgeons found value in the mobile-enabled information patients accessed in preparation for surgery, enhancing their overall TKR experience. © 2020 IEEE."

These patients are severe handicapped persons who cannot interfere with real world by normal ways like speech, writing or language signs. Fortunately, these persons can see or can hear and they understand the meaning of different messages. The developed medical system is made by the following main functional components: the patient equipment, server, and caretaker device, connected together by using Internet available infrastructure. The bidirectional communication is performed by using keywords technology or ideograms presented on the patient’s screen provided by an application running at the server and accessed by the patient through a web browser. Patient needs are performed by using for interfacing with a software application by using different types of sensors including switch-type sensors (tactile, pressure, strain gauge) or eye tracking devices, all of these adapted to the patient’s physical condition. The medical system has also a secondary function, the remote monitoring of few vital physiological parameters needed for patient treatment and rehabilitation, based on wireless and wearable sensor network, that share the same hardware platform. The application running on caretaker device displays the patient’s needs together with the values of the selected physiological parameters in real time. The medical devices are responsible for physiological parameters acquiring, preprocessing and forwarding into the server. The server performs the parameters processing and computing the medical condition of the patient and also has the ability of sending alerts to the caretaker when one or more parameters are outside the normal limits. The application running on server manages the system databases, the communication protocols between patient and caretaker devices, records and processes the remote monitored data values and alarms the caretaker devices in emergency situations. The prototype of the developed medical system has been successfully within Clinic of “Geriatrics and Gerontology” at “Dr. C. I. Parhon” Hospital of Iaşi, Romania. The assistive solution proposed can be used in hospitals, care and treatment centers, nursing homes and also for patients treated in outpatient settings.

Simultaneous sensing of pressure and temperature has been realized by obtaining separated signals utilizing independent piezoresistive and thermoelectric sensing mechanisms, respectively. However, temperature variations induced resistance change poses a negative influence on the pressure sensing accuracy. In this study, a flexible pressure–temperature dual parameter sensor with hierarchical porous structure is presented. The conductivity is realized by inserting graphene into a multilayer structured thermoplastic polyurethane/carbon nanofibers (TPU/CNFs) sponge. The hierarchical porous structured TPU/CNFs sponge with graphene coating endows the sensor with a high pressure sensitivity of 0.14 kPa−1 (0–60 kPa) and a high temperature sensitivity of 30.8 μV/K. Moreover, in the dual parameter mode, the sensor demonstrates neglectable mutual interference between pressure and temperature signals due to lowered temperature-induced resistance change by surface coating of graphene. We show that the sensor can be integrated inside the mask to monitor real-time human respiration. It is also used as the sensing part of a robot arm for high temperature alarm and automatic evacuation. The excellent performance of the sensor ensures its promising application in healthcare monitoring, prosthesis and human–machine interaction (HMI) systems. © 2021"

However, poor cycle stability, low sensitivity and narrow working pressure range hinder the further development of the pressure sensors. To solve the above mentioned problems, a polyurethane-based conductive sponge is prepared via silver nanoparticle coating after the in-situ synthesis of poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) on the backbones of polyurethane foam. The flexible pressure sensor exhibits excellent performance, including ultrahigh sensitivity (3.039 kPa−1), wide working range (0–35 kPa), frequency-independent performance, reliable repeatability (~ 1000 cycles), rapid and stable response. Finally, we successfully demonstrated these flexible sensors in detecting tiny physiological activities and human motions.

However, the realization of highly flexible and extremely sensitive magnetic sensors remains a challenge. Here, we report a cost-effective, flexible, and ultra-sensitive heterostructural magnetoelectric (ME) sensor consisting of piezoelectric Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 (PZT) thick films and Metglas foils. The flexible sensor exhibits a strong ME coefficient of 19.3 V cm-1 Oe-1 at low frequencies and 280.5 V cm-1 Oe-1 at resonance due to the exceptionally high piezoelectric coefficient d33 ∼72 pC N-1 of the constituent PZT thick films. The flexible ME sensor possesses not only ultrahigh sensitivities of 200 nT at low frequencies and 200 pT at resonance but also shows an excellent mechanical endurance. Through 5000 bending cycles (radii of ∼1 cm), the sensors showed no fatigue-induced performance degradation.

But conventional materials showed impermeability, single sensing ability, and no designated therapy, which hindered their applications. Thus it was still a great challenge to develop electronic devices with multifunctional sensing properties and self-driven anti-infection therapy. Herein, flexible and breathable on-skin electronic devices for multifunctional fabric based sensing and self-driven designated anti-infection therapy were prepared successfully with cellulose nanocrystals/iron(III) ion/polyvinyl alcohol (CNC/Fe3+/PVA) composite. The resultant composite films possessed robust mechanical performances, outstanding conductivity, and distinguished breathability (3.03 kg/(m2·d)), which benefited from the multiple interactions of weak hydrogen bonds and Fe3+ chelation and synergistic effects among CNC, polyaniline (PANI), and PVA. Surprisingly, the film could be assembled as a multifunctional sensor to actively monitor real-time physical and infection related signals such as temperature, moisture, pH, NH3, and human movements even at sweat states. More importantly, this multifunctional device could act as a self-driven therapist to eliminate bacterial by the release of Fe3+, which was driven by the damage of metal coordination Fe-O bonds due to the high temperature caused by infection at wound sites. Thus, the composite films had potential versatile applications in electronic skins, smart wound dressings, human-machine interactions, and self-driven anti-infection therapy.
