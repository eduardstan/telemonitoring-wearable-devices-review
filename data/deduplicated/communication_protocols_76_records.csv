This article presents a novel architecture that integrates PUF, blockchain, and Tangle for Security-by-Design (SbD) of healthcare cyber-physical systems (H-CPSs). Healthcare systems around the world have undergone massive technological transformation and have seen growing adoption with the advancement of Internet-of-Medical Things (IoMT). The technological transformation of healthcare systems to telemedicine, e-health, connected health, and remote health is being made possible with the sophisticated integration of IoMT with machine learning, big data, artificial intelligence (AI), and other technologies. As healthcare systems are becoming more accessible and advanced, security and privacy have become pivotal for the smooth integration and functioning of various systems in H-CPSs. In this work, we present a novel approach that integrates PUF with IOTA Tangle and blockchain and works by storing the PUF keys of a patient's Body Area Network (BAN) inside blockchain to access, store, and share globally. Each patient has a network of smart wearables and a gateway to obtain the physiological sensor data securely. To facilitate communication among various stakeholders in healthcare systems, IOTA Tangle's Masked Authentication Messaging (MAM) communication protocol has been used, which securely enables patients to communicate, share, and store data on Tangle. The MAM channel works in the restricted mode in the proposed architecture, which can be accessed using the patient's gateway PUF key. Furthermore, the successful verification of PUF enables patients to securely send and share physiological sensor data from various wearable and implantable medical devices embedded with PUF. Finally, healthcare system entities like physicians, hospital admin networks, and remote monitoring systems can securely establish communication with patients using MAM and retrieve the patient's BAN PUF keys from the blockchain securely. Our experimental analysis shows that the proposed approach successfully integrates three security primitives, PUF, blockchain, and Tangle, providing decentralized access control and security in H-CPS with minimal energy requirements, data storage, and response time."

Methods: Two versions of the system, which consisted of a portable bike and a tablet PC, were designed to communicate through either Bluetooth low energy (BLE) or Wi-Fi interfaces for real-time monitoring of exercise progress by both the users and their clinical team. The third version of the iBikE system consisted of a motorized bike and a tablet PC. It utilized conventional Bluetooth to implement remote control of the motorized bike’s speed during an exercise session as well as to provide real-time visualization of the exercise progress. We developed three customized tablet PC apps with similar user interfaces but different communication protocols for all the platforms to provide a graphical representation of exercise progress. The same microcontroller unit (MCU), ESP-32, was used in all the systems. Results: Each system was tested in 1-minute exercise sessions at various speeds. To evaluate the accuracy of the measured data, in addition to reading speed values from the iBikE app, the cycling speed of the bikes was measured continuously using a tachometer. The mean differences of averaged RPMs for both data sets were calculated. The calculated values were 0.38 ± 0.03, 0.25 ± 0.27, and 6.7 ± 3.3 for the BLE system, the Wi-Fi system, and the conventional Bluetooth system, respectively. Conclusion: All interfaces provided sufficient accuracy for use in telerehabilitation."

In WBANs, biosensors are placed on the patient's body that sense and transmit physiological data to the paired medical personnel. Such medical setups are appropriate for COVID-19 patient monitoring, where the patient remains isolated for an extended period. Sometimes, human body parts impede the signals transmitted by biosensors to the coordinator and this type of occlusion lasts for a longer duration during sleeping human postures. In such circumstances, an intermediate biosensor forwards the signals of the occluded biosensor node. The forwarding of messages results in quick depletion of energy resources at the intermediate biosensor, affecting the overall WBAN services. To resolve this, first, we propose an adaptive Relay-Node Centric (RNC) relay-based communication protocol for WBANs, which reduces energy used in relaying and improves the stability period of the network. Second, we design a novel simulation model using an existing real-life experimental dataset to simulate a WBAN placed on the sleeping patient's body. We derive a Discrete Markov Chain (DTMC) model from real-life data and use human biomechanisms to simulate biosensors' connectivity status in four human sleeping positions. Lastly, we evaluate the performance of RNC against the existing cost-function-based and Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) based relay selection protocols. Results obtained on the real-life dataset and designed simulation model show that RNC outperforms the existing methods in terms of network stability period and packet success ratio."

Modern, high-speed wireless communication technologies that employ complex network and communication protocols and standards have quickly supplanted the traditional wired scheme of communication. Wireless medical sensor networks are a promising application of WSNs in healthcare since they allow for remote patient monitoring (WMSNs). Reliable patient communication, patient mobility, and energy-efficient routing are at the forefront of current WMSN healthcare research developments. Nonetheless, patients' personal information is at risk when new technologies are implemented in healthcare applications without proper security measures being taken. In this study, we present a privacy-preserving strategy for the secure transfer of medical records over WSNs by combining secret sharing, and hashing. The healthcare information gathered by a wireless sensor network is broken down into subsets. In addition, a popular hashing algorithm is used to determine a unique identifier for each constituent. Any alterations to the message will result in a different hash value. Multipath routing is then used to send these parts to the servers. In order to verify the efficacy of the new method, this paper presents comprehensive simulations. The results indicate that secret splitting, in conjunction with multipath routing, aids in the maintenance of confidentiality in a wireless sensor network-based healthcare scheme."

There is need to move beyond supervised assessments in the laboratory/clinic. Longitudinal free-living assessment can provide a wealth of information on patient pathology and habitual behaviour, but cost and complexity of equipment have typically been a barrier. Lack of supervised conditions within free-living assessment means there is need to augment these studies with environmental analysis to provide context to individual measurements. This paper reviews low-cost and accessible Internet of Things (IoT) technologies with the aim of informing biomedical engineers of possibilities, workflows and limitations they present. In doing so, we evidence their use within healthcare research through literature and experimentation. As hardware becomes more affordable and feature rich, the cost of data magnifies. This can be limiting for biomedical engineers exploring low-cost solutions as data costs can make IoT approaches unscalable. IoT technologies can be exploited by biomedical engineers, but more research is needed before these technologies can become commonplace for clinicians and healthcare practitioners.

These devices significantly improve the patient's lifestyle as they permit remote monitoring and transmission of health data (i.e., telemedicine), lowering the treatment costs for both the patient and the healthcare providers. Although specific SHS communication standards (i.e., ISO/IEEE 11073) enable real-time plug-and-play interoperability and communication between different personal medical devices, they do not specify any features for secure communications. In this paper, we demonstrate how personal medical device communication is indeed vulnerable to different cyber attacks. Specifically, we show how an external attacker can hook into the personal medical device's communication and eavesdrop the sensitive health data traffic, and implement manin-the-middle, replay, false data injection, and denial-of-service attacks. Furthermore, we also propose an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), HEKA, to monitor personal medical device traffic and detect attacks on them. HEKA passively hooks into the personal medical traffic generated by medical devices to learn the contiguous sequence of packets information from the captured traffic and detects irregular traffic-flow patterns using an n-grambased approach and different machine learning techniques. We implemented HEKA in a testbed consisting of eight off-the-shelf personal medical devices and evaluated its performance against four different attacks.

In an SoS environment, the entire system is divided into sub-systems, which provides more flexibility and reduces the management cost of the entire system. SoS have been widely used in healthcare monitoring services, where patients are provided with medical sensors that send their medical measurements to a remote unit for further processing and decision-making. These sensors communicate with an access point using the wireless channel, which gives patients flexibility in mobility and makes the monitoring system more convenient and comfortable. However, sending data over the wireless channel presents several challenges, such as contention between the different sensors in accessing the channel and the bit errors associated with the noisy wireless channel. In this paper, an SoS healthcare monitoring framework is proposed, where a wireless communication protocol is proposed that addresses the sensors’ node network access contention and mitigates the bit errors of the communication channel by providing forward error correction bits to the transmitted packets. In addition, the protocol takes into consideration the sensors’ importance and criticality, such that more important sensors are given more network access time and more error correction bits, which in turn results in a robust transmission process with low transmission delay. The simulation results show the proposed wireless communication protocol’s effectiveness in lowering the packet loss, giving higher priority and having higher throughput for the more critical sensors."

The medical sensors attached to the human body in RPM system experience varying channel quality due to body movements. This paper analyzes the signal received from RPM sensors when a patient rotates by different angles while sitting on a chair as well as heed the use of a relay node placed on his/her body. Literature suggests many relay-based communication protocols to deliver physio-signals efficiently in an RPM application. However, limited studies have focused on the position of a relay node on the human body. In this paper, we empirically analyze the off-body communication path of sensor nodes by collecting data from different body orientations in a residential room. We estimate the path loss parameters for underweight, normal and overweight body mass index (BMI) categories. The estimated parameters are then used to simulate the physical layer of a home-based indoor RPM application. We inspect different relay node positions on the human body and allude an optimal position of the relay node that cover the transmission range of all sensors and provides an improved channel quality. We improve the Quality of Service (QoS) during non-line-of-sight (NLOS) situation and design an adaptive cross-layer communication protocol for WBANs."

Consequently, these parameters are monitored manually or even go unnoticed by maintenance personnel, due to the lack of the necessary tools for constant monitoring. Temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide and the intensity of environmental acoustic noise are the main parameters that will allow the validation of air quality. Thus, a remote monitoring system based on IoT is proposed that allows viewing all these parameters in a centralized and remote way. This system will have a special focus on the intensive care ward, as it is a critical area that requires a high level of monitoring and supervision for its conditions. By experimentation, it allowed tests to be conducted in different environments such as controlled environments, angiography operating rooms and finally the target room, which is the intensive care unit. Sensor data was corroborated by other measurement instruments as well as other similar sensors.

Though, many nations have finished the clinical trials period of vaccination and started vaccination to people, still there are many uncertainties such as how these vaccines will work to the people with severe illness, which vaccine is more effective compared to others etc. Moreover, vaccination may not provide a full protection against the current situation since there are new variants of corona virus and the number of affected people increasing again. Therefore, a proper diseases detection and individual monitoring system to maintain a smart quarantine facility is still very much needed to minimise the rapid spread of covid-19 and other contagious virus. Here, wearable tools could play important roles to provide valuable information of tracking people such as real-time remote monitoring, contact tracing symptoms prediction etc. to establish and maintain a proper quarantine system. In this manuscript we proposed a geofencing system with a wristband, integrating it with IOT and GPS to trace Covid-19 patients inside a boundary.

In the area of electronic health (eHealth), many of these devices provide remote transfer of health data, as a result of the increasing need for ambulatory monitoring of patients. This has a potential to reduce the cost of care due to prevention and early detection. Objective: The objective of this study was to provide an overview of available wearable sensor systems with data exchange possibilities. Due to the heterogeneous capabilities these systems possess today, we aimed to systematize this in terms of usage, where there is a need of, or users benefit from, transferring self-collected data to health care actors. Methods: We searched for and reviewed relevant sensor systems (i.e., devices) and mapped these into 13 selected attributes related to data-exchange capabilities. We collected data from the Vandrico database of wearable devices, and complemented the information with an additional internet search. We classified the following attributes of devices: type, communication interfaces, data protocols, smartphone/PC integration, connection to smartphone health platforms, 3rd party integration with health platforms, connection to health care system/middleware, type of gathered health data, integrated sensors, medical device certification, access to user data, developer-access to device, and market status. Devices from the same manufacturer with similar functionalities/characteristics were identified under the same device family. Furthermore, we classified the systems in three subgroups of relevance for different actors in mobile health monitoring systems: EHR providers, software developers, and patient users. Results: We identified 362 different mobile health monitoring devices belonging to 193 device families. Based on an analysis of these systems, we identified the following general challenges: • Few systems have a Conformité Européene (CE) marking class II or above, or approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) • Few systems use the standardized Bluetooth Low Energy GATT profile for wireless transfer of health data • Few systems support health middleware • Approximately 30% of the device families provide the user access to the source data. However, only 16% allow the transfer of data through direct communication with the device (i.e., without using a proprietary cloud-based service) Conclusions: Few of the identified mobile health monitoring systems use standardized, open communication protocols, which would allow the user to directly acquire sensor data. Use of open protocols can provide mobile health (mHealth) application developers an alternative to proprietary cloud services and communication tools, which are often closely integrated with the devices. Emerging new types of sensors, often intended for everyday use, have a potential to supplement health records systems with data that can enrich patient care. © 2019 Elsevier B.V."

These patients are severe handicapped persons who cannot interfere with real world by normal ways like speech, writing or language signs. Fortunately, these persons can see or can hear and they understand the meaning of different messages. The developed medical system is made by the following main functional components: the patient equipment, server, and caretaker device, connected together by using Internet available infrastructure. The bidirectional communication is performed by using keywords technology or ideograms presented on the patient’s screen provided by an application running at the server and accessed by the patient through a web browser. Patient needs are performed by using for interfacing with a software application by using different types of sensors including switch-type sensors (tactile, pressure, strain gauge) or eye tracking devices, all of these adapted to the patient’s physical condition. The medical system has also a secondary function, the remote monitoring of few vital physiological parameters needed for patient treatment and rehabilitation, based on wireless and wearable sensor network, that share the same hardware platform. The application running on caretaker device displays the patient’s needs together with the values of the selected physiological parameters in real time. The medical devices are responsible for physiological parameters acquiring, preprocessing and forwarding into the server. The server performs the parameters processing and computing the medical condition of the patient and also has the ability of sending alerts to the caretaker when one or more parameters are outside the normal limits. The application running on server manages the system databases, the communication protocols between patient and caretaker devices, records and processes the remote monitored data values and alarms the caretaker devices in emergency situations. The prototype of the developed medical system has been successfully within Clinic of “Geriatrics and Gerontology” at “Dr. C. I. Parhon” Hospital of Iaşi, Romania. The assistive solution proposed can be used in hospitals, care and treatment centers, nursing homes and also for patients treated in outpatient settings.

Wearables provides a low-cost and technologically advanced approach to measure sleep over time in free-living conditions, with miniaturized sensors, wireless data transfer protocols, mobile- and cloud-based platform for data management and visualization, and easy integration with other services. The unprecedented amount of data generated by CST has the potential to improve our understanding of sleep and its disorders in natural settings, providing insight into the relationship between sleep, behavior, and health. In parallel with the growing utilization of telemedicine, remote patient monitoring is becoming increasingly relevant in medicine and therefore, the use of CST will likely augment the diagnosis and management of sleep disorders. The ownership of CST by the patient, as opposed to the health system, allows for sleep tracking to take place prior to and between patient-provider interactions, which could transform the current framework of sleep medicine care delivery. Additionally, the use of CST alongside the recording of other health-metrics with digital tools (e.g., blood pressure cuffs, scales, glucometers, mobile apps for symptoms tracking) may ultimately reveal the interactions between sleep and patient comorbidities (e.g., hypertension, diabetes) in ambulatory settings. Despite this potential, CST is largely unregulated and has yet-unsolved intrinsic limitations inherent to a consumer-oriented product. For example, CST lacks major requirements of traditional clinical/research tools, including transparency in the algorithms used, control of, and access to raw data. The scientific community has been actively examining the performance of CST, considering these limitations, and continues to provide guidance on how to move forward with CST in basic and clinical sleep research. Here, we discuss performance, rationale, theoretical and practical guidelines for testing and using wearable CST. © 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved"

RHMS reduces the number of unessential hospitalizations by providing the required healthcare services for patients at home. Furthermore, continuous health monitoring using RHMS is a hopeful solution for elderly people suffering from chronic diseases. RHMS is in general three tiers architecture where the first tier uses intelligent wearable sensors to gather physiological signs. The majority of wearable sensors constructors commercialized sensing devices with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication interfaces, which lead to the development of diverse RHMS deploying BLE communication interfaces for physiological patient data gathering.

By integrating both virtual and physical worlds, IoT creates an integrated communication framework of interrelated things and operating systems. With the advent of IoT systems based on digital remote care, transferring medical data is becoming a daily routine. Healthcare is one of the most popular IoT applications and tries to monitor patients' vital signs during the day for weeks and to eliminate the need for hospitalization. In a healthcare system, many sensors are installed to collect the patient's information, including environmental monitoring sensors and vital and unstructured message sensors in order to reduce the patients' expenses. The IoT network contains flexible sensors in dynamically changing environments where sensors collect environmental information and send it to nursing stations for healthcare applications. Due to the wireless nature of IoT networks, secure data transmission in the healthcare context is very important. Data collected from sensors embedded in healthcare devices may be lost for various reasons along the transmission path. Therefore, establishing a secure communication path in IoT networks in the context of healthcare is of great importance. In this paper, in order to provide a reliable data transfer protocol in the context of healthcare, a reliable routing using multiobjective genetic algorithm (RRMOGA) method is presented. The contribution of this paper can be summarized in two steps: (i) using a multiobjective optimization approach to find near-optimal paths and (ii) using reliable agents in the network to find backup paths. The simulation outcomes reveal that the proposed approach, based on the use of the multiobjective optimization approach, tries to find optimal paths for information transfer that improve the main parameters of the network. Also, the use of secure agents leads to a secure information transfer in the network in the context of healthcare. Experimental results show that the proposed method has achieved reliability and data delivery rates, 99% and 99.9%, respectively. The proposed method has improved network lifetime, delivery rate, and delay by 14%, 2%, and 5.6%, respectively.  © 2021 Saeed Javid and Abbas Mirzaei."

Sensor nodes (motes) are usually located under the skin, implanted deep in the body, or ingested, as in the rare case of smart pills for medical and non-medical usage. Since the necessary connections of wearable and implantable devices are wireless, and the components use low batteries, processing and transferring the critical data can deplete the nodes’ power. In most cases, it is impossible to exchange or re-power batteries. Holter monitoring, loop recorders, and wireless capsule endoscopy are some of the WBAN’s applications for saving and transferring medical data. Wireless capsule endoscopy is the application for image transmission in WBANs, and the image compression in common is a specific segment of capsule endoscopy. Since the better compression of images increases the frame rate and typically improves the diagnosis process, selecting the compression algorithm should be relevant. The considerable scope of this comprehensive study pays attention to the various biomedical data compression approaches in WBANs. This paper focuses on power-efficient schemes of remote healthcare networks. In this survey article, the energy-based biomedical data compression approaches of WBANs and remote healthcare networks are accurately classified based on lossy, lossless, and hybrid techniques; later, a comprehensive comparison of each specific method’s power consumption is presented. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
