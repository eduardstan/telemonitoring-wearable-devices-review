Patients often require life-long specialized treatment, but timely interventions are frequently hindered by the limited availability of specialists. Telemedical solutions at specialized centers enabling patient-physician interaction hold promise in bridging this gap, but are not yet available for MG. We developed 'MyaLink,' a remote monitoring platform tailored for MG, and outline the study design assessing the platform and clinical outcomes regarding telemedical intervention. Additionally, we present study results on care-related aspects in MG prior to telemedical intervention to identify challenges in the current care provision process. Design: The platform comprises a patient app and a physician portal, enabling systematic symptom monitoring using data from patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), coupled devices and a communication module. The randomized controlled study included 45 study participants (SP) over a 12-weeks period, including a group receiving standard care (15 MG patients) and a group with additional telemedical treatment (30 MG patients) including assessment of PROMs, wearable data collection and telemedical check-ups. Questions regarding care-related aspects were assessed at baseline visit. Results: Many SP (N=33, 73.3%) communicate with the physician managing their MG via email. 73.3% (N=33) of SP identify areas for improvement in their MG care including symptom monitoring (N=23, 69.7%), specialist appointment availability (N=22, 66.7%), medication (N=22, 66.7%) and specialist accessibility (N=20, 60.6%). Additionally, 73.3% (N=33) reported that the effort required to manage their MG was high. Conclusion: Our results emphasize the high demand of affected MG patients for continuous telemedicine services. MyaLink can provide such a service through personalized support based on the exchange of health data. Telemedicine solutions such as MyaLink promise to improve myasthenia care by providing accessible, patient-centred care that enables early detection of worsening symptoms and non-response to treatment."

Technological advancements, particularly in commercially available Active Assisted Living devices, offer a promising alternative. These readily accessible products, ranging from smartwatches to home automation systems, are often equipped with Artificial Intelligence capabilities that can monitor health metrics, predict adverse events, and facilitate a safer living environment. However, there is no review exploring how Artificial Intelligence has been integrated into commercially available Active Assisted Living technologies, and how these devices monitor health metrics and provide healthcare solutions in a real-world environment for healthy aging. This review is essential because it fills a knowledge gap in understanding AI's integration in Active Assisted Living technologies in promoting healthy aging in real-world settings, identifying key issues that require to be addressed in future studies. Objective: The aim of this overview is to outline current understanding, identify potential research opportunities, and highlight research gaps from published studies regarding the use of Artificial Intelligence in commercially available Active Assisted Living technologies that assists older individuals aging at home. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted in six databases—PubMed, CINAHL, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, ACM Digital Library, and Web of Science—to identify relevant studies published over the past decade from 2013 to 2024. Our methodology adhered to the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews to ensure rigor and transparency throughout the review process. After applying predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria on 825 retrieved articles, a total of 64 papers were included for analysis and synthesis. Results: Several trends emerged from our analysis of the 64 selected papers. A majority of the work (39/64, 61%) was published after the year 2020. Geographically, most of the studies originated from East Asia and North America (36/64, 56%). The primary application goal of Artificial Intelligence in the reviewed literature was focused on activity recognition (34/64, 53%), followed by daily monitoring (10/64, 16%). Methodologically, tree-based and neural network-based approaches were the most prevalent Artificial Intelligence algorithms used in studies (32/64, 50% and 31/64, 48% respectively). A notable proportion of the studies (32/64, 50%) carried out their research using specially designed smart home testbeds that simulate the conditions in real-world. Moreover, ambient technology was a common thread (49/64, 77%), with occupancy-related data (such as motion and electrical appliance usage logs) and environmental sensors (indicators like temperature and humidity) being the most frequently used. Conclusion: Our results suggest that Artificial Intelligence has been increasingly deployed in the real-world Active Assisted Living context over the past decade, offering a variety of applications aimed at healthy aging and facilitating independent living for the older adults. A wide range of smart home indicators were leveraged for comprehensive data analysis, exploring and enhancing the potentials and effectiveness of solutions. However, our review has identified multiple research gaps that need further investigation. First, most research has been conducted in controlled testbed environments, leaving a lack of real-world applications that could validate the technologies' efficacy and scalability. Second, there is a noticeable absence of research leveraging cloud technology, an essential tool for large-scale deployment and standardized data collection and management.

LIG can be easily produced by single-step laser scribing at normal room temperature and pressure using easily accessible commercial level laser machines and materials. With the increasing demand for novel wearable devices for biomedical applications, LIG on flexible substrates can readily serve as a technological platform to be further developed for biomedical applications such as point-of-care (POC) testing and wearable devices for healthcare monitoring system. This review will provide a comprehensive grounding on LIG from its inception and fabrication mechanism to the characterization of its key functional properties. The exploration of biomedicals applications in the form of wearable and point-of-care devices will then be presented. Issue of health risk from accidental exposure to LIG will be covered. Then LIG-based wearable devices will be compared to devices of different materials.

However, to our knowledge, limited information is available regarding RPM use in geriatric psychiatry patients. Methods: In concert with the RPM Workgroup of Northwell Health, a quality improvement (QI) initiative was launched to explore RPM feasibility in geriatric psychiatry outpatients. Wearable and non-wearable devices were selected. Geriatric psychiatrists referred appropriate patients from the Geriatric Psychiatry Clinic at Zucker Hillside Hospital in Queens, NY. Explanation/introduction of devices were made to patients, and agreement to participate achieved. The following devices were utilized. The “biobutton’ is a half-dollar sized wearable device that affixes to the chest, and measures heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), sleep and activity. It passively collects data and then intermittently communicates to a nearby relay device which in turn transfers the data to the cloud. An intermediary health technology company then translates the data into a user-friendly dashboard that can be accessed by clinical providers through a portal. Ten patients were recruited for this pilot. The non-wearable devices employed were a blood pressure (BP) cuff and a weight scale with built-in SIM card-based connectivity that enables instant data transmission to a cloud-based clinician dashboard. These devices were demonstrated for patients to ensure familiarity with activation. Both devices were then sent to patients’ homes. Fifteen patients participated. Patients were provided with 24-hour phone support for potential glitches and concerns. Continued participation was based on the integrity of data flow and regular patient follow-ups. At the completion of each program, multi-parameter feasibility/satisfaction surveys (Likert-like 5 point scales; 1 = least favorable, 5 = most favorable) were administered to patients and geriatric psychiatrist providers. Results: Wearable/passive RPM (biobutton): The average scores over all survey questions were respectively 4.7 and 4.0 for patients and providers. Detailed participants’ ratings were: general satisfaction (4.7), satisfaction with the enrollment process (5), satisfaction with device maintenance (4.3), satisfaction with support (5), ease of use (5), interest to continue use (4.2), and recommending to others (4.5). Detailed providers’ ratings were: general satisfaction (3.8), satisfaction with enrollment process (4.8), accessibility of recorded data (4), satisfaction with support during pilot (4.6), clinical utility (3.8), interest to continue use (3.6), recommending to other patients (3.6) and to colleagues (4). Non-wearable/active RPM (BP cuff/weight scale): The average scores over all survey questions were respectively 4.6 and 4.5 for patients and providers. Detailed participants’ ratings were: general satisfaction (4.7), satisfaction with the enrollment process (4.8), satisfaction with device use (4.9), satisfaction with support (4.2), ease of use (4.3), interest to continue use (4.7), and recommending to others (4.9). Detailed providers’ ratings were: general satisfaction (4.5), satisfaction with enrollment process (4.5), accessibility of recorded data (4), satisfaction with support during pilot (4.5), clinical utility (5), interest to continue use (4.5), recommending to other patients (4.5) and to colleagues (4.5).In addition, preliminary qualitative feedback reported regularly encountered glitches with biobutton placement (e.g. inconsistent adhesion of biobutton to chest), consistency of data flow to relay device, and missing expected data points. In contrast, other than the single-size BP cuff being too small for one patient, no other problems were reported using the non-wearable devices. Conclusions: Wearable and non-wearable RPM devices can be successfully applied and utilized in populations of geriatric psychiatry outpatients. Although only a small number of collective patients (n = 25) participated, different age and diagnostic groups were represented, including, e.g., patients who were very old or demented. Overall, patients rated RPM feasibility ‘metrics’ higher than providers. Providers rated overall clinical utility of the biobutton as less meaningful than BP and weight recordings, however further inquiry may reveal differences for individual biobutton parameters (i.e. HR, RR, sleep, activity). Multiple-component RPM had greater challenges and less provider satisfaction, suggesting that device simplicity is especially relevant in this population."

Objectives: To systematically review published literature and classify smartphone and tablet apps with objective measurement capabilities for the diagnosis, monitoring, assessment, or treatment of movement disorders. Methods: We systematically searched for publications covering smartphone or tablet apps to monitor movement disorders until November 22nd 2023. We reviewed the target population, measured domains, purpose, and technology readiness level (TRL) of the proposed app and checked their availability in common app stores. Results: We identified 113 apps. Most apps were developed for Parkinson's disease specifically (n = 82; 73%) or for movement disorders in general (n = 17; 15%). Apps were either designed to momentarily assess symptoms (n = 65; 58%), support treatment (n = 22; 19%), aid in diagnosis (n = 16; 14%), or passively track symptoms (n = 11; 10%). Commonly assessed domains across movement disorders included fine motor skills (n = 34; 30%), gait (n = 36; 32%), and tremor (n = 32; 28%) for the motor domain and cognition (n = 16; 14%) for the non-motor domain. Twenty-six (23%) apps were proof-of-concepts (TRL 1–3), while most apps were tested in a controlled setting (TRL 4–6; n = 63; 56%). Twenty-four apps were tested in their target setting (TRL 7–9) of which 10 were accessible in common app stores or as Android Package. Conclusions: The development of apps strongly gravitates towards Parkinson's disease and a selection of motor symptoms.

This article presents a novel architecture that integrates PUF, blockchain, and Tangle for Security-by-Design (SbD) of healthcare cyber-physical systems (H-CPSs). Healthcare systems around the world have undergone massive technological transformation and have seen growing adoption with the advancement of Internet-of-Medical Things (IoMT). The technological transformation of healthcare systems to telemedicine, e-health, connected health, and remote health is being made possible with the sophisticated integration of IoMT with machine learning, big data, artificial intelligence (AI), and other technologies. As healthcare systems are becoming more accessible and advanced, security and privacy have become pivotal for the smooth integration and functioning of various systems in H-CPSs. In this work, we present a novel approach that integrates PUF with IOTA Tangle and blockchain and works by storing the PUF keys of a patient's Body Area Network (BAN) inside blockchain to access, store, and share globally. Each patient has a network of smart wearables and a gateway to obtain the physiological sensor data securely. To facilitate communication among various stakeholders in healthcare systems, IOTA Tangle's Masked Authentication Messaging (MAM) communication protocol has been used, which securely enables patients to communicate, share, and store data on Tangle. The MAM channel works in the restricted mode in the proposed architecture, which can be accessed using the patient's gateway PUF key. Furthermore, the successful verification of PUF enables patients to securely send and share physiological sensor data from various wearable and implantable medical devices embedded with PUF. Finally, healthcare system entities like physicians, hospital admin networks, and remote monitoring systems can securely establish communication with patients using MAM and retrieve the patient's BAN PUF keys from the blockchain securely. Our experimental analysis shows that the proposed approach successfully integrates three security primitives, PUF, blockchain, and Tangle, providing decentralized access control and security in H-CPS with minimal energy requirements, data storage, and response time."

Mobile health (mHealth) and computer-based technologies are used for rehabilitation and remote monitoring. The extent of technology use and its function in post-knee replacement rehabilitation care in low and middle-income settings are unknown. OBJECTIVE: To inform future mHealth intervention development, we conducted a scoping review to map the features and functionality of existing technologies and determine users' perspectives on telerehabilitation and technology for self-management. METHODS: We followed the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for scoping reviews. We searched the Embase, Medline, PsycINFO via OVID, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases for manuscripts published from 2001 onward. We included original research articles reporting the use of mobile or computer-based technologies by patients, health care providers, researchers, or family members. Studies were divided into the following 3 categories based on the purpose: validation studies, clinical evaluation, and end user feedback. We extracted general information on study design, technology features, proposed function, and perspectives of health care providers and patients. The protocol for this review is accessible in the Open Science Framework. RESULTS: Of the 5960 articles, 158 that reported from high-income settings contributed to the qualitative summary (64 studies on mHealth or telerehabilitation programs, 28 validation studies, 38 studies describing users' perceptions). The highest numbers of studies were from Europe or the United Kingdom and North America regarding the use of a mobile app with or without wearables and reported mainly in the last decade. No studies were from low and middle-income settings. The primary functions of technology for remote rehabilitation were education to aid recovery and enable regular, appropriate exercises; monitoring progress of pain (n=19), activity (n=20), and exercise adherence (n=30); 1 or 2-way communication with health care professionals to facilitate the continuum of care (n=51); and goal setting (n=23). Assessment of range of motion (n=16) and gait analysis (n=10) were the commonly validated technologies developed to incorporate into a future rehabilitation program. Few studies (n=14) reported end user involvement during the development stage. We summarized the reasons for satisfaction and dissatisfaction among users across various technologies. CONCLUSIONS: Several existing mobile and computer-based technologies facilitate post-knee replacement rehabilitation care for patients and health care providers. However, they are limited to high-income settings and may not be extrapolated to low-income settings. A systematic needs assessment of patients undergoing knee replacement and health care providers involved in rehabilitation, involving end users at all stages of development and evaluation, with clear reporting of the development and clinical evaluation can make post-knee replacement rehabilitation care in resource-poor settings accessible and cost-effective."

Despite the immense potential for rehabilitation and exercise to help people with disabilities live longer, healthier, and more independent lives, people with disabilities can experience physical, psychosocial, environmental, and economic barriers that limit their ability to participate in rehabilitation, exercise, and other physical activities. Together, these barriers contribute to health inequities in people with disabilities, by disproportionately limiting their ability to participate in health-promoting physical activities, relative to people without disabilities. Therefore, there is great need for research and innovation focusing on the development of strategies to expand accessibility and promote participation in rehabilitation and exercise programs for people with disabilities.

Despite the life-saving potential of LVADs, post-implantation patient management remains challenging, with complications such as infections, device malfunctions, and thrombosis being common. Remote patient monitoring (RPM) systems have shown promising results in improving patient outcomes across various healthcare scenarios. Objective: We aimed to describe the characteristics and outcomes of LVAD patients using remote monitoring system. Method: Patients receiving an LVAD, have been followed by the Satelia® solution, a HF management solution with a remote monitoring system. The system is accessible from any devices, requiring no software installation, no external sensors. This study was conducted in 10 centers in France. Results: This study analyzed a population of 187 patients, predominantly male (81%), with a mean age of 62 years, who underwent LVAD implantation. The majority of the patients had the HM3 type of LVAD (74%) and were treated as a Bridge to transplantation (60%). The main etiology of heart failure in these patients was ischemic in nature (75%) with a mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 23%. Over the course of 17 months (7 days-39 months), patients answered 13,644 questionnaires, resulting in 1,613 red alerts (12%) that were communicated to their cardiologists. The monitoring was primarily discontinued due to death (27%), patient or healthcare professional decision (39%), or other reasons (34%). Additional data regarding the description of the population and the alerts and their resolutions will be presented at the congress. Conclusion: In conclusion, these data may potentially improve patient outcomes by identifying critical alerts in LVAD patients, enabling timely interventions and informing future management strategies in this population."

However, assessments of postural instability, known as postural sway, leverage force platforms or wearable accelerometers, and are most often conducted in laboratory environments and are thus not broadly accessible. Remote measures of postural sway captured during daily life may provide a more accessible alterative, but their ability to capture disease status and fall risk has not yet been established. We explored the utility of remote measures of postural sway in a sample of 33 PwMS. Remote measures of sway differed significantly from lab-based measures, but still demonstrated moderately strong associations with patient-reported measures of balance and mobility impairment. Machine learning models for predicting fall risk trained on lab data provided an Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.79, while remote data only achieved an AUC of 0.51. Remote model performance improved to an AUC of 0.74 after a new, subject-specific k-means clustering approach was applied for identifying the remote data most appropriate for modelling. This cluster-based approach for analyzing remote data also strengthened associations with patient-reported measures, increasing their strength above those observed in the lab. This work introduces a new framework for analyzing data from remote patient monitoring technologies and demonstrates the promise of remote postural sway assessment for assessing fall risk and characterizing balance impairment in PwMS."

Cardio-oncology rehabilitation (CORE) is an emerging treatment model to optimize the prognosis of hematological cancer patients and survivors; however, its accessibility during the COVID-19 pandemic is poor. The study aimed to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and effect of a 12-week home-based CORE intervention in telerehabilitation approach among hematological cancer survivors. Methods: A prospective single-arm interventional study was conducted at a faculty hospital in Brno, Czech Republic. This study provided 12 weeks of the home-based CORE using a telerehabilitation approach that allows remote supervision by a clinician from a medical facility. The telerehabilitation approach consists of three components: a heart rate sensor (PolarM430, Kempele, Finland), a web platform compatible with the sensor, and telesupervising via telephone call (1 call per week). To improve adherence, a physiotherapist called participants to assess or address adverse effects, exercise feedback, and participant-related concerns. The anthropometry, body composition, and cardiorespiratory fitness were measured immediately after the intervention. Results: Eleven hematological cancer survivors with an average age of 60.3 ± 10 years participated in the study. Most participants were diagnosed with Follicular lymphoma and received maintenance treatment. Participants had a significant (p < 0.05) increase in cardiorespiratory fitness by 2.6 ml/kg/min; and in peak workload, from 143.3 ± 60.6 W to 158.6 ± 67.5 W (p < 0.05). Improvement in anthropometry and body composition was observed but yielded no statistical significance. Most (80%) participants completed the three times/per week telesupervising exercise session for 12 weeks.No adverse event was identified. Conclusion: Findings from this study suggest that home-based CORE may provide hematological cancer survivors with an increase in CRF during the rehabilitation period after hospital discharge. The telerehabilitation CORE model is effective, feasible, safe, and has demonstrated good adherence. Further randomized controlled efficacy study with larger sample size is needed before clinical implementation.

Patients with severe COVID-19 require various equipment, such as ventilators, infusion pumps, and patient monitors, and a dedicated medical team to operate and monitor the equipment in isolated intensive care units (ICUs). Medical staff must wear personal protective equipment to reduce the risk of infection. This study proposes a tele-monitoring system for isolation ICUs to assist in the monitoring of COVID-19 patients. The tele-monitoring system consists of three parts: medical-device panel image processing, transmission, and tele-monitoring. This system can monitor the ventilator screen with obstacles, receive and store data, and provide real-time monitoring and data analysis. The proposed tele-monitoring system is compared with previous studies, and the image combination algorithm for reconstruction is evaluated using structural similarity index (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). The system achieves an SSIM score of 0.948 in the left side and a PSNR of 23.414 dB in the right side with no obstacles. It also reduces blind spots, with an SSIM score of 0.901 and a PSNR score of 18.13 dB. The proposed tele-monitoring system is compatible with both wired and wireless communication, making it accessible in various situations. It uses camera and performs live data monitoring, and the two monitoring systems complement each other. The system also includes a comprehensive database and an analysis tool, allowing medical staff to collect and analyze data on ventilator use, providing them a quick, at-a-glance view of the patient's condition. With the implementation of this system, patient outcomes may be improved and the burden on medical professionals may be reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic-like situations."

BCRL can significantly reduce the quality of life (QOL) of patients and poses a significant challenge to healthcare providers. Early detection and continuous monitoring of lymphedema is crucial for the development of client-centered treatment plans for post-cancer surgery patients. Therefore, this comprehensive scoping review aimed to investigate the current technology methods used for the remote monitoring of BCRL and their potential to facilitate telehealth in the treatment of lymphedema. Initially, five electronic databases were systematically searched and analyzed following the PRISMA flow diagram. Studies were included, specifically if they provided data on the effectiveness of the intervention and were designed for the remote monitoring of BCRL. A total of 25 included studies reported 18 technological solutions to remotely monitor BCRL with significant methodological variation. Additionally, the technologies were categorized by method of detection and wearability. The findings of this comprehensive scoping review indicate that state-of-the-art commercial technologies were found to be more appropriate for clinical use than home monitoring, with portable 3D imaging tools being popular (SD 53.40) and accurate (correlation > 0.9, p < 0.05) for evaluating lymphedema in both clinic and home settings with expert practitioners and therapists. However, wearable technologies showed the most future potential for accessible and clinical long-term lymphedema management with positive telehealth outcomes. In conclusion, the absence of a viable telehealth device highlights the need for urgent research to develop a wearable device that can effectively track BCRL and facilitate remote monitoring, ultimately improving the quality of life for patients following post-cancer treatment."

This study aimed to explore an approach to assess quality of life in patients with SCD through a remote monitoring ecosystem accessible from patients' own homes, and with this, what potential impact such tracking may have upon patient wellbeing. Methods: The patient ecosystem provided a clinically validated wearable for live remote monitoring of metrics (e.g., activity, sleep, and heart rate); a digital portal for input of patient-reported outcomes (PROs); and a digital platform of live and retrospective insights, healthcare timelines, and data entry - a 'digital patient wallet' - encapsulating their combined data, including medical records. Patients provided informed e-consent to participate and for analysis of their de-identified data, with no dropouts. Patients who had (1) participated for at least 5 months, (2) recorded a minimum of 5 EQ-5D scores across their first 30 days with the programme, and (3) recorded a minimum of 5 entries across the most recent 30 days were analysed (n=23). Percentage changes between the first and most recent 30-day average EQ-5D scores were calculated, to assess any potential changes since patients began utilising the ecosystem, as well as the statistical significance of any differences in EQ-5D between these timepoints. Results: In comparison to their initial 30-day average, 78% (18/23) of patients showed an overall increase in average EQ-5D score by their most recent 30-day period, with 35% (8/23) showing a statistically significant change (p<0.05). In contrast, 22% (5/23) of patients showed an overall decrease in EQ-5D, however, only 4% (1/23) recorded a statistically significant change. Early trends highlight a potential, albeit not statistically significant, emerging link between patient engagement rates with EQ-5D reporting (number of entries/days since first entry) and the percentage change in their EQ-5D score, with increasing engagement rates correlating with increasing percentage changes in EQ-5D score. Conclusions & Future Steps: This work provides an early look at the potential impacts consistent monitoring of PROs may have on patient wellbeing. While not necessarily a causal relationship, it highlights early indications that this form of PRO monitoring may be beneficial to patient outcomes, potentially through heightened engagement with patient self-reporting and therefore self-monitoring to support disease management and behavioural changes. However, such findings may also be influenced by factors including the wearable biometric monitoring component, health events patients may have experienced over this period, as well as differences in the time of year patients joined the programme - environmental factors and temperature known to impact patient wellbeing in SCD. A key goal will be to increase the period of longitudinal data collection for more in-depth comparison within a larger volume of patients. Future steps will incorporate direct causal analysis, investigate whether these changes are impacted by each individual's starting point, and explore any associated changes in patients' physical health - building a stronger understanding of patient outcomes and quality of life in SCD, and the approaches that can be taken to improve this."

However, collecting health information using conventional medical equipment at home or in a hospital can be inefficient and can potentially affect the timeliness of treatment. Therefore, on-time vital signal collection via healthcare monitoring has received increasing attention. As the largest organ of the human body, skin delivers significant signals reflecting our health condition; thus, receiving vital signals directly from the skin offers the opportunity for accessible and versatile non-invasive monitoring. In particular, emerging flexible and stretchable electronics demonstrate the capability of skin-like devices for on-time and continuous long-term health monitoring. Compared to traditional electronic devices, this type of device has better mechanical properties, such as skin conformal attachment, and maintains compatible detectability.

Additionally, the benefits of implementing technology applications in pain management, including its ability to broaden nurses’ knowledge, hone their decision-making skills, and customize patient care with the use of simulation platforms and remote monitoring tools, were identified. Furthermore, issues like technological literacy, time restraints, privacy concerns, and ethical considerations need to be addressed for the effective incorporation of technology into pain management procedures. Conclusion: To improve patient care and outcomes, nurses can use technology to improve their pain management skills by recognizing the possible benefits and resolving related problems. Conclusively, areas for future research and development and implications to nursing practice, education, and research were outlined."

These systems were developed using the latest technology in wireless sensors, medical devices, cloud computing, mobile computing, telecommunications, and machine learning technologies. In this article, a real-time remote patient monitoring system is proposed with an accessible, compact, accurate, and low-cost design. The implemented system is designed to an end-to-end communication interface between medical practitioners and patients. The objective of this study is to provide remote healthcare services to patients who need ongoing care or those who have been discharged from the hospital without affecting their daily routines. The developed monitoring system was then evaluated on 1177 records from MIMIC-III clinical dataset (aged between 19 and 99 years). The performance analysis of the proposed system achieved 88.7% accuracy in generating alerts with logistic regression classification algorithm. This result reflects positively on the quality and robustness of the proposed study. Since the processing time of the proposed system is less than 2 minutes, it can be stated that the system has a high computational speed and is convenient to use in real-time monitoring. Furthermore, the proposed system will fulfil to cover the lower doctor-to-patient ratio by monitoring patients from remote locations and aged people who reside in their residences."

In 2021, there were 2,080,917 human exposures reported to US poison centers with 93% occurring in a residence, and 67% managed on site. Home management could be increased and would be safer with knowledge of real time vital signs (VS). Abnormal VS often precede clinical deterioration and their early detection could allow for therapeutic intervention in the home setting to either allow a patient to remain at home or quickly identify the need to seek in person medical care. Patient convenience and healthcare cost savings are potential benefits of remote patient monitoring devices (RPMDs). The purpose of this study was to compare RPMD VS collection to in-hospital nursing VS collection for toxicologic exposures. Methods: This was a prospective, cohort study in a large, academic, urban hospital from 1 May 2021 to 31 December 2021. Admitted toxicology consultations were reviewed daily for eligibility. Patients > 18 years and able to consent were enrolled from non-intensive care settings. All participating patients had informational study flyers hung at bedside. Informed consent was obtained. This study was approved by the local Institutional Review Board. BioSticker™ is FDA approved for remote patient monitoring. Sensors transmit data via Bluetooth to a bedside hub device which streams participants' heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR) securely to a remotely accessible HIPAAcompliant web portal. Patients wore the device for the duration of their admission while also receiving routine VS checks by nurses. Nurses were blinded to device VS readings. Researchers accessed nurse-collected data from the electronic medical record. Device data was averaged over one hour and compared to corresponding nurse VS timestamps. Data was collected in Excel® and statistical analyses were performed. Device data consistency was assessed using the percentage of manual VS timepoints for which device VS data was retrievable. Device-collected and nurse-collected VS agreement was determined using the mean of the differences between corresponding VS pairs and Bland Altman plot. Results: Four patients were enrolled in the study. Mean patient age was 36.25 years, two were female, and devices were worn 12-48 hours among the four patients (1). Data collected by BioSticker™successfully streamed HR and RR for 97.0% of all nurse VS checks. Two patients experienced bradycardia and two patients experienced tachypnea (1). The mean differences between nurse and device values for HR and RR were -4.2 bpm and 2.3 rpm, respectively. There were 18 VS abnormalities (17 HR and 2 RR) detected by nursing VS collection and 26 by BioSticker™ (25 HR and 1 RR). Bland Altman plots display generally consistent agreement across the range of measurement. Conclusions: BioSticker™ demonstrated overall concordance in VS collection with hospital nursing and reliability. While the sample size was small, the potential for the use of RMPDs is demonstrated in the fidelity of VS collection, relatively low mean differences and Bland Altman concordance. Future, larger studies, including with patient experience surveys, are needed."

The case of an improved remote monitoring system with interactive communication function,English,"Introduction: Do assistive technologies (AT) enhance QoL of older people and care professionals in long-term care facilities? We have previously reported on the impact of using a monitoring system with an infrared camera and communication robots (Obayashi et al. 2020). Further improvements were made to the detection accuracy of the camera, and functionalities for verbal interaction were added. This paper reports on these efforts in nursing homes, and their impact on the ground. Methods: The study was conducted with 34 older people and 20 care professionals in nursing homes. An infrared sensor and a biosensor were installed on the ceiling of each resident's room. When the camera detects movement by the resident, it notifies the care staff via the mobile terminal. Its detection accuracy was improved against sunlight and physical obstacles. A variety of qualitative and quantitative data (e.g. sleeping patterns and social participation of older people, system usability and staff task analysis) were collected before and after installation. Communication functions were added to the system. Results: False detection rates of the monitoring camera decreased significantly. Using the improved system for the duration of 34 days, 602 alerts were recorded in total and 430 staff visits to rooms during night shifts were spared. The task analysis revealed that time available for direct caregiving increased (e.g. direct communication: From 2 to 55 min), while indirect care activities decreased. After the introduction of communicative functions, system usability decreased, primarily due to inaudibility. However, the qualitative data support the idea of an interactive system. Key conclusions: Faced with the challenge of meeting increasing demand for person-centered care under limited resources, there will be a greater need for better integration of improved AT. The study indicates AT's potential for enhancing the quality of care for all."

Since these devices have an extremely specific application, their accessibility can become complex when applied to bedridden people, because of their positioning but also due to the clothing they use, which normally does not have the ideal conditions of design and type of textile (i.e., minimal flexibility, reduced openings). Method: This study comprised an approach based on the evaluation of a textile prototype designed (under the project 4NoPressure) to prevent the occurrence of pressure injuries for the evaluation of an innovative device through a focus group with 19 experts, health professionals with experience in the area of care and how garments may or may not facilitate the performance of health professionals in handling devices on the people themselves or even in accessing and monitoring vascular access. Results: After an analysis carried out by a group of experts, new materials with a specific design promotes thermophysiological control of the skin's microclimate. It was verified that clothing in the form of 2-piece pajamas should be easy to handle with a practical opening system, in the central region or sleeves for easy access to medical devices (i.e., puncture, placement of external fasteners, among others), as well as for their monitoring and avoiding side seams that can promote pressure sore formation. Discussion & Conclusion: In this way, it verified and encouraged the need to establish more multidisciplinary teams aimed at the development of new products not only innovative but also with preventive action to respond to some existing gaps in the market in the health sector."

To date, there is limited information available regarding patient preferences for remote digital technology use. Objectives: To capture the patient's attitude toward remote monitoring of MND in care and clinical trials, and their concerns and preferences regarding the use of digital technology. Methods: We performed an international multi-center survey study in three MND clinics in The Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Australia. The survey was co-developed by investigators and patients with MND, and sent to patients by e-mail or postal-mail. The main topics included: patients' attitude toward remote care, participating in decentralized clinical trials, and preferences for and concerns with digital technology use. Results: In total, 332 patients with MND participated. A majority of patients indicated they would be happy to selfmonitor their health from home (69%), be remotely monitored by a multidisciplinary care team (75%), and would be willing to participate in clinical trials from home (65%). Patients considered respiratory function and muscle strength most valuable for home-monitoring. The majority of patients considered the use of at least three devices/apps (75%) once a week (61%) to be acceptable for home-monitoring. Fifteen percent of patients indicated they would not wish to perform home-measurements; they reported concerns about the burden and distress of home-monitoring, privacy and data security. Conclusion: Most patients with MND exhibited a positive attitude toward the use of digital technology in both care and clinical trial settings. A subgroup of patients reported concerns with home-monitoring, which should be addressed in order to improve widespread adoption of remote digital technology in clinical MND care."

We firmly believe that symptom-toballoon time should prove a better focus to this end. Challenges come with this goal as it heavily relies on a patient's perception and initiative to seek care, which we deem intelligent and wearable Artificial Intelligence (AI)- driven Single Lead EKG technologies as an attractive solution in modernday cardiology. Purpose: To provide an accurate, accessible, and cost-effective AI-driven Single Lead STEMI detection algorithm that can be embedded into wearable devices and employed in a self-administered fashion. Methods: Database: EKG records from Mexico, Colombia, Argentina, and Brazil from April 2014 to December 2019. Dataset: A total of 11,567 12- lead EKG records of 10[s] length with a sampling frequency of 500 Hz, including the following balanced classes: Angiographically confirmed and unconfirmed STEMI, branch blocks, non-specific ST-T abnormalities, normal and abnormal (200+ CPT codes, excluding those mentioned above). Cardiologists manually checked the label of each record to ensure precision. Pre-processing: We discard the first and last 250 samples as they may contain a standardisation pulse. The study applied a digital low pass filter of order 5 with a frequency cut-off of 35 Hz. The mean was subtracted from each Lead. Classification: The determined classes were STEMI (Including STEMI in different locations of the myocardium - anterior, inferior, and lateral); and Not-STEMI (Combination of randomly sample, branch blocks, non-specific ST-T changes, and abnormal records - 25% of each). Training and Testing: A 1-D Convolutional Neural Network was trained and tested with a dataset proportion of 90/10, respectively. A different model was trained and tested for each Lead, using the central 4,500 samples of the records. The last dense layer outputs a probability for each report of being STEMI or Not-STEMI. Lead V2 showed the best overall results. The model was further tested through the same methodology using the best Lead with a subset of the previous data, excluding the unconfirmed STEMI EKG records (Total 7,230 12-lead EKG records for Confirmed Only STEMI dataset). Performance metrics were reported for each experiment and compared. Results: Combined STEMI data: Accuracy: 91.2%; Sensitivity: 89.6%; Specificity: 92.9%. Confirmed STEMI Only dataset: Accuracy: 92.4%; Sensitivity: 93.4%; Specificity: 91.4% (Figure 1). Conclusion: By assiduously improving the quality of the model's input, we continue to assess our algorithm's performance and reliability for future clinical validation as a potential remote monitoring and early STEMI detection device."

Methods: Nationally representative survey of Australian parents, recruited via an online panel in February 2021 as part of the Royal Children's Hospital National Child Health Poll. Participants were randomly selected from the consumer panel. Results: 1981 (59.4% response rate) parents completed the survey. 39.9% were aware of virtual health care, defined by digital technology and medical devices to support remote monitoring. Higher levels of awareness were associated with being male, having previous teleconsultation experience, higher education attainment and employment. Most parents reported an appetite for asynchronous communication using an app or website to either provide information prior to a consult (65.9%), provide a photo of a rash or similar (61.7%) or receive medical advice (58.1%). Appetite for wearable devices was similar at 59.9%. Conclusions: Whilst awareness of virtual healthcare was low, appetite exists amongst Australian parents to use technology to support their child's health care. Health-care models, which incorporate asynchronous communication or symptom monitoring through apps, are likely to be acceptable and offer an accessible and sustainable alternative to traditional face-to-face health care."

The Strados Labs Remote Electronic Stethoscope Platform (RESPTM) is the first and only device that offers the clinical staff access to the patient remotely with a wearable device, adhered to the chest wall and designed to capture all lung sounds and transmit them through AWS or SD card retrieval for annotation, interpretation recording and uploading to a clinician accessible portal. METHODS: Volunteers with cardiopulmonary diseases were recruited from the patient population. The placement of the device was based on auscultation of the chest and identification of the optimal site for capturing diffuse lung sounds, including rales, rhonchi, wheezes, cough and intrathoracic sounds not otherwise specified. These studies compared direct auscultation at 4 sites on the chest with adjacent recording using the Littmann3200® stethoscope, followed by removal of 2 RESPTM wearables and finally one wearable, creating a 4:2:1 paradigm. Acoustic recordings were then compared by at least 3 board certified clinicians masked to patient diagnosis and chest wall placement. Some volunteers were asked to cough, swallow, perform a “glottal stop,” count, and breathe deeply at rest and while ambient noise (music) played. Respiratory rate was independently captured using chest wall motion sensing. RESULTS: 10 patients participated in the first study, with no dropouts. The RESPTM provided high fidelity data access substantially similar to the Littmann3200 across a range of patients (COPD, asthma, CHF, chronic cough), with no loss of accuracy or fidelity decreasing from 4 devices to 1. All sounds have been archived. In the second study, the RESPTM was affixed to patients with chronic cough for 8 hours of continuous recording. Together with data from other patients, the RESPTM system was validated for cough counting and provided unique insights into cough architecture and intrathoracic versus extra-thoracic cough origin. CONCLUSION: rigorous testing is required to validate the utility of a remote device to capture and annotate lung sounds. Strados Labs has validated the utility and robustness of the RESPTM in studies designed to stress test the system and to provide the basis for algorithm development and improved nurse: physician collaboration."

Interestingly, no review of attitudes toward telemedicine among older adults has been performed. This is likely to be the group most affected by both cancer and the increasing use of technology in health care. Objective: We aimed to map research on the acceptance of telemedicine among older adults who are cancer patients. Methods: We conducted a scoping review. PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were systematically searched from inception to September 2020. Articles were included if the study population had a mean or median age ≥65 years, with cancer diagnoses and if the study assessed patients’ acceptance of a telemedicine intervention. Quantitative, qualitative, and mixed method studies were included. Results: Out of a total of 887 articles that were identified, 19 were included in the review. Interventions were delivered via telephone, videoconference, web portal, mobile app, wearable technology, and text messaging and included teleconsultation, monitoring and follow-up, psychosocial support and nursing care, and prompts. The most often cited facilitating factor was convenience. Other facilitators included an increase in telemedicine care accessibility, previous positive experiences of telemedicine, appropriate technical knowledge and support, decreased cost, physician recommendations, and privacy conferred by the telemedicine intervention. Barriers include a preference for conventional care along with negative perceptions of telemedicine, concerns about technical difficulties, and confidentiality concerns in the adoption of telemedicine. Conclusions: None of the studies explored the ability of tailored interventions to address facilitators and barriers of the acceptance of telemedicine in order to increase its adoption by older adults. Facilitators and barriers will likely differ across different cultural contexts and by type of telemedicine; however, this is a gap in current knowledge. In-depth studies are necessary to determine if interventions could potentially address the barriers identified in this review, to increase acceptability."

These tools walk a fine line between lifestyle consumer products and medical devices. Sleep applications can be used by consumers as a fun gadget to track sleep, but it may also be used as a medical tool to collect information concerning serious sleep disorders. The fast proliferation of these tools has put pressure on concerned stakeholders to make sense of this group of technologies. Various questions have been raised within this realm: What counts as medical as opposed to a lifestyle device? Which devices require regulation and under what standards? Which devices are allowed to be used in the medical context? And which are not? And under what conditions? Social scientists have highlighted the complexity of digital health tools that (include both medical and lifestyle characteristics and the difficulties accompanied with classifying these tools for regulatory purposes. In an attempt to do so, several regulatory bodies including the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have revised their existing standards to accommodate the regulation of digital health tools. As such, the FDA published a guidance document on Mobile Medical Applications; this led to various concerns questioning the boundaries between lifestyle and medical digital technologies that were defined by the FDA guidelines, which left a significant number of technologies that were considered to be low-risk, completely out of the FDA oversight and with no required compliance/quality control/effectiveness checks. This prompted many companies to develop hundreds of products that belong to the low-risk category, granting them the ability to ignore FDA regulations. Consequently, there remains considerable concern regarding the quality and safety of these digital health technologies that are being used within the medical context. Clear and well-defined regulation processes are needed to control the development and design of these tools, especially that many lack scientific evidence and data privacy. The framework ought to include a risk-based approach to classify devices for regulation in a way to ensure the safety and effectiveness of all digital health tools throughout their life cycle, even those classified as low-risk. The framework and regulatory process also need to take into consideration the rapid change in digital product development, as processes that extend for a long period of time may become obsolete in supporting decisions about these tools. As these digital health tools become more sophisticated, accessible, widespread, and cheaper, the need for classifying and regulating the sector becomes important, especially with the rapid evolution of these technologies."

Methods: Utilizing PRISMA guidelines, a literature search was conducted using the search terms “asthma,” “artificial intelligence,” “PGHD,” “exacerbations,” “prognosis,” and related terms. The search for this scoping review was conducted on PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Science, and EMBASE. Inclusion criteria consisted of articles published from January 2011 onwards and written in English. Duplicates were removed and review papers, abstracts, presentations, and grey literature were excluded. Results: The literature search yielded 377 articles. A preliminary review was conducted based on inclusion criteria, resulting in 15 articles. The top three variables for PGHD included vital sign monitoring via wearables (7 articles), patient-reported symptomatology (6 articles), and an element of pulmonary function testing (6 articles). Demographics and environmental exposures were each reported in 2 articles. Various forms of AI were used, the most common being random forest classifiers (6 articles). Conclusions: Existing literature has demonstrated that the utilization of PGHD in combination with AI promotes the adoption of precision medicine in asthma management. Given the heterogeneity of asthma, the ability to compute and relay real-time data to the patient and the provider can aid in the prediction and management of asthma exacerbations, but more data on demographics and environmental exposures should be considered to improve individualized prognostics."

Methods: The KP management system was embedded using hypertext markup language (HTML) code directly into the EHR. Encrypted credentials and patient data were bundled with an application programming interface key allowing linkage of remote monitoring from patients’ smartphones. During the time of implementation, a total of 322 patients and 32 179 ECGs were recorded. Results: The KP-EHR interface provided full functionality, allowing detection, interpretation and documentation of atrial fibrillation (AF), flutter events, ventricular tachycardia, and complete heart block. Our study focused on KP’s detection of AF, and 16.7% of tracings were classified as probable AF with only 2.3% of tracings not analyzed by the KP algorithm because of tracings that were too noisy or truncated. Enhanced management was facilitated with clinical information immediately accessible. Blinded physician ECG review validated the KP proprietary algorithm interpretation and ECGs. Conclusions: Direct integration of KP into EHR was successful and practical. It allows for historical, point of care and immediate retrieval of remote ambulatory monitoring data and documentation into the electronic health record.

The importance of new technologies and applications developed to provide crucial information to clinicians, to better manage HF patients. Expert opinion: New medical technologies and smartphone applications for CIEDs’ RM were developed to help clinicians in the management of CIED carriers. Indeed, the accessibility of technological devices (e.g. smartphones) and the improvements in medical technology provide the opportunity to optimize HF patients’ monitoring by the transmission of device-related data, and with direct involvement of patients themselves. Thanks to these advancements, physicians have the possibility to recognize worsening signs of HF and promptly optimize treatments to potentially avoid hospitalization. The great value of this approach is its potential of reducing scheduled in-office visits or unnecessary medical contacts and optimizing healthcare resources management."

Chronic illnesses such as diabetes, heart disease (HD), cancer, and chronic respiratory disease are the main causes of death worldwide. The previous 10 years have seen a lot of research into healthcare services and their technology advancements. To be more specific, the Internet of Things (IoT) has showed promise in connecting a variety of medical devices, sensors, and healthcare specialists in order to provide high-quality medical treatment in a remote place. Patient safety has improved, healthcare expenses have decreased, healthcare services have become more accessible, and the healthcare industry's operational efficiency has increased. In this paper, a diabetic patient monitoring strategy is proposed that uses an IoT-based machine learning technique called eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) to support in diabetes diagnosis and classification. A successful implementation of any classifier requires proper hyperparameter optimization. This work employed Bayesian optimization, which is a very effective method for hyper-parameter optimization, to optimize the hyper-parameters of XGBoost. The efficacy of the suggested method is assessed in terms of accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and F1score. It outperforms better than the other existing algorithms."

Seismocardiogram (SCG) is now easily accessible owing to the advance of wearable sensor technology. However, SCG biometric has not been widely explored due to the challenging motion artifact removal. In this paper, we design placing the sensors at different body parts under different activities to determine the best sensor location. In addition, we develop SCG noise removal algorithm and utilize machine learning approach to perform biometric authentication tasks. We validate the proposed methods on 20 healthy young adults. The dataset contains acceleration data of sitting, standing, walking, and sitting post-exercise activities with the sensor placed at the wrists, neck, heart and sternum. We demonstrate that vertical and dorsal-ventral SCG near the heart and the sternum produce reliable SCG biometric evidenced by achieving the state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, we present the efficacy of the devised noise removal procedure in the authentication during walking motion.Clinical relevance- A seismocardiography-based biometric authentication system can help serve privacy preserving and reveal cardiovascular functioning information in clinics."

To address this limitation, we developed an Apple Watch based app to enable patients to perform daily six minute walk tests (6MWT's) remotely. To test the app's utility and accuracy we are performing a single-center, feasibility trial enrolling participants with PAH on either stable or augmented PAH therapy (NCT03893500). Methods: All patients receiving care for PAH at Stanford Hospital meeting the study's inclusion and exclusion criteria and deemed good candidates by their PAH provider are approached to participate. Patients who consent are provided with an Apple Watch and instructed on loading the Walk.Talk.Track. App (WTT) and performing a 6MWT using the watch. Concurrent, in-clinic, supervised indoor and outdoor 6MWTs are performed at the baseline and 3-month follow up visits to assess app accuracy. De-identified data collected by the WTT app is transmitted to a secure cloud server, and is analyzed by the study team on a routine basis. Results: To date we have approached 75, and enrolled 29 PAH patients. These patients have 47 yrs median age, 83% female, with a broad range of WHO functional classes (31% I, 55% II, and 14% III). Participants have completed 814 6MWT's since study start, accounting for 210 patient-weeks of exposure (average 3.9 walks/week). The mean difference between WTT app measured distance and the observed gold standard was 8.54±102.2 meters indoor (N=24), and 67.34±68.7 meters for outdoor settings (N=21), respectively. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of WTT measured walks was 0.77. Technical limitations of the WTT app resulted in 18 walks being omitted from analysis, and an additional 16 walks not recorded (as reported by participants), with an overall device nonperformance rate of 4.2%. Only one, self-limited adverse event related to the study (contact dermatitis) was reported. There have been no reports of dyspnea, angina, or falls related to performing 6MWTs. Conclusion: The WTT app allows for accessible, frequent remote assessment of patient exercise tolerance that is reproducible (ICC 0.77), and can be performed by patients with a wide range of functional class without significant adverse effects. High temporal resolution of exercise tolerance has the potential to guide more rapid clinical decision making, and detect patient decompensation sooner. However, refinement through fusion of different watch sensor data is needed to improve accuracy."

The WCD provides additional heart failure parameters, like heart rate, step count and body position, accessible via remote monitoring. The purpose of this study was to evaluate clinical relevance of additionally recorded data in patients using the WCD. Methods: Patients with newly diagnosed heart failure and WCD, an average wear time with at least 20 hours per day and available heart failure parameters were included. The heart failure parameters were provided in 5-minute data intervals. An approximate for the heart rate variability was calculated via the standard deviation of the cycle length of the given heart rate per 5-minute data interval (HRV5). Results: 276 patients (68% male) were included between 04/2013 and 12/2017. Mean age was 57.4 ± 15.3 years. 174 patients (63%) suffered from non-ischemic and 102 patients (37%) from ischemic cardiomyopathy. Mean NYHA functional class at prescription was 2.6 ± 0.8. Mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 25.3 ± 8.5%. Mean wear time of the WCD was 111.8 ± 74.5 days. Recorded median heart rate using the WCD was 70.8 (IQR 63.1 - 78.7) beats per minute on the first wear day and 64.5 (IQR 59.7 - 71.3) on the last wear day. Median step count amounted to 4294 (IQR 2283 - 7092) steps on the first wear day compared to 5688 (IQR 3153 - 8263) steps on the last wear day. Median HRV5 was 85.4 (IQR 60.1 - 109.8) ms on the first wear day and 110.4 (IQR 78.6 - 134.9) ms on the last wear day. Between the first and last seven days of usage, median heart rate was significantly reduced (69.5 (IQR 62.0 - 76.8) to 65.9 (IQR 60.4 - 72.2) beats per minute; p < 0.001), while median step counts per day (4657 (IQR 2778 - 6918) to 5562 (IQR 3890 - 8446) steps; p < 0.001) and HRV5 (89.0 (IQR 64.8 - 110.7) to 111.0 (IQR 83.7 - 134.7) ms; p < 0.001) were significantly elevated. A higher delta of heart rate correlated with a higher delta of HRV5A (p < 0,001; rs = 0.488) between the first and last seven days of usage. A higher delta of step counts per day in the first and last seven days correlated with a higher HRV5 (p < 0.001; rs = 0.320). Patients with a higher delta of step count per day (p = 0,005; rs = 0,189) and patients with a higher delta of HRV5 (p = < 0.001; rs = 0.255) showed a higher delta of LVEF measured at prescription and three months follow-up. Conclusion: The WCD provides heart failure monitoring using additional heart failure parameters. Patients with newly diagnosed heart failure show a significant difference in heart rate, step count per day and heart rate variability approximate between beginning and end of prescription time. Step count and heart rate variability correlate with LVEF reverse remodeling. Remote monitoring for parameters regarding heart failure might be helpful for close monitoring and further heart failure therapy optimization during WCD wearing."

Supervised exercise therapy is the recommended first line management; however, this is often limited by accessibility, compliance and cost. As such, there has been an increased interest in the use of wearable activity monitors (WAMs) in home based telemonitoring exercise programmes for claudicants. This review aims to evaluate the efficacy of WAM as a feedback and monitoring tool in home based exercise programmes for patients with IC. Data Sources: A search strategy was devised. The databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched through to April 2020. Review Methods: Randomised trials and prospective trials were included. Eligible trials had to incorporate WAMs as a feedback tool to target walking/exercise behaviour. The primary outcome was the change in walking ability. Study quality was assessed with risk of bias tool. Results: A total of 1148 records were retrieved. Of these, eight randomised controlled trials and one prospective cohort study, all of which compared a WAM intervention against standard care and/or supervised exercise, met the inclusion criteria. Owing to heterogeneity between studies, no meta-analysis was conducted. WAM interventions improved measures of walking ability (heterogeneous outcomes such as maximum walking distance, claudication distance and six minute walk distance), increased daily walking activity (steps/day), cardiovascular metrics (maximum oxygen consumption), and quality of life. Conclusion: There is some evidence that home based WAM interventions are beneficial for improving walking ability and quality of life in patients with IC. However, existing studies are limited by inadequate sample size, duration, and appropriate power. Achieving consensus on outcome reporting and study methods, as well as maximising device adherence, is needed."

The system features a wearable respiratory and activity monitor, an environmental sensor and a pulse oximeter sending the data through a 5G router to a Multi-Edge Computing server, incorporated in the Vodafone 5G infrastructure, where they are stored and accessible for visualization. In particular, activity, respiratory and environmental data are continuously streamed and collected. The solution has been tested on 18 healthy volunteers during non-supervised recordings lasting at least 48 hours. The combination of recognized activities and associated respiratory parameters provided statistically significant variations in breathing patterns between one activity and the other, thus giving more complete information to the clinicians than previously studied telemedicine systems based on spot-checks. In particular, statistically significant differences are found in tidal volume and minute ventilation between horizontal and vertical postures (p < 0.001) and between vertical postures and dynamic activities (p < 0.001); the respiratory rate shows statistically significant differences between horizontal and vertical postures (p < 0.001). Some environmental parameters have different mean values between day and night, such as carbon dioxide (p < 0.001). Trials on patients are needed to further study this telemedicine solution and make it commercially available in the future.

This paper reviews low-cost and accessible Internet of Things (IoT) technologies with the aim of informing biomedical engineers of possibilities, workflows and limitations they present. In doing so, we evidence their use within healthcare research through literature and experimentation. As hardware becomes more affordable and feature rich, the cost of data magnifies. This can be limiting for biomedical engineers exploring low-cost solutions as data costs can make IoT approaches unscalable.

IoT-based healthcare has a significant impact on real-time remote monitoring of patients’ health and consequently improving treatments and reducing healthcare costs. In fact, IoT has made healthcare more reliable, efficient, and accessible. Two major drawbacks which IoT suffers from can be expressed as: first, the limited battery capacity of the sensors is quickly depleted due to the continuous stream of data; second, the dependence of the system on the cloud for computations and processing causes latency in data transmission which is not accepted in real-time monitoring applications. This research is conducted to develop a real-time, secure, and energy-efficient platform which provides a solution for reducing computation load on the cloud and diminishing data transmission delay. In the proposed platform, the sensors utilize a state-of-the-art power saving technique known as Compressive Sensing (CS). CS allows sensors to retrieve the sensed data using fewer measurements by sending a compressed signal. In this framework, the signal reconstruction and processing are computed locally on a Heterogeneous Multicore Platform (HMP) device to decrease the dependency on the cloud. In addition, a framework has been implemented to control the system, set different parameters, display the data as well as send live notifications to medical experts through the cloud in order to alert them of any eventual hazardous event or abnormality and allow quick interventions. Finally, a case study of the system is presented demonstrating the acquisition and monitoring of the data for a given subject in real-time. The obtained results reveal that the proposed solution reduces 15.4% of energy consumption in sensors, that makes this prototype a good candidate for IoT employment in healthcare."

Collection of sweat typically relies on absorbent pads that are incompatible with remote monitoring and deployment in field settings due to contaminants in the pads, long-term exposure of sweat to skin, and the need for centrifuges for extraction. Recent advances in the development of wearable microfluidic sensors that capture and analyze sweat dynamics offer new possibilities for tracking sweat biomarkers. This study presents a novel, wearable microfluidic device (the ‘Discovery patch’) that carefully captures small sweat volumes (10-150 μL), quantifies rates of excretion, and supports extraction for external lab analysis. Discovery patches were skin-mounted on the forearms of healthy subjects (n=10) who perspired in an environment chamber (40-45°C). Sweat captured in the Discovery patch was extracted and stored in cryovials, frozen, then analyzed by immunoassay to quantify cytokines (IL-1α, IL-1RA, and IL-8) across 3 anatomic regions (upper forearm and bilateral lower forearms). IL-1α and IL-1RA were present at significant quantities (2.0±1.6 and 2.9±2.9 ng/mL, respectively), whereas IL-8 was near the noise floor (1.1±0.7 pg/mL). Moreover, IL-1α and IL-1RA concentrations were independent of sweat rate (R2=0.1 and R2=0.02) and anatomic region (p=0.93 and p=0.99), and demonstrated diurnal fluctuations (p<0.01 and p<0.05, respectively), a striking phenomenon reported previously in serum tests. These results show that the Discovery patch is a robust tool for non-invasive tracking of inflammation biomarkers.

Objective: In this study, we aimed to verify the feasibility of a treatment model that involves applying a wearable motion sensor device to assist patients conduct home-based exercises to improve training compliance and the accuracy of exercises, with the ultimate goal of improving the functional recovery of patients with AC. Methods: The motion sensor device was comprised of inertial measurement unit-based sensors and mobile apps for patients and physicians, offering shoulder mobility tracing, home-based exercise support, and progress monitoring. The interrater reliability of shoulder mobility measurement using the motion sensor device on 10 healthy participants and 15 patients with AC was obtained using an intraclass correlation coefficient analysis and compared with the assessments performed by two highly experienced physicians. A pilot prospective control trial was then carried out to allocate the 15 patients with AC to two groups: home-based exercise group and motion sensor-assisted rehabilitation group. Changes in active and passive shoulder ROM, pain and functional scores, and exercise completion rates were compared between the groups during a treatment period of 3 months. Results: Shoulder ROM, as measured using the motion sensor device, exhibited good to excellent reliability based on the comparison with the measurements of two physicians (intraclass correlation coefficient range, 0.771 to 0.979). Compared with patients with AC in the home-based exercise group, those in the motion sensor-assisted rehabilitation group exhibited better shoulder mobility and functional recovery and a higher exercise completion rate during and after 3 months of rehabilitation. Conclusions: Motion sensor device-assisted home-based rehabilitation for the treatment of AC is a useful treatment model for telerehabilitation that enhances the compliance of patients through training, thus improving functional recovery. This helps overcome important obstacles in physiotherapy at home by providing comprehensible and easily accessible exercise instructions, enhancing compliance, ensuring the correctness of exercise, and monitoring the progress of patients."

This study aimed to investigate the potential of low-cost Rift Valley Lake magnesium (RVL-Mg) source for phosphorus recovery from urine, where data is deficient in the source area. The effect of various operational conditions such as storage, Mg:P ratio (0.8–2.0), pH (5.5–10.5), mixing speed (30–180 rpm), urease enzyme addition (50–700 μL), urine dilution (0.11–9.0) and Ca:Mg ratio (0.3–2.5) was investigated. Under optimum operating conditions (M:P = 1.6, pH = 9, urease enzyme = 500 μL, mixing speed = 120 rpm, 60 min precipitation), the phosphorus removal efficiencies were >96% for actual and >98% for synthetic urine. During storage, spontaneous phosphorus losses were observed from synthetic (24.0%) and actual (32.0%) hydrolyzed urine due to precipitation with calcium and magnesium. The phosphorus recovery efficiency was reduced at higher (0.11:1) and lower (9:1) urine to RVL-Mg dilution, which is related to lower supersaturation of phosphorus and magnesium ions, respectively. Addition of calcium did not affect phosphorus removal efficiency, but the effect was significant on crystal product. With low (<1.0) Ca:Mg ratio, the crystal chemical analysis showed that the product has to be pure struvite (>99%), which was further identified by scanning electron microscope and X-ray diffraction to be quality struvite that might be used for agricultural purpose. Overall, low-cost magnesium ion collected from Rift Valley Lake can be a potentially candidate for sustainable phosphorus recovery from urine and any other phosphorus containing waste stream."

In this context, during the last decade, numerous publicly accessible databases have been released aiming at offering a common benchmarking tool for the validation of the new proposals on FDSs. This work offers a comparative and updated analysis of these existing repositories. For this purpose, the samples contained in the datasets are characterized by different statistics that model diverse aspects of the mobility of the human body in the time interval where the greatest change in the acceleration module is identified.

Inan,Cardiac Function Monitoring for Patients Undergoing Cancer Treatments Using Wearable Seismocardiography: A Proof-of-Concept Study,,"Advances in cancer therapeutics have dramatically improved the survival rate and quality of life in patients affected by various cancers, but have been accompanied by treatment-related cardiotoxicity, e.g. left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and/or overt heart failure (HF). Cardiologists thus need to assess cancer treatment-related cardiotoxic risks and have close followups for cancer survivors and patients undergoing cancer treatments using serial echocardiography exams and cardiovascular biomarkers testing. Unfortunately, the cost-prohibitive nature of echocardiography has made these routine follow-ups difficult and not accessible to the growing number of cancer survivors and patients undergoing cancer treatments. There is thus a need to develop a wearable system that can yield similar information at a minimal cost and can be used for remote monitoring of these patients. In this proof-of-concept study, we have investigated the use of wearable seismocardiography (SCG) to monitor LV function non-invasively for patients undergoing cancer treatment. A total of 12 subjects (six with normal LV relaxation, five with impaired relaxation and one with pseudo-normal relaxation) underwent routine echocardiography followed by a standard six-minute walk test. Wearable SCG and electrocardiogram signals were collected during the six-minute walk test and, later, the signal features were compared between subjects with normal and impaired LV relaxation. Pre-ejection period (PEP) from SCG decreased significantly (p <; 0.05) during exercise for the subjects with impaired relaxation compared to the subjects with normal relaxation, and changes in PEP/LV ejection time (LVET) were also significantly different between these two groups (p <; 0.05). These results suggest that wearable SCG may enable monitoring of patients undergoing cancer treatments by assessing cardiotoxicity."

Parizi,Blockchain Technology and Neural Networks for the Internet of Medical Things,,"In today's technological climate, users require fast automation and digitization of results for large amounts of data at record speeds. Especially in the field of medicine, where each patient is often asked to undergo many different examinations within one diagnosis or treatment. Each examination can help in the diagnosis or prediction of further disease progression. Furthermore, all produced data from these examinations must be stored somewhere and available to various medical practitioners for analysis who may be in geographically diverse locations. The current medical climate leans towards remote patient monitoring and AI-assisted diagnosis. To make this possible, medical data should ideally be secured and made accessible to many medical practitioners, which makes them prone to malicious entities. Medical information has inherent value to malicious entities due to its privacy-sensitive nature in a variety of ways. Furthermore, if access to data is distributively made available to AI algorithms (particularly neural networks) for further analysis/diagnosis, the danger to the data may increase (e.g., model poisoning with fake data introduction). In this paper, we propose a federated learning approach that uses decentralized learning with blockchain-based security and a proposition that accompanies that training intelligent systems using distributed and locally-stored data for the use of all patients. Our work in progress hopes to contribute to the latest trend of the Internet of Medical Things security and privacy."

As global life expectancy continues to rise, there is an increasing need for unobtrusive health monitoring systems that can facilitate the early identification of health issues, particularly among the elderly. While many healthcare monitoring technologies exist, their limited accessibility and deployment in controlled environments or healthcare facilities present challenges. To address this, our innovative concept proposes a smart IoT-based outdoor health monitoring system, specifically designed for public spaces such as parks and supermarkets. This system aims to collect data on mobility, posture, and gait, recognising the crucial role that gait plays in an individual's well-being. The proposed system leverages the power of the Internet of Things (IoT) to gather data seamlessly from individuals in their everyday environments, creating a more holistic and real-world understanding of their health. By analysing gait patterns and deviations, our conceptual framework aims to serve as an early warning system for health-care providers, caregivers, and individuals themselves, alerting them to potential health concerns and enabling proactive intervention. This concept, while in its early stages, holds immense promise for addressing the challenges of an ageing population and reducing healthcare disparities. It aligns with the broader vision of harnessing emerging technologies to enhance the quality of life for the elderly."

Govindaraj; S. D. A. Murugan,An Early Warning Smart Healthcare Kit to Avoid Road Accidents,,"Smart health kits are innovative devices that can monitor various health-related parameters in real time. Inadequate healthcare facilities in rural areas, people have limited access to quality healthcare services, leading to increased morbidity and mortality rates. Lack of patient monitoring makes it challenging to identify and treat illnesses in their early stages since remote patients frequently do not receive routine checkups and monitoring. The enormous cost of healthcare is a significant burden for many individuals, particularly those living in poverty. Inefficient healthcare delivery in the traditional healthcare system is often bogged down by bureaucracy and inefficiency, leading to long wait times, incorrect diagnoses, and ineffective treatments. Real-time healthcare monitoring is necessary to deliver effective treatment. Real-time patient data, such as vital signs, medical history, and other pertinent information, must be available to healthcare practitioners. The goal of the smart healthcare kit using an embedded system is to address the health problems of persons while driving vehicles. The embedded medical sensors such as temperature, heart rate, and alcohol gas sensors collect and transmit patient data to healthcare providers in real time enabling them to make informed decisions about patient care. This kit may be mounted to the steering wheel of any vehicle, making it simple to use and accessible for anyone while driving. The temperature sensor keeps track of the driver’s body temperature and alerts the driver if it rises above a certain threshold. The heart rate sensor monitors the heart rate and notifies the user when it changes unexpectedly. Similarly, an alcohol gas sensor measures the alcohol concentration in the driver’s exhaled breath to determine whether they have consumed alcohol. Thus, the smart health kit is an effective tool that can detect serious health hazards, ensure motorists are healthy while operating vehicles, and prevent accidents caused by medical conditions or alcohol consumption; this greatly increases the safety of individuals, particularly those who drive professionally. The availability of real-time health monitoring and notifications enables people to take preventative action to maintain their health and stay safe."

This paper characterizes experiences with remote monitoring across the U.S. CF community. METHODS: The CF Foundation (CFF) sponsored distribution of home spirometers (April 2020 to May 2021), surveys to PwCF and CF programs (July to September 2020), and a second program survey (April to May 2021). We used mixed methods to explore access, use, and perspectives regarding the use of remote monitoring in future care. RESULTS: By October 2020, 13,345 spirometers had been distributed, and 19,271 spirometers by May 2021. Programs (n=286) estimated proportions of PwCF with home devices increased over seven months: spirometers (30% to 70%), scales (50% to 70%), oximeters (5% to 10%) with higher estimates in adult programs for spirometers and oximeters. PwCF (n=378) had access to scales (89%), followed by oximeters (48%) and spirometers (47%), often using scales and oximeters weekly, and spirometers monthly. Over both surveys, some programs had no method to collect respiratory specimens for cultures associated with telehealth visits (47%, n=132; 41%, n=118). Most programs (81%) had a process for phlebotomy associated with a telehealth visit, primarily through off-site labs. Both PwCF and programs felt future care should advance remote monitoring and recommended improvements for access, training, and data collection systems. CONCLUSIONS: PwCF and programs experienced unprecedented access to remote monitoring and raised its importance for future care. Improvements to current systems may leverage these shared experiences to augment future care models."

One area which was expected to significantly improve the quality of and access to primary healthcare services in particular is remote patient monitoring and management. Based on a combination of rapid advances in body sensors and information and communication technologies (ICT), it was hoped that remote patient management tools and systems (RPMTSs) would significantly reduce the care burden on traditional healthcare systems as well as health-related costs. However, the uptake or adoption of above systems has been extremely slow and their roll out has not yet properly taken off especially in developing countries where they ought to have made the greatest positive impact. AIM: The aim of the study was to assess whether or not recent, relevant literature would support the development of in-community, design, deployment and implementation framework based on three factors thought to be important drivers and levers of RPMTS's adoption and scalability. METHODS: A rapid, scoping review conducted on relevant articles obtained from PubMed, MEDLINE, PMC and Cochrane databases and grey literature on Google and published between 2012 and May 2020, by combining a number of relevant search terms and phrases. RESULTS: Most RPMTSs are targeted at and focused on a single disease, do not extensively involve patients and clinicians in their early planning and design phases, are not designed to best serve a specific catchment area and are mainly directed at post-hospital, disease management settings. This may be leading to a situation where patients, potential patients and clinicians simply do not make use of these tools, leading to low adoption and scalability thereof. CONCLUSION: The development of a user-centred, context-dependent, customizable design and deployment framework could potentially increase the adoption and scalability of RPMTSs, if such framework addressed a combination of diseases, prevalent in a given specific catchment area, especially in developing countries with limited financial resources."

Importantly, telemedicine, the delivery of health care and/or health information using electronic systems, can deliver primary and specialized health care to geographically isolated patients, who account for nearly 20% of the US population. In nephrology, where a growing discrepancy exists between the geographic location of nephrologists and patients with kidney disease, telenephrology can bridge distance and deliver renal care and education to the isolated. Large nationalized health care systems, for which incentives are aligned to innovate and implement new platforms to deliver cost-effective care, have been at the forefront of telenephrology. These systems include synchronous direct physician-patient care through clinical videoconferencing, and asynchronous modalities such as electronic consultation and video telehealth to educate internists about specialized clinical topics. Large health care organizations are adopting these platforms as standalone services; however, expansion into the private health care system has been limited by reimbursement, regulations, and other issues. Though telenephrology is patient centered, studies are needed to rigorously test its clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness. Nonetheless, growing patient demand for patient-centric health care will continue to expand the telenephrology space."

The association of remote technology use and other decentralization tools that can reduce these barriers with likelihood to enroll in cancer trials is not well understood. OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of remote technology and other decentralization tools used to reduce participation-related time and travel with the likelihood to enroll in cancer clinical trials. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Between July 6 and September 8, 2021, a 41-question, cross-sectional, internet-based survey was administered to patients with cancer and survivors of cancer in the US who had been diagnosed with or treated for cancer in the past 7 years. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Increase in self-reported likelihood to enroll in cancer clinical trials that use remote technology and other decentralization tools to decrease the need for travel to the trial site. RESULTS: There were 1183 survey respondents, with a mean (SD) age of 58.2 (12.5) years. Respondents self-reported their gender, race and ethnicity, cancer type, and treatment status. Of the 1183 respondents, 848 (72%) were female, 296 (25%) were male, 8 (1%) were other/nonbinary, and 31 (3%) declined to answer. With regard to race, 28 respondents (3%) were American Indian or Alaska Native, 25 (2%) were Asian, 234 (20%) were Black or African American, 20 (2%) were Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, 825 (70%) were White, and 51 (4%) declined to answer. With regard to ethnicity, 115 respondents (10%) were Hispanic, Latino/Latina, or of Spanish origin, whereas 1017 (86%) were not and 51 (4%) declined to answer. Regarding cancer type and treatment status, 483 respondents (41%) either had or had survived breast cancer and 325 (28%) were being treated for cancer during the survey period. Individuals older than 55 years were more likely to say that they would only participate in trials no farther from their home than their regular care health care practitioner compared with younger respondents (26% vs 16%, respectively; P = .02). Higher-income earners (ie, those in households earning >$125 000/y) were significantly more likely than lower-income earners (ie, those in households earning <$70 000/y) to say they would participate in trials requiring additional effort (62% vs 41%, respectively; P = .03). If given the opportunity to enroll in a cancer clinical trial that required travel farther than their regular care, a majority of respondents (range, 60%-85%) indicated that they would be more likely to participate if the trial used remote technology and other tools to decrease the need for travel to a trial site. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study, the survey findings suggest that cancer clinical trials leveraging remote technology and decentralization tools to reduce patient time and travel burden associated with participation may increase the patient consent rate."

Indeed, to prevent spreading of CoViD-19 infection among extremely fragile dialysis patients, as well as among dialysis workers, hemodialysis (HD) centers are adopting specific procedures (""dedicated"" dialysis facilities, portable osmosis, etc.) with a great economic and organizational commitment. Peritoneal dialysis (PD) represents a type of home dialysis therapy not yet adequately implemented to date, in spite of safe and simple practice, as well as similar dialytic efficiency vs in-center hemodialysis. Remote patient monitoring (RPM) systems have been developed in automated PD (APD) cyclers in order to improve the acceptance of this dialysis method, to increase the compliance to the prescribed therapy and to control treatment adequacy. In this review we assess the potential advantages of RPM in APD, that are the chance for patients to acquire greater independence and safety in the home treatment, to allow better access to care for residents in remote areas, faster resolution of problems, reduction in hospitalizations and mortality rates, as well as time and cost saving for both the patient and the staff. The use of medical devices (sphygmomanometer, glucometer, balance, etc.), connected by wireless to the clinician's portal, might also allow a wider diffusion of incremental dialysis, an integrated therapy that combines conservative management of ESKD patients with a soft dialysis based on the residual kidney function and symptomatology, with potential prognosis and economic benefits.

This topic is very important, as telemedicine and mHealth, when applied to dermatology, could improve both the quality of healthcare for citizens and the workflow in the health domain. The proposed study was centered on the last three years. We conducted an overview on the opportunities, the perspectives, and the problems involved in TD integration with mHealth. The methodology of the narrative review was based on: (I) a search of PubMed and Scopus and (II) an eligibility assessment, using properly proposed parameters. The outcome of the study showed that during the COVID-19 pandemic, TD integration with mHealth advanced rapidly. This integration enabled the monitoring of dermatological problems and facilitated remote specialist visits, reducing face-to-face interactions. AI and mobile apps have empowered citizens to take an active role in their healthcare. This differs from other imaging sectors where information exchange is limited to professionals. The opportunities for TD in mHealth include improving service quality, streamlining healthcare processes, reducing costs, and providing more accessible care. It can be applied to various conditions, such as (but not limited to) acne, vitiligo, psoriasis, and skin cancers. Integration with AI and augmented reality (AR), as well as the use of wearable sensors, are anticipated as future developments. However, integrating TD with mHealth also brings about problems and challenges related to regulations, ethics, cybersecurity, data privacy, and device management. Scholars and policymakers need to address these issues while involving citizens in the process."

However, the digital phenotype, which refers to the analysis of data collected by measuring human behavior with mobile sensors and smart bracelets, is a promising tool for filling this gap in current clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study are to develop the digital phenotyping of patients with alcohol use disorder and anxiety symptoms using data collected from a mobile device (ie, smartphone) and a wearable sensor (ie, Fitbit) and to analyze usability and patient satisfaction with the data collection service provided by the app. METHODS: We propose to conduct a study among a group of 60 participants split into two subgroups-experimental and control-of 30 participants each. The experimental group will be recruited by physicians from the Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, and the control group will be recruited on a volunteer basis through fliers and social media. All participants will go through pretraining to ensure technological capability and understanding of tasks, then each participant will download the HumanITcare app and will be given a wearable sensor (ie, Fitbit). Throughout the 4-month period, participants will be monitored on a range of factors, including sleep cycle, heart rate, movement patterns, and sociability. All data from the wearable sensors and the mobile devices will be saved and sent to the HumanITcare server. Participants will be asked to complete weekly questionnaires about anxiety, depression, and alcohol use disorder symptoms. Research assistants will ensure timely responses. The data from both sensors will then be compared to the questionnaire responses to determine how accurately the devices can predict the same symptoms. RESULTS: The recruitment phase was completed in November 2019 and all the data were collected by the end of December 2019. Data are being processed; this process is expected to be completed by October 2020. CONCLUSIONS: This study was created and conducted as a pilot study with the Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, with the purpose of exploring the feasibility of our approach. The study is focused on patients diagnosed with anxiety and alcohol use disorder, but participants were also monitored for depressive symptoms throughout the trial, although these were not part of the initial inclusion criteria. A limitation to our study was the exclusive use of Android smartphones over iOS devices; this could result in a potential selection bias, due to the accessibility and affordability of Android phones as opposed to iOS-based phones. Another limitation might be that reviews of usability and satisfaction could be confounded by factors such as age and familiarity. An additional function that we might add in future studies is the ability for patients to manage their own data. INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): DERR1-10.2196/16964."

In wireless implantable sensors, the distance between the sensor and the reader device is prone to be influenced by the operating frequency, as well as by the medium between the sensor and the reader. This manuscript presents an ex vivo investigation of the wireless linkage between an implantable sensor and an external reader for medical applications. The sensor was designed and fabricated using a cost-effective and accessible fabrication process. The sensor is composed of a circular planar inductor (L) and a circular planar capacitor (C) to form an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonance tank circuit. The reader system comprises a readout coil and data acquisition instrumentation. To investigate the effect of biological medium on wireless linkage, the readout distance between the sensor and the readout coil was examined independently for porcine and ovine tissues. In the bench model, to mimic the bio-environment for the investigation, skin, muscle, and fat tissues were used. The relative magnitude of the reflection coefficient (S11) at the readout coil was used as a metric to benchmark wireless linkage. A readable linkage signal was observed on the readout coil when the sensor was held up to 2.5 cm under layers of skin, muscle, and fat tissue. To increase the remote readout distance of the LC sensor, the effect of the repeater coil was also investigated. The experimental results showed that the magnitude of the reflection coefficient signal was increased 3-3.5 times in the presence of the repeater coil, thereby increasing the signal-to-noise ratio of the detected signal. Therefore, the repeater coil between the sensor and the readout coil allows a larger sensing range for a variety of applications in implanted or sealed fields."

In France, there are several pathways for medical devices to enter the market, from diagnosis-related group tariffs to reimbursement lists. However, traditional regulatory pathways can delay market access for innovative technologies. In response, France has established Early Access Programs to expedite patient access to medical devices. This paper looks at three of these Early Access Programs for medical devices. Innovation Funding, introduced in its final version in 2015, provides temporary coverage for innovative devices and facilitates data collection for informed funding decisions. Transitional Coverage (PECT), established in 2021, targets CE-marked devices for rare or serious conditions. Transitional coverage for digital health applications (PECAN), introduced in 2022, covers digital medical devices, either therapeutic or for patient monitoring. Innovation funding has been granted to 16 technologies out of 35 applications (46%) since 2015. 6 technologies out of 11 (64%) applications benefit from PECT. PECAN, in its first year, has granted a telemonitoring solution with a favourable opinion.

Photoplethysmography (PPG), a technology commonly used in wearable devices such as smartwatches, has shown promise for constructing ECGs. Several methods have been proposed for ECG reconstruction using PPG signals, but some require signal alignment during the training phase, which is not feasible in real-life settings where ECG signals are not collected at the same time as PPG signals. To address this challenge, we introduce PPG2ECGps, an end-to-end, patient-specific deep-learning neural network utilizing the W-Net architecture. This novel approach enables direct ECG signal reconstruction from PPG signals, eliminating the need for signal alignment. Our experiments show that the proposed model achieves mean values of 0.977 mV for Pearson's correlation coefficient, 0.037 mV for the root mean square error, and 0.010 mV for the normalized dynamic time-warped distance when comparing reconstructed ECGs to reference ECGs from a dataset of 500 records. As PPG signals are more accessible than ECG signals, our proposed model has significant potential to improve patient monitoring and diagnosis in healthcare settings via wearable devices."

In response to heightened demands for mental health interventions that are accessible and affordable, there has been a recent rise in the number of digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) that have been developed and incorporated into mental health treatments. Digital interventions are promising in their ability to provide researchers, medical practitioners, and patients with personalized tools for assessing behavior, consultation, treatment, and care that can be used remotely. Reviews and meta-analyses have shown the benefits of DMHIs for the treatment and prevention of depression, anxiety, and other mental illnesses, but there is still a lack of studies that focus on the benefits and use of DMHIs in the older population. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review is to investigate the current evidence for the effect of technology-delivered interventions, such as smartphone/tablet applications, remote monitoring and tracking devices, and wearable technology, for the treatment and prevention of depression and anxiety in adults older than 50 years. METHODS: The academic databases SCOPUS, PsycINFO, AgeLine (EBSCO), and Medline (PubMed) will be searched from January 1, 2010, to the date of search commencement to provide a review of existing randomized controlled trial studies. The search will include 3 key concepts: ""older adults,"" ""digital intervention,"" and ""depression/anxiety."" A set of inclusion criteria will be followed during screening by two reviewers. Data will be extracted to address aims and objectives of the review. The risk of bias for each study will be determined using appropriate tools. If possible, a random-effects meta-analysis will be performed, and the heterogeneity of effect sizes will be calculated. RESULTS: Preliminary searches were conducted in September 2020. The review is anticipated to be completed by April 2021. CONCLUSIONS: The data accumulated in this systematic review will demonstrate the potential benefits of technology-delivered interventions for the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders in older adults.

The sensor device is implanted into the patient's body, and the sensed health information of patients is transformed via data aggregating devices like mobile devices, cameras, and so on, to the doctors. Thus, the early signs of diseases are identified, and remote monitoring of the patient's health is carried out by the physician on time. This aids in improving the health condition of the people and reduces the severity of disorders. But, the security gap in HC remains unresolved, despite various advantages. OBJECTIVE: This work proposes secured data communication in WSHN using Exponential Message Digest5 (EXP-MD5) and Diffie Hellman Secret Key-based Elliptic Curve Cryptography (DHSK-ECC) techniques. METHODS: Primarily, the patient registers their details in the Hospital Cloud Server (HCS). With hospital ID and patient ID, public and private keys are generated during registration. Afterward, by utilizing the Navie Shuffling (NS) technique, nCr combinations are created and shuffled. After shuffling, any of the randomly selected combinations are encoded utilizing the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) code. For patient authentication, the ASCII code is further converted into a Quick Response(QR) code. Upon successful registration, the patient logs in to HCS. The patient can book for doctor's appointment if the login details are verified with those of the registered details. On consulting the doctor at the pre-informed time, the digital signature is created utilizing the Universal Unique Salt-based Digital Signature Algorithm (UUS-DSA) for authenticating the patient details. Further, for providing accessibility to all the authorized patients, the registered patients on HCS are considered as nodes. Then, an authorized path is created using the EXP-MD5 technique to protect each individual patient's details. The patient's IoT data is sensed, followed by authorized path creation. The data is encrypted via the DHSK-ECC algorithm for secure data transmission. Lastly, all the information is stored in HCS, so that the patient's health condition is regularly monitored by the doctor and the needy advice is suggested to the patients in the future. Also, hash matching is carried out when the doctor needs to access data. RESULTS: The proposed technique's efficacy is validated by the performance analysis in comparison with other conventional techniques. CONCLUSION: In this proposed research, the authentication is performed in multiple scenarios to enhance data security and user privacy. The patient details are authenticated during registration and verification to access the online consultation only by the authorized person. Further, the patient health information is encrypted in the proposed work after consultation so that the intrusion of medical records by malicious users and data tampering is prevented. Also, the sensed data gathered from patients are transferred to the HCS by creating the authorized path, which further enhances the security of patient data. Thus, the data communication of the WSHN is well-secured in this work through multi-level authentication and improved cryptography techniques."

Accurate and timely symptom monitoring is critical to offering prompt and time-sensitive clinical services. Digital health is a promising solution for the barriers encountered by conventional symptom monitoring approaches, including accessibility, the ecological validity of assessments, and recall bias. However, to date, there has been no digital health technology developed to support self-management for people with psychosis in China. OBJECTIVE: We report the study protocol to evaluate the validity, feasibility, acceptability, usability, and safety of a symptom self-monitoring smartphone app (YouXin; Chinese name ) for people with psychosis in China. METHODS: This is a nonrandomized validity and feasibility study with a mixed methods design. The study was approved by the University of Manchester and Beijing Anding Hospital Research Ethics Committee. YouXin is a smartphone app designed to facilitate symptom self-monitoring for people with psychosis. YouXin has 2 core functions: active monitoring of symptoms (ie, smartphone survey) and passive monitoring of behavioral activity (ie, passive data collection via embedded smartphone sensors). The development process of YouXin utilized a systematic coproduction approach. A series of coproduction consultation meetings was conducted by the principal researcher with service users and clinicians to maximize the usability and acceptability of the app for end users. Participants with psychosis aged 16 years to 65 years were recruited from Beijing Anding Hospital, Beijing, China. All participants were invited to use the YouXin app to self-monitor symptoms for 4 weeks. At the end of the 4-week follow-up, we invited participants to take part in a qualitative interview to explore the acceptability of the app and trial procedures postintervention. RESULTS: Recruitment to the study was initiated in August 2022. Of the 47 participants who were approached for the study from August 2022 to October 2022, 41 participants agreed to take part in the study. We excluded 1 of the 41 participants for not meeting the inclusion criteria, leaving a total of 40 participants who began the study. As of December 2022, 40 participants had completed the study, and the recruitment was complete. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to develop and test a symptom self-monitoring app specifically designed for people with psychosis in China. If the study shows the feasibility of YouXin, a potential future direction is to integrate the app into clinical workflows to facilitate digital mental health care for people with psychosis in China. This study will inform improvements to the app, trial procedures, and implementation strategies with this population. Moreover, the findings of this trial could lead to optimization of digital health technologies designed for people with psychosis in China.

Incorporating cognitive and physiological biomarkers using noninvasive sensors combined with self-reported questionnaires can provide a more accurate characterization of the individual's well-being. Biomarkers such as heart rate variability or those extracted from the electrodermal activity signal are commonly considered as indices of autonomic nervous system functioning, providing objective indicators of stress response. A model combining a set of these biomarkers can constitute a comprehensive tool to remotely assess mental well-being and distress. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to design and validate a remote multiparametric tool, including physiological and cognitive variables, to objectively assess mental well-being and distress. METHODS: This ongoing observational study pursues to enroll 60 young participants (aged 18-34 years) in 3 groups, including participants with high mental well-being, participants with mild to moderate psychological distress, and participants diagnosed with depression or anxiety disorder. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are being evaluated through a web-based questionnaire, and for those with a mental health condition, the criteria are identified by psychologists. The assessment consists of collecting mental health self-reported measures and physiological data during a baseline state, the Stroop Color and Word Test as a stress-inducing stage, and a final recovery period. Several variables related to heart rate variability, pulse arrival time, breathing, electrodermal activity, and peripheral temperature are collected using medical and wearable devices. A second assessment is carried out after 1 month. The assessment tool will be developed using self-reported questionnaires assessing well-being (short version of Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7), and depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) as the reference. We will perform correlation and principal component analysis to reduce the number of variables, followed by the calculation of multiple regression models.

Advanced technologies using techniques such as photoplethysmography have the potential to automate noncontact physiological monitoring and recording, improving the quality and accessibility of this essential clinical information. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aim to develop the algorithm used in the Lifelight software application and improve the accuracy of its estimated heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and blood pressure measurements. METHODS: This preliminary study will compare measurements predicted by the Lifelight software with standard of care measurements for an estimated population sample of 2000 inpatients, outpatients, and healthy people attending a large acute hospital. Both training datasets and validation datasets will be analyzed to assess the degree of correspondence between the vital sign measurements predicted by the Lifelight software and the direct physiological measurements taken using standard of care methods. Subgroup analyses will explore how the performance of the algorithm varies with particular patient characteristics, including age, sex, health condition, and medication. RESULTS: Recruitment of participants to this study began in July 2018, and data collection will continue for a planned study period of 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Digital health technology is a rapidly evolving area for health and social care. Following this initial exploratory study to develop and refine the Lifelight software application, subsequent work will evaluate its performance across a range of health characteristics, and extended validation trials will support its pathway to registration as a medical device. Innovations in health technology such as this may provide valuable opportunities for increasing the efficiency and accessibility of vital sign measurements and improve health care services on a large scale across multiple health and care settings.

The Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) SOPHIA (Stratification of Obesity Phenotypes to Optimize Future Obesity Therapy) project is part of a momentum shift aiming to provide better tools for the stratification of people with obesity according to disease risk and treatment response. One of the challenges to achieving these goals is that many clinical cohorts are siloed, limiting the potential of combined data for biomarker discovery. In SOPHIA, we have addressed this challenge by setting up a federated database building on open-source DataSHIELD technology. The database currently federates 16 cohorts that are accessible via a central gateway. The database is multi-modal, including research studies, clinical trials, and routine health data, and is accessed using the R statistical programming environment where statistical and machine learning analyses can be performed at a distance without any disclosure of patient-level data. We demonstrate the use of the database by providing a proof-of-concept analysis, performing a federated linear model of BMI and systolic blood pressure, pooling all data from 16 studies virtually without any analyst seeing individual patient-level data. This analysis provided similar point estimates compared to a meta-analysis of the 16 individual studies. Our approach provides a benchmark for reproducible, safe federated analyses across multiple study types provided by multiple stakeholders."

Pakistan is home to a rich diversity of halophytic flora, convertible into bounteous volumes of bioethanol. On the other hand, the accessibility to the cellulosic part of biomass is a major bottleneck in the successful application of biorefinery processes. The most common pre-treatment procedures existent include physicochemical and chemical approaches, which are not environmentally benign. To overcome these problems, biological pre-treatment has gained importance but the drawback is the low yield of the extracted monosaccharides. The current research was aimed at exploring the best pre-treatment method for the bioconversion of halophyte Atriplex crassifolia into saccharides using three thermostable cellulases. Atriplex crassifolia was subjected to acid, alkali and microwave pre-treatments, followed by compositional analysis of the pre-treated substrates. Maximum delignification i.e. 56.6% was observed in the substrate pre-treated using 3% HCl. Enzymatic saccharification using thermostable cellulases also validated the results where the highest saccharification yield i.e. 39.5% was observed for the sample pre-treated using same. Maximum enzymatic hydrolysis of 52.7% was obtained for 0.40 g of the pre-treated halophyte Atriplex crassifolia where Endo-1,4- β -glucanase (300U), Exo-1,4- β -glucanase (400U) and β -1,4-glucosidase (1000U) were simultaneously added and incubated for 6 h at 75°C. The reducing sugar slurry obtained after optimization of saccharification was utilized as glucose in submerged fermentation for bioethanol production. The fermentation medium was inoculated with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, incubated at 30°C and 180 rpm for 96 h. Ethanol production was estimated using potassium dichromate method. Maximum production of bioethanol i.e. 16.33% was noted at 72 h. It can be concluded from the study that Atriplex crassifolia owing to its high cellulosic content after pre-treatment using dilute acid method, yields substantial amount of reducing sugars and high saccharification rates when subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis using thermostable cellulases, under optimized reaction conditions. Hence, the halophyte Atriplex crassifolia is a beneficial substrate that can be utilized to extract fermentable saccharides for bioethanol production."

This study aims to assess parental acceptance and use of a commercially available intraoral camera (IOC) for effective remote monitoring. METHODS: 47 child-parent dyads, where the parent was the main caregiver and the child was treated under general anaesthesia for early childhood caries, were recruited. Caregivers were trained to image their child's teeth on a commercially available IOC. Subsequently, submitted images were reviewed asynchronously by dentists for image quality, presence of dislodged fillings, abscesses, cavitation, and oral hygiene. Post-surgery monitoring was performed using teledentistry at 1 and 2 months and in-person at 4 months. A modified Telehealth Usability Questionnaire (TUQ) was used to record caregiver acceptance for study procedures. RESULTS: A mean TUQ of 6.09 out of 7 was scored by caregivers. Caregiver-reported issues were limited to problems with technique and child uncooperativeness. The number of clear images during the second teledentistry review was improved compared to the first (p = 0.007). 68% of children liked having images of their teeth taken. CONCLUSION: This study supports the feasibility of using an IOC as a clinically appropriate avenue for teledentistry with a high level of caregiver-child acceptance."

CM is perceived as an advanced stage. It might be the first sign of a primary cancer or an indicator of recurrence. OBJECTIVES: To identify primary cancers associated with CMs and perform a survival analysis according to advanced stage of cutaneous metastasis at a single tertiary centre in Korea. METHODS: A total of 219 patients from Samsung Medical Center from January 2009 to April 2020 were retrospectively analysed to identify cases with biopsy-proven CMs. According to advanced stage of metastasis, patients were divided into three stages, CM only (CMO), CM with lymph node metastasis (CM/LM) and CM with distant metastasis (CM/DM), to analyse clinical characteristics and survival rate. RESULTS: The most common CM from primary cancer was breast cancer, followed by lung cancer, stomach cancer, colorectal cancer and others. When all primary cancers were included, the median survival period was 4.82 years for the CMO stage, 2.15 years for the CM/LM stage and 0.80 years for the CM/DM stage, with a tendency to deteriorate with advancing stage. At 1- and 3-year after occurrence of CM, the CM/DM stage showed a significantly poorer survival rate than the other two stages. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed a median survival period of 22 months for CM patients overall. Breast cancer has greater accessibility to the skin than other cancers. Therefore, breast cancer can metastasize to the skin without involving lymph nodes or other sites."

These advances are driven by a plethora of research dedicated to wearables-based biomechanical analysis enabling characterization of clinically relevant variables that previously required laboratory technology. Remote patient monitoring presents several advantages to the in-lab alternative in terms of observation frequency, accessibility, and ecological validity of patient evaluations. However, the extent to which these developments have translated for remotely monitoring patients with musculoskeletal conditions is unclear. This is addressed in the current review and, specifically, the characterization of human movement in terms of cumulative physical activity (e.g., step count) as an assessment distinct from stride-by-stride analysis (e.g., daily average stride frequency). EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The PubMed database was searched for relevant articles using terms related to the use of wearable sensors for remote monitoring of gait in patients with musculoskeletal conditions. References in each identified article were searched for additional studies to include. All outcome variables were categorized as either a measure of cumulative physical activity or as pertaining to a stride-by-stride level analysis.

For each situation, the percentage of errors in the developed scheme is less than 2%. The patient's situation is relayed to medical personnel via a portal, where they can monitor, process, and analyze the patient's real-time situation. A low-power communication device and an embedded smart IoT system are being designed and developed with the goal of covertly gathering physiological metrics without interfering with daily life. Sensor-based data analytics using machine learning methods were used in this study to identify predictors and/or sudden abnormality indicators accurately. The data for heart rate and body temperature is analyzed using the bio-medical sensors embedded with an ARM Cortex-A7 microcontroller.

Primary outcome: Major complications (MC) reduction. Secondary outcomes: Patients who reached discharge criteria within the 7th day from admission; difference in MC incidence at the conclusion of the standard telemonitoring/clinical monitoring phase, 5 and 30 days after discharge; and conditions predisposing to MC occurrence. Methods: Open label randomized controlled trial with wearable wireless system that creates alerts on portable devices. Continuous glycemic monitoring is performed for patients with diabetes mellitus. Results: There were 110 patients enrolled (mean age: 76.2 years). Comorbidity: Cumulative Illness Rating Scale CIRS-CI (comorbidities index): 3.93, CIRS SI (severity index): 1.93. About 19% scored a BRASS (Blaylock Risk Assessment Screening Score) ≥20 indicating need for discharge planning requiring step-down care. Globally, 48% of patients in the control group had major complications (27 out of 56 patients), in contrast to 22% in the intervention group (12 out of 54 patients).

This progress has brought forth a substantial prospect for healthcare services to enhance performance, transparency, and cost effectiveness. Internet of Things gateways, such as local computational facilities, mobile devices, or custom miniature computational embedded electronics like the Raspberry Pi (RPi), are crucial in facilitating the required processing and data compression tasks as well as serving as front-end event detectors. Numerous home-based healthcare monitoring systems are currently accessible; however, they have several limitations. This paper examines the role of the Raspberry Pi gateway in the healthcare system, specifically in the context of pre-operative prehabilitation programs (PoPPs). The IoT remote monitoring system employed a Microduino integrated with various supporting boards as a wearable device. Additionally, a Raspberry Pi was utilised as a base station or mobile gateway, while ThingSpeak served as the cloud platform. The monitoring system was developed with the purpose of assisting healthcare personnel in real time, remotely monitoring patients while engaging in one or more of the nine typical physical activities that are often prescribed to individuals participating in a prehabilitation program. Furthermore, an alert notification system was designed to notify the clinician and patient if the values were abnormal (i.e., the patient had not been active for many days). The integration of IOT and Raspberry Pi technology into a pre-operative prehabilitation program yielded a promising outcome with a success rate of 78%. Consequently, this intervention is expected to facilitate the resolution of challenges encountered by healthcare providers and patients, including extended waiting periods and constraints related to staffing and infrastructure. © 2023 by the authors."

Traditional diagnostic methods, while valuable, have inherent limitations, necessitating the exploration of innovative approaches. In this study, we delved into the analysis of grapho-phonological data as potential objective indicators of depression. Our research journey began with an analysis of an existing database, containing handwriting and drawing data from both healthy individuals and those diagnosed with depressive disorders. Leveraging this data, we developed machine learning models designed to distinguish between these two groups. Notably, we observed that models utilizing drawing-related features outperformed those relying on writing features. This section of our study highlights the potential of combining these data for enhanced depression detection. The creation of a new database is a noteworthy addition, providing grapho-phonological data (i.e., handwriting, drawing and laughter data) from healthy and depressed subjects. The analysis of these data sets reached peak performance, achieving superior accuracy values in comprehensive classification models, underscoring the potential of this multi-modal approaches. The study also presents a streamlined, non-invasive protocol that allows to efficiently gather essential grapho-phonological data, taking only approximately 7 min per participant. Moreover, our work introduces the “Voice & Drawing App”, an accessible tool enabling remote data collection for mental health assessment. This innovation aligns with telemonitoring trends and offers a user-friendly solution, whether within clinical settings or patients’ homes. An accelerometer-based inertial measurement units system (IMUs) to capture motion patterns has been introduced into the app. This choice is driven by the recognition of the valuable information encoded in psychomotor behaviour, that can serve as indicators of depression. Our study highlights promising avenues for future research, including expanding subject populations, implementing automatic laughter recognition, and incorporating video data to capture facial expressions. Wearable devices with IMUs offer exciting opportunities for comprehensive depression assessment. In summary, our research seeks to improve our understanding of depression by exploring innovative approaches that incorporate graphological signals, laughter, and IMUs.

Despite great advances, some drawbacks like the release of metal ions and exfoliation of catalysts from substrates still exist. Acid oxidation treatment, as a simple and effective way, is commonly used in the surface treatment of carbon materials, extensively used either directly as capacitive and catalytic electrodes or as the current collectors. However, its potential to be directly applied for electrochemical sensing has not been explored enough. In this work, a metal-free electrochemical sensor based on a surface oxygen-functionalized carbon cloth (CC) is fabricated through a simple acid oxidation treatment, during which more oxygen-containing groups are introduced, ensuring the solvent-accessible hydrophilic surface of electrodes and the improved surface interaction with dopamine. Our results suggest that the enhanced dopamine sensing performance can be obtained just through the introduction of oxygen-containing groups.

As ubiquitous computing applications, human activity recognition and localization have also been popularly worked on. These applications are used in healthcare monitoring, behavior analysis, personal safety, and entertainment. A robust model has been proposed in this article that works over IoT data extracted from smartphone and smartwatch sensors to recognize the activities performed by the user and, in the meantime, classify the location at which the human performed that particular activity. The system starts by denoising the input signal using a second-order Butterworth filter and then uses a hamming window to divide the signal into small data chunks. Multiple stacked windows are generated using three windows per stack, which, in turn, prove helpful in producing more reliable features. The stacked data are then transferred to two parallel feature extraction blocks, i.e., human activity recognition and human localization. The respective features are extracted for both modules that reinforce the system’s accuracy. A recursive feature elimination is applied to the features of both categories independently to select the most informative ones among them. After the feature selection, a genetic algorithm is used to generate ten different generations of each feature vector for data augmentation purposes, which directly impacts the system’s performance. Finally, a deep neural decision forest is trained for classifying the activity and the subject’s location while working on both of these attributes in parallel.

The Mandami fuzzy inference-based medical decision support system (FI-MDSS) was also developed using MATLAB to assist medical professionals in evaluating a patient’s health risk and deciding on the appropriate clinical intervention. The patient’s physiological measurements, EWS, and health risk category are stored on the Particle cloud and Thing Speak cloud platforms and can be accessed remotely and in real-time via the Internet. Furthermore, a RESTful application programming interface (API) was developed using GO language and PostgreSQL database to enhance data presentation and accessibility.

But, physical meetings are the biggest reason for the global pandemic. The healthcare industry is in a dire state of despair because of the spread of COVID, constrained health workers, and infrastructure. Healthcare accommodations are costlier than ever due to various reasons such as the global population getting busier and the rise in the number of chronic diseases. Nowadays, there is a high demand for healthcare support due to the increase in the aging population, the COVID-19 crisis, its postdisease difficulties, and other chronic diseases. Treating all the patients at hospitals is not practical nowadays due to limited healthcare facilities. The patients' care is all dependent on visits to the hospital physically, and to some extent, calls, text messages, and emails. This way it was not possible for the doctors to monitor the health of the patients continuously and assist them whenever needed. Recently, the Internet of Things (IoT) and various machine learning approaches have been widely explored in this sector. The IoT-based healthcare methods provide quality and efficiency during treatment. The IoT along with machine learning techniques can transform the healthcare industry by making it more accessible and less costly and make healthcare more facile by equipping the users with pocket amicable medical facilities. With IoT-enabled devices, remote monitoring can enable patients to better connect with doctors, thereby minimizing physical visits. It can equip doctors to easily keep track of their patient's health by utilizing wearables like fitness bands that can monitor various healthcare parameters. All these systems mostly use machine learning or deep learning approaches. This way, they will know whether to offer any immediate medical care or to make any changes to the current treatment.

These types of highly sensitive pressure sensors can be realized by designing micro-structure electrodes or dielectric layers on a wearable smart device. Herein, we prepare a flexible and conductive electrode through electrospinning of palladium ions (Pd2+)/polyacrylonitrile (PAN) solution and followed by electroless plating of the hybrid nanofibrous membranes. The FESEM images showed that the obtained conductive nanofibrous membrane was covered by a coral-like silver layer with porosity benefiting for excellent electrical conductivity. Based on the superior performance, it is used as the electrodes and jointly assembled into a full microporous structure sensor with the high-mesh nylon netting. Benefitting from the dramatically alterable contact area of the electrode and the good dielectricity of nylon netting, the as-prepared sensor exhibits a high sensitivity of 1.49 kPa−1, a fast response time of 48 ms, low hysteresis of 7.55% and stable durability over 1000 cycles. Besides, practical human motions’ detection is carried out by this wearable pressure sensor. The simulation of the finite elemental analysis is used to explain the mechanism of the sensor.

Many patients are relatively young, instructed, sensitive to new technologies, and professionally active when developing the first symptoms. Older patients usually require more time, encouragement, reinforcement and a closer support but, nevertheless, selecting user-friendly devices, provided earlier in the course of the disease, and engaging motivated carers may overcome many technological barriers. ALS may be considered a model for neurodegenerative diseases to further develop and test new technologies. From multidisciplinary teleconsults to telemonitoring of the respiratory function, telemedicine has the potentiality to embrace other fields, including nutrition, physical mobility, and the interaction with the environment. Brain-computer interfaces and eye tracking expanded the field of augmentative and alternative communication in ALS but their potentialities go beyond communication, to cognition and robotics. Virtual reality and different forms of artificial intelligence present further interesting possibilities that deserve to be investigated. COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented opportunity to speed up the development and implementation of new technologies in clinical practice, improving the daily living of both ALS patients and carers.

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in healthcare professionals making fundamental changes to the way healthcare is delivered and for patients and families adapting to these changes. Comprehensive remotely delivered, technology-based healthcare, closer to the patients home (reducing hospital footfall and possibly reducing carbon footprint) is likely to be one of the important collateral effects of the pandemic. Telemedicine is anticipated to impact everyone involved in healthcare - providers and patients alike. It is going to bring changes to organization, work areas and work culture in healthcare. Healthcare providers, policymakers and those accessing healthcare services will experience the impact of technology-based healthcare delivery. Telemedicine can play an exciting role in the management of childhood asthma by delivering high-quality care closer to the child's home. However, unlike adults, children still need to be accompanied by their carers for virtual care. Policymakers will need to take into account potential additional costs as well as the legal, ethical and cultural implications of large scale use of telemedicine. In this narrative review, we review evidence regarding the role of telemedicine and related emerging technologies in paediatric and adolescent asthma. Although there are gaps in the current knowledge, there is evidence demonstrating the important role of telemedicine in management of childhood and adolescent asthma.

This paper reports research that has been carried out in an academic pursuit for answers to queries encapsulating the social perception, impact and aftermath of breast cancer—affiliated healthcare systems, effective caregiving, healthy coping and holistic healing mechanisms. Objective The study aims at presenting the illness and its negative imprints as a cumulative concern, instead of singularly scrutinizing it through a clinical lens. It urges practitioners and caregivers to innovate and intervene at three identified and overlapping target phases of the journey: (i) awareness and diagnosis, (ii) short-term healing and (iii) long-term recovery. Methodology With underlying system design practices, this qualitative study was conducted as a part of a visual communication project under the graphic design department at National Institute of Design, Ahmedabad. The deployed methodology made use of empathy mapping, opportunity mapping, gigamaping, interviews and questionnaires as tools to engage the two stakeholder groups, one including health care providers, patients and their support systems personifying direct stakeholders of the journey and the second being a group of general participants embodying indirect stakeholders. Conclusion This approach devised cancer positive, a collective and curative movement, which provides a systemic solution to downsize the trauma of the illness, foster interpersonal relationships and eradicate the perceived and actual stigma attached to breast cancer. The proffered system provides strategies for accessible and responsive caregiving, remote monitoring, telemedicine and behavioural modification by proposing an allocated breast cancer data unit.

Urolithiasis is a clinically and socially significant disease that requires long-term follow-up in order to prevent stone recurrence. Currently, telemedicine consultations in the ""patient-doctor"" format are actively used in urology, however, the methodology, technological base and assessment of the efficiency of remote monitoring of the patient's health status are virtually not developed. Aim. To provide basics for the methodology of remote monitoring of patients with urolithiasis for detailed comprehensive examination and comprehensive metaphylaxis of recurrent stone formation. Materials and methods. A comprehensive clinical examination was carried out on the basis of the Institute of Urology and Human Reproductive Health, the National Medical Research Center on Urology and the Institute of Digital Medicine of FGAOU VO I.M. Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University during the period from 1st February to 1st December 2020. A total of 30 patients with urolithiasis were included in the study. Remote monitoring of health status was carried out using a portable analyzer ""ETTA AMP-01"" on dipstick. Data transmission was performed through a mobile application, which is part of the ""NetHealth"" information system (www.nethealth.ru). The values and frequency of urine tests performed by the patient independently, as well as patient satisfaction and adherence to the monitoring technology were evaluated. Analytical, clinical, sociological and statistical research methods were used. Results. By systematizing published data and our own clinical experience, we have developed a model for remote monitoring of the health status of patients with urinary stone disease, which included a system of indications and contraindications, a program and an order of the monitoring, as well as a basic technological solution (medical devices and a hardware-software complex). In this study, median duration of remote monitoring was 168 days. According to the questionnaire, general positive assessment and desire to continue telemonitoring was seen in 100.0% of cases, while 86.7% of patients positively evaluated the technical accessibility and reliability of the system and 93.3% considered the quality and availability of medical care as high. Conclusion. A methodology for remote monitoring of patients with urolithiasis has been developed with the aim of preventing recurrent stone formation. There was a high adherence of patients to remote monitoring with a tendency to decrease in values after 4 and 6 months. During these periods, it is necessary to carry out routine consultations by the physician who appointed remote monitoring in order to continue the follow-up program. There was a high satisfaction of patients with remote monitoring, and they pointed out the quality and availability of urological care owing to telemedicine technologies. © 2021, Bionika Media Ltd..

And now when the whole world is facing the rapid expansion of COVID-19, where the social and physical distancing is a matter of concern for the frontline clinical healthcare provider and the patients, Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) had played an indispensable role in tackling COVID-19. It not only accelerates our response to this widespread pandemic but also offers many innovative solutions to retaliate this global issue. Remote monitoring and evaluating of large number COVID-19 patients in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or in ventilators by few medical health professionals, providing telemedicine services to the people dwelling in lockdown or quarantine, and encouraging behavioral modification of patients; has opened the door to more efficient healthcare delivery during this time of ‘New Normal’. With new technology, however comes new challenges which have to fix together to make this technology works more efficiently, especially in the rural areas, where it needs the most. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."

Implantable medical device (IMD) is an example of such an IoMT-enabled device. IMDs treat the patient’s health and give a mechanism to provide regular remote monitoring to the healthcare providers. However, the current wireless communication channels can curb the security and privacy of these devices by allowing an attacker to interfere with both the data and communication. The privacy and security breaches in IMDs have thereby alarmed both the health providers and government agencies. Ensuring security of these small devices is a vital task to prevent severe health consequences to the bearer. The attacks can range from system to infrastructure levels where both the software and hardware of the IMD are compromised. In the recent years, biometric and cryptographic approaches to authentication, machine learning approaches to anomaly detection and external wearable devices for wireless communication protection have been proposed. However, the existing solutions for wireless medical devices are either heavy for memory constrained devices or require additional devices to be worn. To treat the present situation, there is a requirement to facilitate effective and secure data communication by introducing policies that will incentivize the development of security techniques. This paper proposes a novel electrocardiogram authentication scheme which uses Legendre approximation coupled with multi-layer perceptron model for providing three levels of security for data, network and application levels. The proposed model can reach up to 99.99% testing accuracy in identifying the authorized personnel even with 5 coefficients. © 2018, The Natural Computing Applications Forum."

The current model for chronic AF management (favouring infrequent hospital visits) in combination with the challenge of detecting cardiac arrythmias provides opportunity for wearable devices to improve quality of care. Physicians must be aware of available wearable devices, their accuracy, validity, and potential to improve patient care. Methods: PubMed and Google Scholar databases were searched for primary studies involving AF and wearable devices published from database inception to 2020. Due to the heterogeneity of the findings, quantitative synthesis of the information could not be conducted. A narrative synthesis was performed for the obtained results, including a discussion of apparent trends and common study outcome measures: sensitivity, specificity, positive-, and negative-predictive-values. The narrative included comparisons to similar reviews and a discussion on both the current and future research directions. Results: The systematic search produced 214 studies, of which, 7 met the pre-determined eligibility criteria. The studies were published between 2018-2020 in 5 countries. Each eligible study was described and summarized; devices investigated include the Apple Watch with Kardia Band (Atrial fibrillation-sensing watch; AFSW), Huawei wearable devices (Honor 4 wristband, Honor Watch or Watch GT), CardioTracker (CART) + a pulse oximeter, and the RITMA system. Discussion: This systematic review comprehensively examined wearable devices used to deliver care for patients with AF. It was found that currently available wearable technologies for AF detection and management varied greatly in their accuracy, application settings, and accessibility. With technological advancements and further exploration into AF devices’ usability, widespread implementation of wearable technology in AF care is plausible. Successful application of these technologies can improve AF care and contribute to a significant reduction in AF-related healthcare costs. Conclusion: There are many devices available for AF care that show promise for certain applications. Additionally, there remains a demand for large-scale, high-quality research in this field to investigate the advantages and shortcomings of various devices that have shown promise in preliminary research. Future research should focus on randomized controlled trials to generate conclusive findings for wearable technologies in AF. © Ervis Musa, Adam Z. Levitan, Gavin Hughes. (2021)."
