2) categorizing the data into groups (comfortable and uncomfortable) based on the fluctuations in the data; and 3) alerting the caregiver about the condition of the patient. experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of i-sheet in monitoring the health of the patient. i-sheet effectively categorizes the condition of the patient with an accuracy of 99.3% and utilizes 17.5 w of the power. furthermore, the delay involved in monitoring the health of patients using i-sheet is 2 s which is very diminutive and is acceptable."}, {"year": "2024", "venue": "2024 ieee 9th international conference for convergence in technology (i2ct)", "doi": "10.1109/i2ct61223.2024.10544004", "authors": "r. raman;
