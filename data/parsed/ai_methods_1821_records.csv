While standardized neuropsychological tests are inconvenient for this purpose, wearable sensor technology collecting physiological and behavioral data looks promising to provide proxy measures of cognitive function. The objective of this study was to evaluate the predictive ability of digital physiological features, based on sensor data from wrist-worn wearables, in determining neuropsychological test scores in individuals with MCI. Methods: We used the dataset collected from a 10-week single-arm clinical trial in older adults (50–70 years old) diagnosed with amnestic MCI (N = 30) who received a digitally delivered multidomain therapeutic intervention. Cognitive performance was assessed before and after the intervention using the Neuropsychological Test Battery (NTB) from which composite scores were calculated (executive function, processing speed, immediate memory, delayed memory and global cognition). The Empatica E4, a wrist-wearable medical-grade device, was used to collect physiological data including blood volume pulse, electrodermal activity, and skin temperature. We processed sensors’ data and extracted a range of physiological features. We used interpolated NTB scores for 10-day intervals to test predictability of scores over short periods and to leverage the maximum of wearable data available. In addition, we used individually centered data which represents deviations from personal baselines. Supervised machine learning was used to train models predicting NTB scores from digital physiological features and demographics. Performance was evaluated using “leave-one-subject-out” and “leave-one-interval-out” cross-validation. Results: The final sample included 96 aggregated data intervals from 17 individuals. In total, 106 digital physiological features were extracted. We found that physiological features, especially measures of heart rate variability, correlated most strongly to the executive function compared to other cognitive composites. The model predicted the actual executive function scores with correlation r = 0.69 and intra-individual changes in executive function scores with r = 0.61. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrated that wearable-based physiological measures, primarily HRV, have potential to be used for the continuous assessments of cognitive function in individuals with MCI."

Beyond these triggers, the impact of ambient environment on pain occurrence and intensity has not been investigated. This study explores the impact of environmental factors on the frequency and severity of breakthrough cancer pain (BTCP) in the home context from the perspective of patients with advanced cancer and their primary family caregiver. Methods: A health monitoring system was deployed in the homes of patient and family caregiver dyads to collect self-reported pain events and contextual environmental data (light, temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, ambient noise.) Correlation analysis examined the relationship between environmental factors with: 1) individually reported pain episodes and 2) overall pain trends in a 24-hour time window. Machine learning models were developed to explore how environmental factors may predict BTCP episodes. Results: Variability in correlation strength between environmental variables and pain reports among dyads was found. Light and noise show moderate association (r = 0.50–0.70) in 66% of total deployments. The strongest correlation for individual pain events involved barometric pressure (r = 0.90); for pain trends over 24-hours the strongest correlations involved humidity (r = 0.84) and barometric pressure (r = 0.83). Machine learning achieved 70% BTCP prediction accuracy. Conclusion: Our study provides insights into the role of ambient environmental factors in BTCP and offers novel opportunities to inform personalized pain management strategies, remotely support patients and their caregivers in self-symptom management. This research provides preliminary evidence of the impact of ambient environmental factors on BTCP in the home setting. We utilized real-world data and correlation analysis to provide an understanding of the relationship between environmental factors and cancer pain which may be helpful to others engaged in similar work."

For this information to be interpretable, machine learning (ML) processes are necessary. Research question: Can a machine learning model successfully identify patients expected to have low gait speed in the early recovery period following joint replacement surgery? Methods: A commercial database from a smartphone-based care management platform passively collecting mobility data pre- and post-lower limb arthroplasty was used. We sought to create a ML model to predict gait speed recovery curves and identify patients at risk of poor gait speed outcome, a measure associated with range of motion and patient-reported outcomes. Model performance including sensitivity, specificity, precision, and accuracy were determined. Receiver operator curve (ROC) analysis was used to compare true and false positive rates. To benchmark our model, we compared threshold-based notifications based on the patient's current gait speed. Results: The performance of the predictive model was significantly improved compared to baseline of threshold-based exceptions using current gait speed. The ML model currently provides 53 % precision, 88 % accuracy, 36 % sensitivity, and 95 % specificity on the held-out test set. The ROC analysis suggests good clinical performance (AUC=0.81). Significance: Utilization of ML to predict gait recovery following total joint replacement is feasible and provides results with excellent specificity. This model will allow inclusion of additional data for retraining as patient populations evolve. Clinician feedback regarding notifications, including resulting actions and outcomes, can be used to further inform the model and improve clinical utility."

Herein, a tough, self-healing, adhesive double network (DN) conductive hydrogel (named as OSA-(Gelatin/PAM)-Ca, O-(G/P)-Ca) was prepared by bridging gelatin and polyacrylamide network with functionalized polysaccharide (oxidized sodium alginate, OSA) through Schiff base reaction. Thanks to the presence of multiple interactions (Schiff base bond, hydrogen bond, and metal coordination) within the network, the prepared hydrogel showed outstanding mechanical properties (tensile strain of 2800 % and stress of 630 kPa), high conductivity (0.72 S/m), repeatable adhesion performance and excellent self-healing ability (83.6 %/79.0 % of the original tensile strain/stress after self-healing). Moreover, the hydrogel-based sensor exhibited high strain sensitivity (GF = 3.66) and fast response time (<0.5 s), which can be used to monitor a wide range of human physiological signals. Based on this, excellent compression sensitivity (GF = 0.41 kPa−1 in the range of 90–120 kPa), a three-dimensional (3D) array of flexible sensor was designed to monitor the intensity of pressure and spatial force distribution.

Such technology can have a significant impact on health screening, chronic disease management and remote monitoring. A common approach is to collect sensor data and corresponding labels from a clinical grade device (e.g., blood pressure cuff) and train deep learning models to map one to the other. Although well intentioned, this approach often ignores a principled analysis of whether the input sensor data have enough information to predict the desired metric. We analyze the task of predicting blood pressure from PPG pulse wave analysis. Our review of the prior work reveals that many papers fall prey to data leakage and unrealistic constraints on the task and preprocessing steps. We propose a set of tools to help determine if the input signal in question (e.g., PPG) is indeed a good predictor of the desired label (e.g., blood pressure). Using our proposed tools, we found that blood pressure prediction using PPG has a high multi-valued mapping factor of 33.2% and low mutual information of 9.8%. In comparison, heart rate prediction using PPG, a well-established task, has a very low multi-valued mapping factor of 0.75% and high mutual information of 87.7%. We argue that these results provide a more realistic representation of the current progress toward the goal of wearable blood pressure measurement via PPG pulse wave analysis.

Electrocardiographic artificial intelligence (ECG-AI) models for FCHD risk prediction using ECG data from wearable devices could enable wider screening/monitoring efforts. Objectives: To develop a single-lead ECG–based deep learning model for FCHD risk prediction and assess concordance between clinical and Apple Watch ECGs. Methods: An FCHD single-lead (“lead I” from 12-lead ECGs) ECG-AI model was developed using 167,662 ECGs (50,132 patients) from the University of Tennessee Health Sciences Center. Eighty percent of the data (5-fold cross-validation) was used for training and 20% as a holdout. Cox proportional hazards (CPH) models incorporating ECG-AI predictions with age, sex, and race were also developed. The models were tested on paired clinical single-lead and Apple Watch ECGs from 243 St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study participants. The correlation and concordance of the predictions were assessed using Pearson correlation (R), Spearman correlation (ρ), and Cohen's kappa. Results: The ECG-AI and CPH models resulted in AUC = 0.76 and 0.79, respectively, on the 20% holdout and AUC = 0.85 and 0.87 on the Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist external validation data. There was moderate-strong positive correlation between predictions (R = 0.74, ρ = 0.67, and κ = 0.58) when tested on the 243 paired ECGs. The clinical (lead I) and Apple Watch predictions led to the same low/high-risk FCHD classification for 99% of the participants. CPH prediction correlation resulted in an R = 0.81, ρ = 0.76, and κ = 0.78. Conclusion: Risk of FCHD can be predicted from single-lead ECGs obtained from wearable devices and are statistically concordant with lead I of a 12-lead ECG."

An objective measure of joint swelling via the previously reported automated detection of dorsal finger fold patterns from hand photographs, could enhance RPM accuracy in RA. Objectives: To test the quality of automated detection of finger joint swelling based on finger fold recognition in sequentially taken hand photos of RA patients during regular rheumatology consultations. Methods: We utilized various image recognition models (Canny Edge Detection, Ridge Detection) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on photos of 1,783 Proximal Interphalangeal (PIP) joints from RA patients. After keypoint detection in hand photos via MediaPipe, PIP joints were isolated for further analysis. The CNN, trained on an additional 151 PIP images using LinkNet and Python 3.10, helped quantify finger folds and PIP joint diameters at the pixel level. The Finger Fold Index (FFI) was calculated as the ratio of joint diameter to the mean pixel length of detected finger folds. We analyzed 74 smartphone images (iPhone 6 camera without flash) of 17 RA patients taken in ≥2 regular consultations at a Swiss Academic Center. Active disease in at least one visit with congruent hand imaging as well as recorded swollen and tender joint counts and DAS28-CRP scores were required. We describe misclassifications based on algorithm steps (cropping, diameter, folds, image quality) or clinical data. Results: Only PIP2-4 joints were suitable for analysis due to oblique positioning of digits 1 and 5. The algorithm initially captured 222 PIP joints. Of those, 32% were optimally processed in terms of cropping, diameter, and finger fold recognition. The main reason for misclassifications were poor image quality leading to suboptimal cropping (9%), diameter recognition (18%), and incorrect finger fold identification (5%). In 15% of joints, the algorithm failed to provide results. For FFI correlation with joint swelling and DAS28- CRP evolution, seven patients (mean age 53, range 27-70) where monitored across 18 visits, yielding 31 hand images (either one or both hands). The average FFIs were 2.3 (index finger), 2.1 (middle finger), and 2.4 (ring finger). In 71% of patients (5 out of 7), the FFI correlated with disease progression as indicated by DAS28-CRP changes or swollen joint count. One of the most common confounding factors affecting the FFI was the reappearance of small finger folds after the swelling subsided, which inaccurately inflated the FFI measurements. In repeated analyses of healthy hand images, we found that light conditions (flash yes/no, sufficient light), positioning of the camera (maintaining a vertical perspective/deviating from a strictly overhead position). Conclusion: Longitudinal finger fold recognition and FFI measurement in a real-world setting shows consistent results with DAS28-CRP and or swelling and pain on a single joint level. Insufficient image quality was an important cause for misinterpretation in this real-world setting. Improved quality via the use of flash, photo boxes and further training of the algorithm may lead to a higher accuracy for the detection of disease flares or resolution, whereas the DAS28 may not be the ideal gold standard for joint swelling. ."

The study analyzes data extracted from multiple vital signs and other contextual information for diagnostic purposes. The daily data collection process encounters sampling constraints due to weekends, holidays, shift changes, staff turnover, and equipment breakdowns, resulting in numerous nulls, repeated readings, outliers, and meaningless values. The short time series generated also pose a challenge to analysis, preventing the extraction of seasonal information or consistent trends. Blind data collection results in most of the data coming from periods when residents are healthy, resulting in excessively imbalanced data. This study proposes a data cleaning process and then builds a mechanism that reproduces the basal activity of the residents to improve the classification of the disease. The results show that the proposed basal module-assisted machine learning techniques allow anticipating diagnostics 2, 3 or 4 days before doctors decide to start treatment with antibiotics, achieving a performance measured by the area-under-the-curve metric of 0.857. The contributions of this work are: (1) a new data cleaning process; (2) the analysis of contextual information to improve data quality; (3) the generation of a baseline measure for relative comparison; and (4) the use of either binary (disease/no disease) or multiclass classification, differentiating among types of infections and showing the advantages of multiclass versus binary classification.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the efficacy of an artificial intelligence-based heart failure detection model for peripartum cardiomyopathy detection. STUDY DESIGN: We first built a deep-learning model for heart failure detection using retrospective data at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center. Cases were adult and nonpregnant female patients with a heart failure diagnosis; controls were adult nonpregnant female patients without heart failure. The model was then tested on an independent cohort of pregnant women at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center with or without peripartum cardiomyopathy. We also tested the model in an external cohort of pregnant women at Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist. Key outcomes were assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. We also repeated our analysis using only lead I electrocardiogram as an input to assess the feasibility of remote monitoring via wearables that can capture single-lead electrocardiogram data. RESULTS: The University of Tennessee Health Science Center heart failure cohort comprised 346,339 electrocardiograms from 142,601 patients. In this cohort, 60% of participants were Black and 37% were White, with an average age (standard deviation) of 53 (19) years. The heart failure detection model achieved an area under the curve of 0.92 on the holdout set. We then tested the ability of the heart failure model to detect peripartum cardiomyopathy in an independent University of Tennessee Health Science Center cohort of pregnant women and an external Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist cohort of pregnant women. The independent University of Tennessee Health Science Center cohort included 158 electrocardiograms from 115 patients; our deep-learning model achieved an area under the curve of 0.83 (0.77–0.89) for this data set. The external Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist cohort involved 80 electrocardiograms from 43 patients; our deep-learning model achieved an area under the curve of 0.94 (0.91–0.98) for this data set. For identifying peripartum cardiomyopathy diagnosed ≥10 days after delivery, the model achieved an area under the curve of 0.88 (0.81–0.94) for the University of Tennessee Health Science Center cohort and of 0.96 (0.93–0.99) for the Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist cohort. When we repeated our analysis by building a heart failure detection model using only lead-I electrocardiograms, we obtained similarly high detection accuracies, with areas under the curve of 0.73 and 0.93 for the University of Tennessee Health Science Center and Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist cohorts, respectively. CONCLUSION: Artificial intelligence can accurately detect peripartum cardiomyopathy from electrocardiograms alone. A simple electrocardiographic artificial intelligence–based peripartum screening could result in a timelier diagnosis. Given that results with 1-lead electrocardiogram data were similar to those obtained using all 12 leads, future studies will focus on remote screening for peripartum cardiomyopathy using smartwatches that can capture single-lead electrocardiogram data."

The latter are currently generally inserted inside defibrillators or resynchronization systems, or inserted inside the pulmonary circulation for monitoring pulmonary pressure. Parameters such as thoracic impedance, physical activity, heart rate variability, atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, blood pressure, and O2 saturation can be controlled remotely. The data relating to the actual benefit in terms of avoidable events (death and hospitalizations) are not definitive, but certainly from an organizational point of view, the benefit is evident, both on the part of the patient and of the organization of care. The latter, provided in the form of televisits, requires a re-modulation of the system, making use of trained personnel, a well- structured network, and digital technologies (platforms, electronic health records) that are not yet perfectly developed. The evolution of the solutions offered by artificial intelligence guarantees a rapid and progressive refinement of telemedicine in this sector."

Medical infrastructure, which for decades sought to reduce the incidence and severity of communicable diseases, has proven insufficient in meeting the intensive, long-term monitoring needs of many NCD disease patient groups. In addition, existing portable devices with rigid electronics are still limited in clinical use due to unreliable data, limited functionality, and lack of continuous measurement ability. Here, a wearable system for at-home cardiovascular monitoring of postpartum women-a group with urgently unmet NCD needs in the United States-using a cloud-integrated soft sternal device with conformal nanomembrane sensors is introduced. A supporting mobile application provides device data to a custom cloud architecture for real-time waveform analytics, including medical device-grade blood pressure prediction via deep learning, and shares the results with both patient and clinician to complete a robust and highly scalable remote monitoring ecosystem. Validated in a month-long clinical study with 20 postpartum Black women, the system demonstrates its ability to remotely monitor existing disease progression, stratify patient risk, and augment clinical decision-making by informing interventions for groups whose healthcare needs otherwise remain unmet in standard clinical practice."

Despite a growing arsenal of targeted medications, many rheumatology patients fail to achieve full remission. Assessing disease activity remains challenging, as patients prioritize different symptoms and disease phenotypes vary. This is also reflected in clinical trials where the efficacy of drugs is not necessarily measured in an optimal way with the traditional outcome assessment. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has catalyzed a digital transformation in healthcare, embracing telemonitoring and patient-reported data via apps and wearables. As a further driver of digital medicine, electronic medical record (EMR) providers are actively engaged in developing algorithms for clinical decision support, heralding a shift towards patient-centered, decentralized care. Machine learning algorithms have emerged as valuable tools for handling the increasing volume of patient data, promising to enhance treatment quality and patient well-being. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are particularly promising for radiological image analysis, aiding in the detection of specific lesions such as erosions, sacroiliitis, or osteoarthritis, with several FDA-approved applications. Clinical predictions, including numerical disease activity forecasts and medication choices, offer the potential to optimize treatment strategies. Numeric predictions can be integrated into clinical workflows, allowing for shared decision making with patients. Clustering patients based on disease characteristics provides a personalized care approach. Digital biomarkers, such as patient-reported outcomes and wearables data, offer insights into disease progression and therapy response more flexibly and outside patient consultations. In association with patient-reported outcomes, disease-specific digital biomarkers via image recognition or single-camera motion capture enables more efficient remote patient monitoring. Digital biomarkers may also play a major role in clinical trials in the future as continuous, disease-specific outcome measurement facilitating decentralized studies. Prediction models can help with patient selection in clinical trials, such as by predicting high disease activity. Efforts are underway to integrate these advancements into clinical workflows using digital pathways and remote patient monitoring platforms. In summary, machine learning, digital biomarkers, and advanced imaging technologies hold immense promise for enhancing clinical decision support and clinical trials in rheumatology.

Current diagnosis relies on subjective lung auscultation by physicians. Enabling this capability via a low-profile, objective wearable device for remote patient monitoring (RPM) could offer pre-emptive, accurate respiratory data to patients. With this goal as our aim, we used a low-profile accelerometer-based wearable system that utilizes deep learning to objectively detect wheezing along with respiration rate using a single sensor. The miniature patch consists of a sensitive wideband MEMS accelerometer and low-noise CMOS interface electronics on a small board, which was then placed on nine conventional lung auscultation sites on the patient’s chest walls to capture the pulmonary-induced vibrations (PIVs). A deep learning model was developed and compared with a deterministic time–frequency method to objectively detect wheezing in the PIV signals using data captured from 52 diverse patients with respiratory diseases. The wearable accelerometer patch, paired with the deep learning model, demonstrated high fidelity in capturing and detecting respiratory wheezes and patterns across diverse and pertinent settings. It achieved accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 95%, 96%, and 93%, respectively, with an AUC of 0.99 on the test set—outperforming the deterministic time–frequency approach.

Artificial intelligence (AI) emerges as a promising tool to identify definitive predictors for ankle sprains. This paper aims to summarize the use of AI in investigating the ankle biomechanics of healthy and subjects with ankle sprains. Methods: Articles published between 2010 and 2023 were searched from five electronic databases. 59 papers were included for analysis with regards to: i). types of motion tested (functional vs. purposeful ankle movement); ii) types of biomechanical parameters measured (kinetic vs kinematic); iii) types of sensor systems used (lab-based vs field-based); and, iv) AI techniques used. Findings: Most studies (83.1%) examined biomechanics during functional motion. Single kinematic parameter, specifically ankle range of motion, could obtain accuracy up to 100% in identifying injury status. Wearable sensor exhibited high reliability for use in both laboratory and on-field/clinical settings. AI algorithms primarily utilized electromyography and joint angle information as input data. Support vector machine was the most used supervised learning algorithm (18.64%), while artificial neural network demonstrated the highest accuracy in eight studies.

Wearable devices enable measurement of activity levels, and may offer additional prognostic information for prediction of survival in addition to traditionally used clinicopathological features. Materials & Methods: The iROC randomized trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03049410) compared recovery following intracorporeal robot-assisted RC (iRARC) vs open RC (ORC) for bladder cancer. Physical activity levels were collected by calculating the maximum number of steps per day and average steps per day over a 7-day period using a wrist-worn wearable device at baseline and 12 weeks postoperatively. Stamina was measured using the 30-second chair to stand assessment at baseline and 12 weeks post-operatively. Clinicopathological data such as age, gender, BMI, pathological T-stage and surgical margin status were collected during the peri-operative period. Cross-sectional imaging during follow-up was used to determine recurrence-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS) was collected up to 18 months. Results: Among 338 patients in the iROC trial, 319 patients received RC. OS and RFS following RC was 87% (n=278) and 82% (n=262) respectively over a median follow-up of 33 months. Wearable device data was available for 165 patients for analysis. There was no significant difference in maximum step-counts at baseline (mean 9388, SD 4552) when compared with 3-months post-operatively (mean 8792, SD 4055). Using clinicopathological features, we demonstrated an AUC of 74% to predict RFS which improved to 76% with the addition of activity and stamina data. For prediction of OS, using clinicopathological features demonstrated an AUC of 71% which improved to 81% with the addition of activity and stamina data. Kaplan Meier analysis with patients divided into low and high risk groups by the final model showed an increased RFS (99% vs 59%) and OS (98% vs 53%) in 33 months after surgery. Conclusions: Wearable device and stamina data may offer additional prognostic information which could supplement traditional clinicopathological features. With modern wearable devices, continuous activity data supplemented with heart rate data may further improve clinical models to predict RFS and OS. [Figure presented]"

The viscoelastic strain of stretchable materials often results in nonlinear stress-strain characteristics over a broad range of strains, consequently making the stretchable sensors at the body joints less accurate in predicting and recognizing human gestures. Accurate recognition of human gestures can be further deteriorated by environmental changes such as temperature and humidity. Here, we demonstrated an environment-adaptable high stress-strain linearity (up to ε = 150%) and high-durability (>100,000 cycles) stretchable sensor conformally laminated onto the body joints for human gesture recognition. The serpentine configuration of our ionic liquid-based stretchable film enabled us to construct broad data sets of mechanical strain and temperature changes for machine learning-based gesture recognition. Signal recognition and training of distinct strains and environmental stimuli using a machine learning-based algorithm analysis successfully measured and predicted the joint motion in a temperature-changing environment with an accuracy of 92.86% (R-squared).

Despite the immense potential for rehabilitation and exercise to help people with disabilities live longer, healthier, and more independent lives, people with disabilities can experience physical, psychosocial, environmental, and economic barriers that limit their ability to participate in rehabilitation, exercise, and other physical activities. Together, these barriers contribute to health inequities in people with disabilities, by disproportionately limiting their ability to participate in health-promoting physical activities, relative to people without disabilities. Therefore, there is great need for research and innovation focusing on the development of strategies to expand accessibility and promote participation in rehabilitation and exercise programs for people with disabilities. Here, we discuss how cutting-edge technologies related to telecommunications, wearables, virtual and augmented reality, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing are providing new opportunities to improve accessibility in rehabilitation and exercise for people with disabilities.

Epilepsy, a chronic brain syndrome characterized by recurrent, unpredictable attacks, affects individuals of all ages. IoT-based seizure monitoring can greatly enhance seizure patients' quality of life. IoT device acquires patient data and transmits it to a computer program so that doctors can examine it. Currently, doctors invest significant manual effort in inspecting Electroencephalograph (EEG) signals to identify seizure activity. However, EEG-based seizure detection algorithms face challenges in real-world scenarios due to non-stationary EEG data and variable seizure patterns among patients and recording sessions. Therefore, a sophisticated computer-based approach is necessary to analyze complex EEG records. In this work, the authors proposed a hybrid approach by combining traditional convolution neural (CN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) along with an attention mechanism for the automatic recognition of epileptic seizures through EEG signal analysis. This attention mechanism focuses on significant subsets of EEG data for class recognition, resulting in improved model performance. The proposed methods are evaluated using a publicly available UCI epileptic seizure recognition dataset, which consists of five classes: four normal conditions and one abnormal seizure condition. Experimental results demonstrate that the suggested approach achieves an overall accuracy of 97.05% for the five-class EEG recognition data, with an accuracy of 99.52% for binary classification distinguishing seizure cases from normal instances. Furthermore, the proposed intelligent seizure recognition model is compatible with an IoMT (Internet of Medical Things) cloud-based smart healthcare framework."

However, the adoption of and adherence to this therapy have been limited by the need for complex delivery devices and specialized care as well as resource consumption, posing challenges for new physicians. Thailand is a unique example of a developing nation that has successfully implemented and continued the use of this therapy by employing cooperative technology that has dramatically enhanced apomorphine delivery services. Methods: Establishing apomorphine delivery services requires significant resources and step-by-step solutions. We began our services by implementing various strategies in three chronological stages: the initial stage (2013–2015), intermediate stage (2016–2019), and current stage (2020–present), each presenting unique challenges. Together, we also implemented a proposed set of five mottos to strengthen our apomorphine delivery service. Using additive technology, we developed a patient registry platform that combined electronic data acquisition, video and remote monitoring using wearable sensors, and in-house mobile applications to support our service. Results: At the initial stage, we assembled a team to enhance the efficacy and confirm the safety of apomorphine treatment in our hospital. At the intermediate stage, we expanded our apomorphine delivery services beyond just the patients at our hospital. We supported other hospitals in Thailand in setting up their own apomorphine services by educating both physicians and nurses regarding apomorphine therapy. With this educational undertaking, increased apomorphine-related knowledge among medical professionals, and a greater number of hospitals providing apomorphine services, an increasing number of patients were administered apomorphine in subsequent years. Currently, we are providing effective apomorphine delivery to improve patient outcomes and are seamlessly integrating technology into clinical practice. Incorporating integrative technologies in our apomorphine delivery program yielded positive results in data collection and support throughout patient care, in tracking patients’ statuses, in the long-term use of this treatment, and in increasing medication adherence rates. Conclusion: This perspective paper describes how technology can help provide supportive healthcare services in resource-constrained environments, such as in Thailand, offering a step-by-step approach to overcoming several limitations.

However, assessments of postural instability, known as postural sway, leverage force platforms or wearable accelerometers, and are most often conducted in laboratory environments and are thus not broadly accessible. Remote measures of postural sway captured during daily life may provide a more accessible alterative, but their ability to capture disease status and fall risk has not yet been established. We explored the utility of remote measures of postural sway in a sample of 33 PwMS. Remote measures of sway differed significantly from lab-based measures, but still demonstrated moderately strong associations with patient-reported measures of balance and mobility impairment. Machine learning models for predicting fall risk trained on lab data provided an Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.79, while remote data only achieved an AUC of 0.51. Remote model performance improved to an AUC of 0.74 after a new, subject-specific k-means clustering approach was applied for identifying the remote data most appropriate for modelling. This cluster-based approach for analyzing remote data also strengthened associations with patient-reported measures, increasing their strength above those observed in the lab.

Machine learning allows to automate sleep stage classification, but trust and reliability issues have hampered its adoption in clinical applications. Estimating uncertainty is a crucial factor in enhancing reliability by identifying regions of heightened and diminished confidence. In this study, we used an uncertainty-centred machine learning pipeline, U-PASS, to automate sleep staging in a challenging real-world dataset of single-channel electroencephalography and accelerometry collected with a wearable device from an elderly population. We were able to effectively limit the uncertainty of our machine learning model and to reliably inform clinical experts of which predictions were uncertain to improve the machine learning model's reliability. This increased the five-stage sleep-scoring accuracy of a state-of-the-art machine learning model from 63.9% to 71.2% on our dataset. Remarkably, the machine learning approach outperformed the human expert in interpreting these wearable data. Manual review by sleep specialists, without specific training for sleep staging on wearable electroencephalography, proved ineffective. The clinical utility of this automated remote monitoring system was also demonstrated, establishing a strong correlation between the predicted sleep parameters and the reference polysomnography parameters, and reproducing known correlations with the apnea–hypopnea index.

It has been shown to improve psychological and physiological function across populations. However, a means to remotely use and monitor this approach would allow for wider use of this technique. Advancements in wearable and digital technology present an opportunity for the widespread application of this approach. Objective: The primary aim of the study was to determine the feasibility of fully remote, self-administered short sessions of HRV-directed biofeedback in a diverse population of health care workers (HCWs). The secondary aim was to determine whether a fully remote, HRV-directed biofeedback intervention significantly alters longitudinal HRV over the intervention period, as monitored by wearable devices. The tertiary aim was to estimate the impact of this intervention on metrics of psychological well-being. Methods: To determine whether remotely implemented short sessions of HRV biofeedback can improve autonomic metrics and psychological well-being, we enrolled HCWs across 7 hospitals in New York City in the United States. They downloaded our study app, watched brief educational videos about HRV biofeedback, and used a well-studied HRV biofeedback program remotely through their smartphone. HRV biofeedback sessions were used for 5 minutes per day for 5 weeks. HCWs were then followed for 12 weeks after the intervention period. Psychological measures were obtained over the study period, and they wore an Apple Watch for at least 7 weeks to monitor the circadian features of HRV. Results: In total, 127 HCWs were enrolled in the study. Overall, only 21 (16.5%) were at least 50% compliant with the HRV biofeedback intervention, representing a small portion of the total sample. This demonstrates that this study design does not feasibly result in adequate rates of compliance with the intervention. Numerical improvement in psychological metrics was observed over the 17-week study period, although it did not reach statistical significance (all P>.05). Using a mixed effect cosinor model, the mean midline-estimating statistic of rhythm (MESOR) of the circadian pattern of the SD of the interbeat interval of normal sinus beats (SDNN), an HRV metric, was observed to increase over the first 4 weeks of the biofeedback intervention in HCWs who were at least 50% compliant. Conclusions: In conclusion, we found that using brief remote HRV biofeedback sessions and monitoring its physiological effect using wearable devices, in the manner that the study was conducted, was not feasible. This is considering the low compliance rates with the study intervention. We found that remote short sessions of HRV biofeedback demonstrate potential promise in improving autonomic nervous function and warrant further study.

Hours with normal physical functioning without evidence of SCC (regular hours) were presented to a deep neural network that was trained by a self-supervised contrastive learning objective to extract features from the time series that are typical in regular periods. The model was used to calculate a SCC-Score that measures the dissimilarity to regular features. Detection and prediction performance of the SCC-Score was compared to clinical documentation of SCC (AUROC ± SD). In total 124 clinically documented SCC occurred in the IC, 16 in the OC. Detection of SCC was achieved in the IC with a sensitivity of 79.7% and specificity of 87.9%, with AUROC of 0.91 ± 0.01 (OC sensitivity 77.4%, specificity 81.8%, AUROC 0.87 ± 0.02). Prediction of infectious SCC was possible up to 2 days before clinical diagnosis (AUROC 0.90 at −24 h and 0.88 at −48 h). We provide proof of principle for the detection and prediction of SCC in patients treated for hematological malignancies using wearable data and a deep learning model. As a consequence, remote patient monitoring may enable pre-emptive complication management."

Shifting the administration model to the outpatient setting may improve patient experience, optimize hospital bed utilization and decrease costs, but requires an objective and reliable method for CRS detection to monitor patients remotely and safely. The feasibility of using a wearable device for detecting CRS following CAR-T therapy in RRMM was compared to standard of care (SoC) nursing-recorded vital signs in this investigator initiated clinical trial (IIT). Patients wore a wearable device that collected continuous measures of temperature, pulse, respiratory rate, and O2 saturation in addition to SoC while receiving CAR-T therapy from the day infusion to discharge. Changes in vital signs captured by the device were analyzed based on 2 thresholds: (i) CRS timestamps were tagged in wearable data when pt's temperature breached a fixed threshold of 38 0C ( Tf) defined as fever by the American Society of Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT), and (ii) when pt's temperature breached an individualized threshold of 2 standard deviations above their baseline temperature ( Ti) [see Figure 1]. Outcomes were time to first detection of CRS in wearable data vs. SoC. Wearable adherence was the duration pts wore the device over the total monitoring period. To date, 34 pts were screened, 28 enrolled (82.3% uptake), 1 was excluded from the dataset because of concurrent COVID-19, and 2 pts with CRS were excluded from time to detection comparison because of wearable adherence <50% during high-risk windows (defined as the time period where CRS is expected per known data for the CAR-T product). Max CRS grades were 1 (17 pts), 2 (1 pt), 3 (2 pts), and 4 (1 pt); 5 pts did not have clinical CRS. Patients wore the device for a median of 13 (12-15) days out of a median of 15.5 (14-17) days of inpatient admission for CAR-T infusion. Median individualized temperature threshold was 37.4 (37-37.6) C. Wearable adherence was 64 (51 - 77) % and 72 (57 - 87) % for the overall monitoring and high-risk periods, respectively. The wearable detected the initial CRS events at a median of 22 (-43 - 113.5) min earlier than SoC with Tf and a median of 184 (53 - 312) mins earlier than SoC with Ti method. In the no CRS subgroup, false CRS detection occurred in 1 pt with the Tf and 2 pts with the Ti method. Preliminary results suggest that time to CRS detection by the wearable device preceded SoC detection by a median of 103 minutes corroborated by both threshold methods. Temperature thresholds calibrated to the baseline temperature of individual patients facilitate earlier detection of CRS than fixed thresholds per clinical/ASTCT criteria. While the low false detection rate in is encouraging, these may also potentially be attributed to subclinical events. Both pts who had “false positive” triggers breached their individualized temperature thresholds via device readings while only recording low-grade temperatures that did not meet clinical CRS criteria per ASTCT, indicating possible capture of subclinical events. The study showcases the utility of continuous remote patient vital signs monitoring by wearable devices in efficiently capturing CRS, including subclinical events, earlier than SoC. Objective and reliable CRS monitoring may help safely transition workflows to outpatient CAR-T administration models. Analysis of trends in cytokine biomarkers for early CRS detection signal(s) is currently underway. Cytokine signals, alone and in combination with device data, are planned to be incorporated into machine learning models to build a CRS prediction index in future analyses.

Here, for the first time, we present an image-based deep learning method for the prediction of ORP productivity. Our method is based on parameter profile plot images of sensor parameters, including pH, dissolved oxygen, temperature, photosynthetically active radiation, and total dissolved solids.

We also performed Spearman's correlations to evaluate associations between speech measures and clinical scores (e.g., PSP rating scales and MoCA). In addition, the model's performance in classifying PSP and PD was evaluated using Rainbow passage reading analysis. Results: During Rainbow passage reading, PSP participants had a significantly slower articulation rate (2.45(0.49) vs 3.60(0.47) words/minute), lower speech-to-pause ratio (2.33(1.08) vs 3.67(1.18)), intelligibility dynamic time warping (DTW, 0.26(0.19) vs 0.53(0.26)), and similarity DTW (0.43(0.27) vs 0.67(0.13)) compared to PD participants.

Electrocardiographic Artificial Intelligence (ECG-AI) models assessing cardiovascular disease risk have been developed but few exist for FCHD. ECG-AI based FCHD risk prediction tools, which are currently lacking, based on single lead ECG data from wearable devices would enable scalable screening and/or monitoring of younger populations. Objectives: To develop a single lead ECG-based deep learning model for FCHD risk prediction and assess prediction concordance between paired clinical and Apple Watch ECGs. Methods: A FCHD lead I ECG-based 1D convolutional neural network model was developed using 420,834 ECGs (68,094 patients), obtained from UTHSC, TN. The final model was tested on paired lead I clinical and Apple Watch ECGs collected at the same visit from 55 volunteers (unknown FCHD status). The concordance of FCHD risk between the two ECG modalities was assessed using paired correlation analysis. Results: The UTHSC lead I ECG-AI model was developed on 80% data (5-fold cross-validation) and resulted in AUC=0.74 on the 20% holdout data. When implemented on 55 paired ECGs, there was strong positive correlation (Fig. 1) between predictions obtained from the two ECG modalities (correlation coefficient=0.82, p<0.001). Conclusion: FCHD risk may be predicted from 1 lead ECGs using Apple Watches with moderate accuracy and be concordant with clinical ECGs. ECG-AI models implemented on Apple Watch ECGs can help screen large populations for FCHD with ease and at low cost. Adding clinical variables in deep survival models might improve accuracy (further work). Some limitations of this pilot work include: lead I ECG-AI FCHD model is preliminary and not optimized, and the resolution (signal depth) of Apple Watch ECGs needs to be adjusted to match clinical ECGs (A/D conversion), yet such documentation is lacking.

Objectives/Aims: Aim of this pilot study within the H2020 project ALAMEDA-Bridging the Early Diagnosis and Treatment Gaps of Brain Diseases was to develop an integrated platform collecting patient-centred data from wearables and mobile devices through digital patient-reported outcomes (ePRO) and to test the toolkit's feasibility and usability in people with MS (PwMS). Methods: Data collection has been defined according to MULTIACT shared decisions model involving all relevant stakeholders in the selection of outcomes. These included physical parameters continuously recorded by a smartwatch; ePRO on mobility, cognitive functions, emotional status, daily life and sleep quality periodically administered to users through a smartphone App. Pseudonymised data were stored on the cloud and made accessible to healthcare professionals and researchers using a dashboard. The percentage of completed over scheduled ePRO was calculated as a feasibility outcome. Usability of the toolkit was measured with the System Usability Scale (SUS). Results: 20 PwMS (14 females; age=37.8±6.0 years; all relapsingremitting MS; disease duration=9.1±6.8 years; EDSS=2.2±1.3) were included and asked to use the ALAMEDA toolkit for one year. Half of them reached the 6-month milestone. Users correctly completed 53% of the scheduled ePRO and regularly wore the smartwatch without discomfort. Values of generated data are in line with those reported by the literature (Daily steps=8415±3028; daily minutes of vigorous / moderate / light activity=9.8±9.4 / 14.5±11.7 / 268.7±68.9; daily sedentary minutes=705.1±117.6; Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale-12=37.2±15.7; Arm function in Multiple Sclerosis Questionnaire=47.4±20.4; Perceived Deficit Questionnaire= 25.2±16.4; Beck Anxiety Inventory=17.3±16.0; Modified Fatigue Impact Scale=18.5±14.5; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index=25.2±16.4). SUS revealed high levels of confidence using the system and very high intention to use it in the future. Conclusion: The ALAMEDA toolkit seems feasible and usable to remotely monitor multiple domains of health status in PwMS. Further analysis on the dataset, including Artificial Intelligence and machine learning algorithms, may allow predicting relevant changes throughout the course of MS and anticipating the therapeutic intervention."

Various stakeholders worldwide use ICTs, including individuals, non-profit organizations, health practitioners, and governments. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, ICT has improved the quality of healthcare, the exchange of information, training of healthcare professionals and patients, and facilitated the relationship between patients and healthcare providers. This study systematically reviews the literature on ICT-based automatic and remote monitoring methods, as well as different ICT techniques used in the care of COVID-19-infected patients. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this systematic literature review is to identify the e-Health methods, associated ICTs, method implementation strategies, information collection techniques, advantages, and disadvantages of remote and automatic patient monitoring and care in COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The search included primary studies that were published between January 2020 and June 2022 in scientific and electronic databases, such as EBSCOhost, Scopus, ACM, Nature, SpringerLink, IEEE Xplore, MEDLINE, Google Scholar, JMIR, Web of Science, Science Direct, and PubMed. In this review, the findings from the included publications are presented and elaborated according to the identified research questions. Evidence-based systematic reviews and meta-analyses were conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework. Additionally, we improved the review process using the Rayyan tool and the Scale for the Assessment of Narrative Review Articles (SANRA). Among the eligibility criteria were methodological rigor, conceptual clarity, and useful implementation of ICTs in e-Health for remote and automatic monitoring of COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Our initial search identified 664 potential studies; 102 were assessed for eligibility in the pre-final stage and 65 articles were used in the final review with the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The review identified the following eHealth methods-Telemedicine, Mobile Health (mHealth), and Telehealth. The associated ICTs are Wearable Body Sensors, Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms, Internet-of-Things, or Internet-of-Medical-Things (IoT or IoMT), Biometric Monitoring Technologies (BioMeTs), and Bluetooth-enabled (BLE) home health monitoring devices. Spatial or positional data, personal and individual health, and wellness data, including vital signs, symptoms, biomedical images and signals, and lifestyle data are examples of information that is managed by ICTs. Different AI and IoT methods have opened new possibilities for automatic and remote patient monitoring with associated advantages and weaknesses. Our findings were represented in a structured manner using a semantic knowledge graph (e.g., ontology model). CONCLUSIONS: Various e-Health methods, related remote monitoring technologies, different approaches, information categories, the adoption of ICT tools for an automatic remote patient monitoring (RPM), advantages and limitations of RMTs in the COVID-19 case are discussed in this review. The use of e-Health during the COVID-19 pandemic illustrates the constraints and possibilities of using ICTs. ICTs are not merely an external tool to achieve definite remote and automatic health monitoring goals; instead, they are embedded in contexts. Therefore, the importance of the mutual design process between ICT and society during the global health crisis has been observed from a social informatics perspective. A global health crisis can be observed as an information crisis (e.g., insufficient information, unreliable information, and inaccessible information); however, this review shows the influence of ICTs on COVID-19 patients' health monitoring and related information collection techniques."

They provide the flexibility of monitoring elders remotely for their families and caregivers. Activities of daily living are an efficient way to effectively monitor elderly people at home and patients at caregiving facilities. The monitoring of such actions depends largely on IoT-based devices, either wireless or installed at different places. This paper proposes an effective and robust layered architecture using multisensory devices to recognize the activities of daily living from anywhere. Multimodality refers to the sensory devices of multiple types working together to achieve the objective of remote monitoring. Therefore, the proposed multimodal-based approach includes IoT devices, such as wearable inertial sensors and videos recorded during daily routines, fused together. The data from these multi-sensors have to be processed through a pre-processing layer through different stages, such as data filtration, segmentation, landmark detection, and 2D stick model. In next layer called the features processing, we have extracted, fused, and optimized different features from multimodal sensors. The final layer, called classification, has been utilized to recognize the activities of daily living via a deep learning technique known as convolutional neural network. It is observed from the proposed IoT-based multimodal layered system's results that an acceptable mean accuracy rate of 84.14% has been achieved."

To address these challenges, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models have been implicated in the diagnosis, prediction, and treatment of PD. Recent times have also demonstrated the implication of AI and ML models in the classification of PD based on neuroimaging methods, speech recording, gait abnormalities, and others.

Models include technology such as machine learning and smart wearables, that can be used to integrate patient data and improve continuity of care. This model may have benefits in situations where patient deterioration must be detected quickly so that a rapid response can occur such as cardiopulmonary settings. Aim: The purpose of this scoping review was to examine the evidence for a digital hospital model of care, in the context of cardiac and pulmonary settings. Design: Scoping review. Data sources: Databases searched were using PsycInfo, Ovid MEDLINE, and CINAHL. Studies written in English and containing key terms related to digital hospital and cardiopulmonary care were included. The Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for systematic reviews was used to assess the risk of bias. Results: Thirteen (13) studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. For cardiac conditions, a deep-learning-based rapid response system warning system for predicting patient deterioration leading to cardiac arrest had up to 257% higher sensitivity than conventional methods. There was also a reduction in the number of patients who needed to be examined by a physician. Using continuous telemonitoring with a wireless real-time electrocardiogram compared with non-monitoring, there was improved initial resuscitation and 24-hour post-event survival for high-risk patients. However, there were no benefits for survival to discharge. For pulmonary conditions, a natural language processing algorithm reduced the time to asthma diagnosis, demonstrating high predictive values. Virtual inhaler education was found to be as effective as in-person education, and prescription error was reduced following the implementation of computer-based physician order entry electronic medical records and a clinical decision support tool. Conclusions: While we currently have only a brief glimpse at the impact of technology care delivery for cardiac and respiratory conditions, technology presents an opportunity to improve quality and safety in care, but only with the support of adequate infrastructure and processes.

Unlike traditional in-person evaluation or ecological momentary assessment (EMA) questionnaire-based approaches, these data sources open many possibilities in remote patient monitoring.

This work proposes an attention-based Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network-based pipeline for predicting mobility impairment based on WHODAS 2.0 evaluation from such digital biomarkers. Furthermore, we addressed the missing observation problem by utilising hidden Markov models and the possibility of including information from unlabelled samples via transfer learning. We validated our approach using two wearable/mobile sensor data sets collected in the wild and socio-demographic information about the patients. Our results showed that in the WHODAS 2.0 mobility impairment prediction task, the proposed pipeline outperformed a prior baseline while additionally providing interpretability with attention heatmaps. Moreover, using a much smaller cohort via task transfer learning, the same model could learn to predict generalised anxiety severity accurately based on GAD-7 scores."

Decentralized trials and digital health solutions have been suggested as potential solutions and have certainly risen to the challenge during the pandemic. Clinical trial designs are now increasingly data driven. The use of distributed clinical data networks and digitization has helped to fundamentally upgrade existing research systems. A trial design may vary anywhere from fully decentralized to hybrid to traditional on-site. Various decentralization components are available for stakeholders to increase the reach and pace of their trials, such as electronic informed consent, remote interviews, administration, outcome assessment, monitoring, and laboratory and imaging modalities. Furthermore, digital health technologies can be included to enrich study conduct. However, careful consideration is warranted, including assessing verification and validity through usability studies and having various contingencies in place through dedicated risk assessment. Selecting the right combination depends not just on the ability to handle patient care and the medical know-how but also on the availability of appropriate technologic infrastructure, skills, and human resources. Throughout this process, quality of evidence generation and physician-patient relation must not be undermined.

To address this issue, we aimed to develop a predictive model to identify individuals at risk of nocturnal hypoglycaemia before going to bed at night. Materials and methods: The development of the prediction model was considered a classification problem and followed FDA's Good Machine Learning Practice for Medical Device Development. We collected continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data from 60 individuals with type 2 diabetes from the intervention arm in the ongoing telemonitoring trial DiaMonT. Data were segmented into 24-hour periods separated at midnight and labelled as nocturnal hypoglycaemia when at least fifteen consecutive minutes were spent below 3.9 mmol/L during the following night (00:01-05:59). The periods were further divided into four intervals for feature selection: last night (00:01-05:59), morning (06:00-09:00), day (06:00-00:00), and evening (21:00-00:00). Potential CGM-based features included the minimum and maximum values, range, slope, glycemic variability, standard deviation, variance, and mean from each time interval as well as the last value for the period. Additionally, a relative variant of each feature was calculated by subtracting the mean of the feature from previous periods within the same individual. The data were partitioned into 67% for training a model based on logistic regression while the remaining 33% were reserved for testing the model. During training, the data were balanced using synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) and features were included in the model by forward selection in a five-fold cross-validation. The model was then tested on the remaining 33% for the ability to predict 24-hour periods resulting in nocturnal hypoglycaemia. Results: From the CGM data, 5100 periods were extracted out of which 92 periods resulted in nocturnal hypoglycaemia. The final model was based on the minimum value during the day, the minimum value during last night, the last value (relative), and the variance during evening (relative). The model obtained an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.85 on the independent test data (Figure 1) (p < 0.001). The model had a sensitivity of 0.75 at a specificity of 0.80. Conclusion: A prediction model based on CGM data can potentially be a valuable addition to telemonitoring to prevent nocturnal hypoglycaemia for insulin-treated individuals with type 2 diabetes.

The commercial availability of low-cost commercial NFC integrated circuits (ICs) and their massive integration in smartphones, used as readers and cloud interfaces, have aroused great interest in new batteryless NFC sensors. The fact that coil antennas are not importantly affected by the body compared with other wireless sensors based on far-field communications makes this technology suitable for future wearable point-of-care testing (PoCT) devices. This review first compares energy harvesting based on NFC to other energy-harvesting technologies. Next, some practical recommendations for designing and tuning NFC-based tags are described. Power transfer is key because in most cases, the energy harvested has to be stable for several seconds and not contaminated by undesired signals. For this reason, the effect of the dimensions of the coils and the conductivity on the wireless power transfer is thoroughly discussed. In the last part of the review, the state of the art in NFC-based chemical and biosensors is presented. NFC-based tags (or sensor tags) are mainly based on commercial or custom NFC ICs, which are used to harvest the energy from the RF field generated by the smartphone to power the electronics. Low-consumption colorimeters and potentiostats can be integrated into these NFC tags, opening the door to the integration of chemical sensors and biosensors, which can be harvested and read from a smartphone. The smartphone is also used to upload the acquired information to the cloud to facilitate the internet of medical things (IoMT) paradigm. Finally, several chipless sensors recently proposed in the literature as a low-cost alternative for chemical applications are discussed."

EEG-based stress monitoring is quite popular in this context, but impractical to use for continuous remote monitoring.Continuous remote monitoring of stress using signals acquired from everyday wearables like smart watches is the best alternative here. Non-EEG data such as heart rate and ectodermal activity can also act as indicators of physiological stress. In this work, we have explored the possibility of using nonlinear features from non-EEG data such as (a) heart rate, (b) ectodermal activity, (c) body temperature (d) SpO2 and (e) acceleration in detecting four different types of neurological states; namely (1) Relaxed state, (2) State of Physical stress, (3) State of Cognitive stress and (4) State of Emotional stress.

We trained the models using linear and nonlinear features separately. For the 2-class and 4-class problems, using nonlinear features increased the accuracy of the models. Moreover, it is also proved in this study that by using nonlinear features, we can avoid the use of complex machine learning models."

Electrocardiogram (ECG) characteristics are observed to be altered due to CAD and can be studied to develop a screening tool for its detection. The subject's clinical information can help broadly identify the high-cardiac-risk population and serve as a primary step in diagnosing CAD. This paper presents an approach to automatically detect CAD based on clinical data, morphological ECG features, and heart rate variability (HRV) features extracted from short-duration Lead-II ECG recordings. A few popular machine-learning classifiers, including support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), K-nearest neighbours (KNN), Gaussian Naïve Bayes (GNB), and multi-layer perceptron (MLP), are trained on the extracted feature space, and their performance is evaluated.

An RF classifier built using features extracted from all limb leads has outperformed classifiers built on combinations of them with five-fold cross-validation training accuracy of 97.9 (±0.008) % and testing accuracy of 98 %.Clinical relevance- As high sensitivity is reported in identifying recent MI and past MI classes, the proposed approach is suitable for preventative healthcare applications since it is less likely that subjects with recent or past MI will be misclassified. Due to its low computational complexity, better interpretability, and comparable performance to the state-of-the-art results, the proposed approach can be employed in clinical and cardiac health screening applications. It also has the potential to be employed in remote monitoring with mobile and wearable devices because it is built on features extracted from only lead I and II ECG recordings."

In parallel, ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) were collected each minute from the study participants. A 2-minute moving window, with one minute shift, was applied to each 16-minute exercise session to divide it into a total of fifteen 2-minute windows. Based on the self-reported RPE, each exercise window was labeled as ""high exertion"" or ""low exertion"" classes. The heart rate variability (HRV) characteristics in time and frequency domains were extracted from the collected ECG signals for each window. In addition, collected oxygen saturation levels, pulse rate, and RPMs were averaged for each window. The best predictive features were then selected using the minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) algorithm. Top selected features were then used to assess the accuracy of five ML classifiers to predict the level of exertion. The Naïve Bayes model demonstrated the best performance with an accuracy of 80% and an F1 score of 79%."

However, some chronic pain patients are inconsistent with their patterns of wearable device use, charging, and responding to digital surveys. This clinical study examines whether patients will engage more regularly with these digital tools when provided with personalized feedback and targeted messaging regarding pain and common comorbidities via an entertaining user experience. Methods: This is a prospective, longitudinal, dual-arm clinical trial designed to enroll 28 patients into two study arms (14 patients per arm). In the traditional study arm, patients are provided with a remote monitoring smartphone application and wearable physiologic sensors. In the personalized experience study arm, patients are provided with these same tools, but are given a version of the remote monitoring app that provides a simple personalized user experience including engaging dialog, stories, targeted education related to chronic pain, and feedback on their health and holistic well-being. Patient engagement is measured by the consistency with which patients engage with the application, respond to therapy-related surveys, and use their wearable device properly. The interim analysis included in this report consists of the available survey data from five initial subjects in the traditional study arm before and during the SCS trial period. Enrollment of the first patient in the personalized experience arm occurred in July 2022 and follow-up and analysis are ongoing. Results: Three of five interviewed subjects wanted to be able to view their wearable data daily, while the other two subjects preferred to view them weekly. Subjects preferred using the Oura™ Ring and Apple Watch® due to their comfort and ease of use. Subjects also preferred the weekly recharging of the Oura ring (vs. daily watch charging). Conclusions: This research seeks to demonstrate feasibility for using patient-centric app design and artificial intelligence to improve user engagement with digital therapies in the field of chronic pain. We hypothesize that patients will be more engaged with use of digital tools if they are provided with an engaging and simple user experience that interests them and educates them regarding their chronic pain and related well-being topics. Chronic pain is a multi-dimensional disorder that can impact patient physical, social, and mental well-being [1]. Ongoing research should investigate whether digital education can also be used concurrently with neuromodulation to motivate patients to make positive lifestyle changes that are synergistic with their SCS therapy.

Several applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) to trial design and conduct have the potential to increase trial efficiency, and the use of real world data (RWD) is often critical to the development of these novel applications. Objectives: The objective of this study was to comprehensively review applications of AI/ML that used RWD to improve clinical trial design and conduct. Methods: We conducted a review of published work on AI/ML-based technologies for clinical trials, focusing on AI/ML applications trained using RWD. The review provides a survey of the field, with concrete examples of applications and explanations of the machine learning task. Additionally, we describe open challenges and opportunities for the use of AI/ML based on real world data to improve clinical trials. Results: RWD is essential to training AI/ML algorithms used for clinical trial optimization; over 50 published examples were found by the review. We identified four overarching categories of applications: (1) improved participant recruitment; (2) enhanced trial management; (3) enabled remote patient monitoring (e.g., signal processing from wearables); and (4) in silico trials. Lack of freely available RWD, limited model generalizability, privacy considerations, potential fairness issues, lack of familiarity with AI/ML methods, and limited prospective evaluations of novel approaches pose challenges for the expanded use of AI/ML in clinical trial optimization. Opportunities for advancing applications include transfer learning to accommodate limited domain-specific data, increased use of multi-modal data to train models, and applications of federated learning to develop AI/ML models when data is distributed. Conclusions: AI/ML technologies based on RWE have the potential to reduce costs and optimize clinical trials, and hold promise to continue to improve study efficiency in a way that directly impacts the patient experience."

Digital health interventions have various benefit on clinical efficacy, quality of care and reducing healthcare costs. The objective of the study is to identify new reimbursement policy trend of digital health medical devices in South Korea. Methods: Official announcements published in national bodies and supplementary secondary research were used to capture policies, frameworks and currently approved products since 2019. Results: With policy development, several digital health devices and AI software have been introduced as non-reimbursement by utilizing new Health Technology Assessment (nHTA) pathway including grace period of nHTA and innovative medical devices integrated assessment pathway. AI based cardiac arrest risk management software (DeepCARS®) and electroceutical device for major depressive disorders (MINDD STIM®) have been approved as non-reimbursement use for about 3 years. Two digital therapeutics for insomnia and AI software for diagnosis of cerebral infarction were approved as the first innovative medical devices under new integrated assessment system, and they could be treated in the market. In addition, there is remote patient monitoring (RPM) reimbursement service fee. Continuous glucose monitoring devices have been reimbursed for type 1 diabetes patients by the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) since January 2019. Homecare RPM service for peritoneal dialysis patients with cloud platform (Sharesource®) has been reimbursed since December 2019, and long-term continuous ECG monitoring service fee for wearable ECG monitoring devices (ATpatch®, MEMO®) became reimbursement since January 2022. Conclusions: Although Korean government has been developed guidelines for digital health actively, only few products had been reimbursed. To introduce new technologies for improved patient centric treatment, novel value-based assessment and new pricing guideline of digital health medical devices are quite required."

In this clinical trial, we randomly assigned 500 patients discharged from hospital to home to use either a smartphone or wearable device to collect and transmit remote patient monitoring (RPM) data on activity patterns after hospital discharge. Analyses were conducted at the patient-day level using discrete-time survival analysis. Each arm was split into training and testing folds. The training set used fivefold cross-validation and then final model results are from predictions on the test set. A standard model comprised data collected up to the time of discharge including demographics, comorbidities, hospital length of stay, and vitals prior to discharge. An enhanced model consisted of the standard model plus RPM data. Traditional parametric regression models (logit and lasso) were compared to nonparametric machine learning approaches (random forest, gradient boosting, and ensemble). The main outcome was hospital readmission or death within 30 days of discharge. Prediction of 30-day hospital readmission significantly improved when including remotely-monitored patient data on activity patterns after hospital discharge and using nonparametric machine learning approaches. Wearables slightly outperformed smartphones but both had good prediction of 30-day hospital-readmission."

This study aims to investigate the use of wearable-sensor-derived physical activity data and machine learning to objectively identify physical-aggressive incidents in children. Participants (n = 39) aged 7 to 16 years, with and without ADHD, wore a waist-worn activity monitor (ActiGraph, GT3X+) for up to one week, three times over 12 months, while demographic, anthropometric, and clinical data were collected. Machine learning techniques, specifically random forest, were used to analyze patterns that identify physical-aggressive incident with 1-min time resolution. A total of 119 aggression episodes, lasting 7.3 ± 13.1 min for a total of 872 1-min epochs including 132 physical aggression epochs, were collected. The model achieved high precision (80.2%), accuracy (82.0%), recall (85.0%), F1 score (82.4%), and area under the curve (89.3%) to distinguish physical aggression epochs. The sensor-derived feature of vector magnitude (faster triaxial acceleration) was the second contributing feature in the model, and significantly distinguished aggression and non-aggression epochs. If validated in larger samples, this model could provide a practical and efficient solution for remotely detecting and managing aggressive incidents in children."

Millions of people are potentially eligible to receive and benefit from this mode of therapy. Monitoring of medical therapy is essential to guide patients and ensure adherence and optimal results. The high prevalence of obesity combined with limited numbers of physicians adequately trained in its management poses a challenge to provision of care at scale. An online platform with an AI-powered clinical dashboard allows for granular, temporal patient reporting on outcomes and side effects. Method: The “clinics” application by StuffThatWorks is a unique tool that allows chronological flow and automated data processing for remote patient monitoring. Patients accept a digital invitation and complete online surveys about medical history, eating and lifestyle habits. The system integrates objective data from digital scales, wearables, and EMR, as well as subjective data, with patients tracking their overall well-being, symptoms, and side effects. These data are transformed into a concise graphical format expediting clinical assessment and facilitating timely messaging, including encouragement and responses to any form of decline. Artificial intelligence provides automated clinical insights to providers to guide decision support and deliver patient feedback. Lastly, the system facilitates contextual education, with automated delivery of educational patient materials correlating to treatment stage Results: The “clinics” application to support pharmacotherapy for weight loss has been adopted by large weight management clinics in Israel. Patients self-weigh at least once weekly using a Bluetooth connected scale and are prompted to report on their general wellbeing and gastrointestinal side effects. Other pertinent symptoms, target behaviors, life events and data from wearables are also tracked. Data are processed and presented online in summary format on the dashboard with clinical alerts, and in full on individual patient pages. The application allows rapid, effective evaluation of health status and remote personalized management. Clinics choose different methods to utilize the platform according to their resources. Case managers may review the entire dashboard daily and triage care accordingly, or rely on preset thresholds for clinical alerts and approval of dose escalation schedules. The platform has been adopted by both patients and caregivers alike with enthusiasm, and satisfaction levels are being actively assessed. Patient reported information is analyzed to build personalized trajectories and allow further individualized decision support. Conclusion: The StuffThatWorks “clinics” application, when adapted to drug therapy for obesity, functions as a granular, sequential reporting platform that creates a basis for remote management. The system generates value by saving physician time, improving patient-caregiver interactions, and building a database that allows for effective long-term management at the large scale necessary to tackle the epidemic proportions of obesity worldwide."

The COVID pandemic has highlighted the potential safety benefits of post-discharge RPM in the ED, especially in remote/rural settings. This study aimed to determine the feasibility characteristics of smartwatches in health status tracking for post-COVID patients. Measures and Design: This prospective feasibility trial enrolled patients rehabilitating at home from acute COVID in remote/rural Alberta. Patients were asked to wear a Fitbit Charge 2 device continuously and device metrics were extracted for analysis (e.g. heart rate, sleep, and activity). Electronic patient reported outcome measures (e-PROMS) for mental (bi-weekly) and physical (daily) health were collected via SMS text and email. Exit surveys and semistructured interviews evaluated the patient experience. The primary outcome was proportion of time (study-hours) with usable heart rate data. Secondary measures included completion rate for e-PROMs, patient satisfaction, patient-perceived clinical utility and mental health impacts. Evaluation/results: Of 17 eligible patients, 11 agreed to participate. The mean age was 52 yrs and 73% were female. Five patients (45%) were hospitalized (avg. stay 41 days) and 4 required mechanical ventilation; 6 already owned a smartwatch. The most prominent physical symptoms were fatigue, muscle weakness, headache, and dyspnea. On average, patients had moderate to severe anxiety (GAD 7 = 15.8), depression (PHQ-9 = 19.9), and stress (PSS = 26.6). A total of 21,040 patient-hours were monitored, averaging 1913 hrs per patient (SD = 1396). Heart rate data was usable for 83% of studyhours. Surveys were completed 83% and 72% of the time for mental and physical health, respectively. Survey scores were favorable for usability/acceptability (3.9/7), perceived clinical utility (3.5/7) and mental health impacts (3.8/7). Interviews revealed overall positive patient experience with varying concerns about data privacy/security. Discussion/impact: Smartwatches are feasible tools for RPM, especially given their usability, affordability, and patient acceptance. We will present preliminary estimates for longitudinal associations between smartwatch parameters and e-PROMS.

PPG is normally recorded by wearable devices that are prone to artifacts. This results in signal corruption that decreases measurement accuracy. Thus, a signal quality assessment (SQA) system is essential in obtaining reliable measurements. Conventionally, SQA is mainly driven by human-knowledge and supervised through experts' annotations. However, they are not tailored for the particularities of the domain applications. Hence, we propose a machine-aided SQA framework that generates respective quality criteria for applications. By using the proposed approach, quality criteria can be easily trained for different applications. Then, quality assessment can be applied to several PPG-based physiological signals telemonitoring. Compared with conventional approaches, the proposed system has a higher rejection rate for high-error signals and a lower mean absolute error is achieved when estimating heart rate (-3.06 BPM), determining respiration rate (-1.36 BPM), and predicting hypertension (+24%).

However, no existing intelligent protection system covers all these essential aspects. Herein, we developed an intelligent wearable filtration system (IWFS) via advanced nanotechnology and machine learning. Based on the triboelectric mechanism, the fabricated IWFS exhibits a long-lasting high particle filtration efficiency and bacteria protection efficiency of 99% and 100%, respectively, with a low-pressure drop of 5.8 mmH2O. Correspondingly, the charge accumulation of the optimized IWFS (87 nC) increased to 3.5 times that of the pristine nanomesh, providing a significant enhancement of the particle filtration efficiency. Theoretical principles, including the enhancement of the β-phase and the lower surface potential of the modified nanomesh, were quantitatively investigated by molecular dynamics simulation, band theory, and Kelvin probe force microscopy. Furthermore, we endowed the IWFS with a healthcare monitoring function and man-machine interactive capability through machine learning and wireless transmission technology. Crucial physiological signals of people, including breath, cough, and speaking signals, were detected and classified, with a high recognition rate of 92%; the fabricated IWFS can collect healthcare data and transmit voice commands in real time without hindrance by portable electronic devices.

Non-invasive and contactless monitoring has emerged as an optimal solution for this problem, with telemedicine, self-monitoring, and well- being tools being the next generation of technology in the biomedical field. However, there is worldwide concern about the general purpose and bias towards a certain demographic group of these techniques. In particular, skin tone and the accuracy of monitoring dark skin tone groups have been key questions among researchers, with the lack of results and studies contributing to this uncertainty. Methods: This paper proposes a benchmark for remote monitoring solution against a medical device across different skin tone people. Around 330 videos from 90 different patients were analyzed, and Heart Rate and Heart Rate Variability were compared across different subgroups. The Fitzpatrick scale (1-6) was used to classify participants into three skin tone groups: 1 and 2; 3 and 4; 5 and 6. Results: The results showed that our proposed methodology was able to estimate heart rate with a mean absolute error of 3 bpm across all samples and subgroups. Moreover, for Heart Rate Variability (HRV) metrics, we achieved the following results, in terms of Mobility Assistive Equipment (MAE): HRV-IBI (Inter-Beat-Interval) of 10 ms; HRV-SDNN (Standard Deviation of Normal to Normal heartbeats) of 14 ms and HRV-RMSSD (Root Mean Square of Successive Differences between normal heartbeats) of 22 ms. No significant performance decrease was found for any skin tone group, and there was no error trend towards a certain group. Conclusions: The study showed that our methodology meets acceptable agreement levels for the proposed metrics and is well-suited for users who want to understand their general health and wellness. Furthermore, the experiments showed that skin tone had no impact on the results, which remained within the same range across all groups."

Methods: The LINK-HF2 study consists of two phases. The completed, non-randomized vanguard phase enrolled 27 patients with HF at 2 VA sites, and the ongoing main randomized phase will enroll 240 patients at 5 VA sites. The predictive AI system used in this study is a cloud-based analytic platform that generates a multivariate change index (MCI) to identify changes in observed physiological patterns that deviate from the expected normal behavior. Results: In the vanguard phase, comprehensive implementation program was developed and examined integration of non-invasive remote monitoring and subsequent algorithmic response to the clinical workflow. Clinicians responded to notifications within 24 hours in 95% of instances and clinical action was taken in 25% of instances. Challenges included over-alerting, time needed for data review, staffing, and deference to other providers. The results of the vanguard phase were used to make the following protocol adjustments: 1.

However, there still remains a critical challenge in developing a multifunctional sensing system for complex signal detection and analysis in practical applications. Here, we develop a machine learning-combined flexible sensor for real-time tactile sensing and voice recognition through laser-induced graphitization. The intelligent sensor with a triboelectric layer can convert local pressure to an electrical signal through a contact electrification effect without external bias, which has a characteristic response behavior when exposed to various mechanical stimuli. With the special patterning design, a smart human-machine interaction controlling system composed of a digital arrayed touch panel is constructed to control electronic devices. Based on machine learning, the real-time monitoring and recognition of the changes of voice are achieved with high accuracy.

Sweat, one of the most suitable biological fluids for non-invasive monitoring, contains various chemical elements relating abundant information about human health conditions. In this work, a new type of non-invasive and highly stretchable potentiometric sweat sensor was developed based on all-solid-state ion-selective electrode (ISE) coupled with poly(dimethylsiloxane; PDMS) and polyurethane (PU). This highly stretchable composite of PDMS-PU allows the sensor to be robust, with the PDMS providing a flexible backbone and the PU enhancing the adhesion between the electrodes and the substrate. In addition, graphene–carbon nanotube (CNT) network 3D nanomaterials were introduced to modify the ion selective membrane (ISM) in order to increase the charge transfer activity of the ISEs, which also could minimize the formation of water layers on the electrode surface, as such nanomaterials are highly hydrophobic. As a result, the sensor demonstrated a wide detection range of NH4+ from 10−6 M to 10−1 M with high stability and sensitivity—showing a high sensitivity of 59.6 ± 1.5 mV/log [NH4+] and an LOD lower than 10−6 M. Under a strain of 40%, the sensor still showed a sensitivity of 42.7 ± 3.1 mV/log [NH4+]. The proposed highly stretchable and robust electrochemical sweat sensor provides a new choice for wearable-device-based personal daily healthcare management beyond hospital-centric healthcare monitoring."

In this research, we present a machine learning (ML)-based remote monitoring method to estimate patient recovery from COVID-19 symptoms using automatically collected wearable device data, instead of relying on manually collected symptom data. We deploy our remote monitoring system, namely eCOVID, in two COVID-19 telemedicine clinics. Our system utilizes a Garmin wearable and symptom tracker mobile app for data collection. The data consists of vitals, lifestyle, and symptom information which is fused into an online report for clinicians to review. Symptom data collected via our mobile app is used to label the recovery status of each patient daily. We propose a ML-based binary patient recovery classifier which uses wearable data to estimate whether a patient has recovered from COVID-19 symptoms. We evaluate our method using leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation, and find that Random Forest (RF) is the top performing model. Our method achieves an F1-score of 0.88 when applying our RF-based model personalization technique using weighted bootstrap aggregation.

Technological advancements, such as the use of artificial intelligence or virtual visit appointments, is emerging as a new form of healthcare provided. While these technologies have existed far before the COVID-19 pandemic, it has expedited the mass population's acclimation to digital therapeutics within healthcare. One such technology is remote patient monitoring (RPM) which allow healthcare providers to track and follow a patient's health status without their physical presence in a healthcare setting. RPM can be achieved through different mediums such as wearable devices, sensors, and mobile applications. RPM appears to “keep up with the times” as it allows patients to be in the comfort of their own home, provides real time feedback to providers, and improves patient health. Purpose: Previous studies of RPM programs explore their efficacy. Studies show that RPM programs can potentially have large benefits within the healthcare ecosystem as they can lead to lower number of hospitalizations, decrease risk for readmissions, and reduce costs. However, limited research delves into the factors that affect patients' engagement with an RPM program. Therefore, the purpose of this investigation is to assess factors that affect user engagement with the implementation of an innovative RPM program. Description: GetWell Loop (GWL) is a mobile health application serving as an RPM program within the Froedtert Health system where post-discharge hospitalized patients had the option of being enrolled in the GWL service. Through this mobile app, patients were able to update their providers regarding their day-to-day health status through virtual questionnaires, submit questions, and receive feedback in real time. All inpatient hospital discharges within the Froedtert Health system between March 2020 - November 2020 were stratified on readmission risk (low, medium, high). Low-risk patients were offered access to GWL, while moderate-risk and highrisk patients were offered access to GWL and the conventional care coordination. Demographic data was obtained from EPIC, while GWL specific usage was obtained from the GWL application. Various demographic variables were being analyzed such as patient age, patient sex, marital status, and risk level for hospital readmission. Engagement was defined as an engagement score of greater than 50%. This number is a calculation of the number of touchpoints the user engaged with the application compared to the total number of touchpoints offered by the GWL application. Univariate and chisquared analysis was used to examine demographic and user differences between users who engaged in the application and those who did not. Multivariate analysis was then run to control for all factors to determine true significance. Conclusions: Preliminary data suggests that patients with a low risk level for readmission are approximately two times more likely to be engaged with GWL than high risk level patients. There were no significant differences in engagement between age, sex, race, language, insurance provider type, or area of deprivation index Information from this study can help inform health systems on how to better implement such technologies more appropriately and efficiently. Maximizing the understanding of when and where RPM programs are the most useful can help towards achieving better patient care, higher patient satisfaction, and improved outcomes.

Analysis of changes in these parameters during the course of diuresis aimed to recognize subgroups with different response patterns. Parameters did not change significantly, however, subgroup analysis of the last quartile of treatment showed significant differences in cardiac output, cardiac index, stroke volume, pulse rate, and systemic vascular resistance according to gender, and in systolic blood pressure according to habitus. Changes in the last quartile could be differentiated using k-means, a technique of unsupervised machine learning. Moreover, patients’ responses could be best clustered into four groups. Analysis of baseline parameters showed that two of the clusters differed by baseline parameters, body mass index, and diabetes status. To conclude, we show that physiological changes during diuresis in HF patients can be categorized into subgroups sharing similar response trends, making noninvasive monitoring a potential key to personalized treatment in HF."

However, no review has explored the landscape of smart home technologies that aim to promote physical activity and independent living among a wide range of age groups. Objective: This review aims to map published studies on smart home technologies aimed at promoting physical activity among the general and aging populations to unveil the state of the art, its potential, and the research gaps and opportunities. Methods: Articles were retrieved from 6 databases (PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, ACM Library, and Web of Science). The criteria for inclusion were that the articles must be user studies that dealt with smart home or Active Assisted Living technologies and physical activity, were written in English, and were published in peer-reviewed journals. In total, 3 researchers independently and collaboratively assessed the eligibility of the retrieved articles and elicited the relevant data and findings using tables and charts. Results: This review synthesized 20 articles that met the inclusion criteria, 70% (14/20) of which were conducted between 2018 and 2020. Three-quarters of the studies (15/20, 75%) were conducted in Western countries, with the United States accounting for 25% (5/20). Activities of daily living were the most studied (9/20, 45%), followed by physical activity (6/20, 30%), therapeutic exercise (4/20, 20%), and bodyweight exercise (1/20, 5%). K-nearest neighbor and naïve Bayes classifier were the most used machine learning algorithms for activity recognition, with at least 10% (2/20) of the studies using either algorithm. Ambient and wearable technologies were equally studied (8/20, 40% each), followed by robots (3/20, 15%). Activity recognition was the most common goal of the evaluated smart home technologies, with 55% (11/20) of the studies reporting it, followed by activity monitoring (7/20, 35%). Most studies (8/20, 40%) were conducted in a laboratory setting. Moreover, 25% (5/20) and 10% (2/20) were conducted in a home and hospital setting, respectively.

Methods: We developed several relevant parameters, including 10M normalized reads, double-discard reads, Genus Rank Ratio, King Genus Rank Ratio, Genus Rank Ratio*Genus Rank, and King Genus Rank Ratio*Genus Rank. These parameters, together with frequently used read indicators including raw reads, reads per million mapped reads (RPM), transcript per kilobase per million mapped reads (TPM), Genus Rank, and coverage were analyzed for their diagnostic efficiency in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), a common source for detecting eight bacterium pathogens: Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Hemophilus influenzae, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Aspergillus fumigatus. Results: The results demonstrated that these indicators exhibited good diagnostic efficacy for the eight pathogens. The AUC values of all indicators were almost greater than 0.9, and the corresponding sensitivity and specificity values were almost greater than 0.8, excepted coverage.

These parameters can serve as a reference for interpreting mNGS data of BALF. Moreover, precision filters integrating our novel parameters were built to detect the eight bacterium pathogens in BALF samples through machine learning. Summary: In this study, we developed a set of novel parameters for pathogen identification in clinical mNGS based on reads and ranking. These parameters were found to be more effective in diagnosing pathogens than traditional approaches. The findings provide valuable insights for improving the interpretation of mNGS reports in clinical settings, specifically in BALF analysis."

The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status is frequently used but is often a subjective assessment open to varied interpretations. This project implemented a telemedicine system to monitor alterations in vital signs, with the aim of evaluating whether such data could predict real-time ECOG performance status and 1-year survival using machine learning models. Methods: VitalPatch, a Class IIa medical device, was utilized as the monitoring system, continuously tracking seven key parameters (respiratory frequency, oxygen saturation, heart rate, temperature, single-lead ECG data, posture, step count, and fall detection) in oncological high-risk patients over seven days. Laboratory and clinical assessments were also incorporated for comprehensive patient evaluation. We first performed Mann- Whitney U test to identify differences in terms of vital signs between different groups of patients. Then, we trained different machine learning models-logistic regression, random forest classifier, and XGBoost- to predict ECOG PS, C-reactive protein level (CRP) and survival status. To this end ECOG PS was categorized as 'high' (2-3) or 'low' (0-1), C-reactive protein level (CRP) was categorized as 'high' (values >50 mg/L) or 'low' (0- 10 mg/L), and survival status was determined one year postmonitoring. Finally, performance of the models was assessed using the F1 weighted score metric and the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC AUC). Results: Analysis of data from 28 patients indicated significant differences in mean heart rates between high and low ECOG PS scores (p = 0.0094) and high and low CRP levels (p = 0.027). The Random Forest model yielded promising predictions for ECOG (F1 score = 0.9124, ROC AUC = 0.900) and 1-year survival (F1 score = 0.771, ROC AUC = 0.800). Conclusions: This preliminary analysis indicates substantial potential to develop AI algorithms that utilize vital signs to determine ECOG PS and predict 1-year survival status, with heart rate being notably indicative. These results signify progress in leveraging telemedicine and remote monitoring to enhance patient care, particularly in oncology. Expanded research with larger populations is essential to corroborate these promising findings."

While there is no cure, levodopa therapy has been shown to mitigate symptoms. A patient on levodopa experiences cycles in the severity of their symptoms, characterized by an ON state—when the drug is active—and an OFF state—when symptoms worsen as the drug wears off. The longitudinal progression of the disease is monitored using episodic assessments performed by trained physicians in the clinic, such as the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Lately, there has been an effort in the field to develop continuous, objective measures of motor symptoms based on wearable sensors and other remote monitoring devices. In this work, we present an effort towards such a solution that uses a single wearable inertial sensor to automatically assess the postural instability and gait disorder (PIGD) of a Parkinson’s disease patient. Sensor data was collected from two independent studies of subjects performing the UPDRS test and then used to train and validate a convolutional neural network model. Given the typical limited size of such studies we also employed the use of generative adversarial networks to improve the performance of deep-learning models that usually require larger amounts of data for training. We show that for a 2-min walk test, our method’s predicted PIGD scores can be used to identify a patient’s ON/OFF states better than a physician evaluated on the same criteria.

Although presenting higher prevalence rates than the general population, it is often not reported or remains unnoticed. Moreover, somatic symptoms of depression are common in the oncological context and should not be dismissed as a general symptom of cancer. It becomes even more challenging to track psychological distress in the period after the treatment, where connection with the healthcare system typically becomes sporadic. The main goal of the FAITH project is to remotely identify and predict depressive symptoms in cancer survivors, based on a federated machine learning (ML) approach, towards optimization of privacy. Methods: FAITH will remotely analyse depression markers, predicting their negative trends. These markers will be treated in distinct categories, namely nutrition, sleep, activity and voice, assessed in part through wearable technologies. The study will include 300 patients who have had a previous diagnosis of breast or lung cancer and will be recruited 1 to 5 years after the end of primary cancer. The study will be organized as a 12-month longitudinal prospective observational cohort study, with monthly assessments to evaluate depression symptoms and quality of life among cancer survivors. The primary endpoint is the severity of depressive symptoms as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (Ham-D) at months 3, 6, 9 and 12. Secondary outcomes include self-reported anxiety and depression symptoms (HADS scale), and perceived quality of life (EORTC questionnaires), at baseline and monthly. Based on the predictive models gathered during the study, FAITH will also aim at further developing a conceptual federated learning framework, enabling to build machine learning models for the prediction and monitoring of depression without direct access to user’s personal data. Discussion: Improvements in the objectivity of psychiatric assessment are necessary. Wearable technologies can provide potential indicators of depression and anxiety and be used for biofeedback. If the FAITH application is effective, it will provide healthcare systems with a novel and innovative method to screen depressive symptoms in oncological settings.

One of the major obstacles for early discharge after aHSCT is aside from frailty the high risk for infections and the need for monitoring of graft versus host disease. This requires frequent hospital visits which is in times of Covid19 often a challenge and patients express reluctancy due to the higher risk of disease transmission in congested outpatient clinics. Furthermore, structured data acquisition is missing, especially in the home care setting. Methods: We have developed a mobile phone application for aHSCT patients that allows for specific symptom reporting and, in combination with a wearable device for online monitoring of major vital signs in real time. The application captures currently more than 50 data points relevant for aHSCT and infectious disease monitoring. It is based on REACT/NATIVE and JSON coding and enables specific designs based on requirements. Data captured by the wearable devices and manual symptom reporting are displayed in a close to real time fashion on a browser-based dashboard to the physician in a comprehensive fashion to allow for trend assessment of all transplant relevant information.

For the analysis of medical scans, various studies integrate sophisticated deep learning strategies. A smart monitoring system is needed as a proactive diagnostic solution that may be employed in an epidemiological scenario such as COVID-19. Consequently, this work offers an intelligent medicare system that is an IoT-empowered, deep learning-based decision support system (DSS) for the automated detection and categorization of infectious diseases (COVID-19 and pneumothorax). The proposed DSS system was evaluated using three independent standard-based chest X-ray scans. The suggested DSS predictor has been used to identify and classify areas on whole X-ray scans with abnormalities thought to be attributable to COVID-19, reaching an identification and classification accuracy rate of 89.58% for normal images and 89.13% for COVID-19 and pneumothorax. With the suggested DSS system, a judgment depending on individual chest X-ray scans may be made in approximately 0.01 s. As a result, the DSS system described in this study can forecast at a pace of 95 frames per second (FPS) for both models, which is near to real-time."

Optimizing the diagnosis and treatment of fluid overload remains a priority for the nephrology community. Although current methods of assessing fluid status, such as bioimpedance and lung ultrasound, have prognostic and diagnostic value, no single system or technique can be used to maintain euvolemia. The difficulty in maintaining and assessing fluid status led to a publication by the Kidney Health Initiative in 2019 aimed at fostering innovation in fluid management therapies. This review article focuses on the current limitations in our assessment of extracellular volume, and the novel technology and methods that can create a new paradigm for fluid management. The cardiology community has published research on multiparametric wearable devices that can create individualized predictions for heart failure events. In the future, similar wearable technology may be capable of tracking fluid changes during the interdialytic period and enabling behavioral change. Machine learning methods have shown promise in the prediction of volume-related adverse events. Similar methods can be leveraged to create accurate, automated predictions of dry weight that can potentially be used to guide ultrafiltration targets and interdialytic weight gain goals."

Over 4 million Americans are hospitalized every year due to heart failure (HF), with a median length of stay of 4 days and an in-hospital mortality rate that exceeds 5%. Hospitalizations of patients with HF can be prevented by early detection of lung congestion. Our study assessed a new contact-free optical medical device used for the early detection of lung congestion. Methods: The Gili system is an FDA-cleared device used for measuring chest motion vibration data. Lung congestion in the study was assessed clinically and verified via two cardiologists. An algorithm was developed using machine learning techniques, and cross-validation of the findings was performed to estimate the accuracy of the algorithm. Results: A total of 227 patients were recruited (101 cases vs. 126 controls).

Unfortunately, existing SV measurement methods are limited in the clinic because of their invasiveness (eg, thermodilution), location (eg, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging), or unreliability (eg, bioimpedance). Multimodal wearable sensing, leveraging the seismocardiogram, a sternal vibration signal associated with cardiomechanical activity, offers a means to monitoring SV conveniently, affordably, and continuously. However, it has not been evaluated in a population with significant anatomical and physiological differences (ie, children with CHD) or compared against a true gold standard (ie, cardiac magnetic resonance). Here, we present the feasibility of wearable estimation of SV in a diverse CHD population (N=45 patients). METHODS AND RESULTS: We used our chest-worn wearable biosensor to measure baseline ECG and seismocardiogram signals from patients with CHD before and after their routine cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging, and derived features from the measured signals, predominantly systolic time intervals, to estimate SV using ridge regression. Wearable signal features achieved acceptable SV estimation (28% error with respect to cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging) in a held-out test set, per cardiac output measurement guidelines, with a root-mean-square error of 11.48 mL and R2 of 0.76. Additionally, we observed that using a combination of electrical and cardiomechanical features surpassed the performance of either modality alone. CONCLUSIONS: A convenient wearable biosensor that estimates SV enables remote monitoring of cardiac function and may potentially help identify decompensation in patients with CHD."

Photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals non-invasively measured by wearable devices are extensively used to provide information about the cardiovascular system and its associated diseases. In this study, we propose an approach to optimize the quality assessment of the PPG signals. Methods: We used an ensemble-based feature selection scheme to enhance the prediction performance of the classification model to assess the quality of the PPG signals. Our approach for feature and subset size selection yielded the best-suited feature subset, which was optimized to differentiate between the clean and artifact corrupted PPG segments. Conclusion: A high discriminatory power was achieved between two classes on the test data by the proposed feature selection approach, which led to strong performance on all dependent and independent test datasets. We achieved accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity rates of higher than 0.93, 0.89, and 0.97, respectively, for dependent test datasets, independent of heartbeat type, i.e., atrial fibrillation (AF) or non-AF data including normal sinus rhythm (NSR), premature atrial contraction (PAC), and premature ventricular contraction (PVC). For independent test datasets, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity rates were greater than 0.93, 0.89, and 0.97, respectively, on PPG data recorded from AF and non-AF subjects. These results were found to be more accurate than those of all of the contemporary methods cited in this work. Significance: As the results illustrate, the advantage of our proposed scheme is its robustness against dynamic variations in the PPG signal during long-term 14-day recordings accompanied with different types of physical activities and a diverse range of fluctuations and waveforms caused by different individual hemodynamic characteristics, and various types of recording devices. This robustness instills confidence in the application of the algorithm to various kinds of wearable devices as a reliable PPG signal quality assessment approach."

Background: To improve current methods of diagnosis and objective monitoring of PD symptoms, wearable devices, and machine learning techniques have been used to develop solutions that enable remote monitoring [1]. One of the requirements to optimize monitoring is to ensure the quality of the data collected on ambulatory and remote settings, without the need for continuous supervision. Methods: Six subjects with PD participating in the TECAPARK project were recruited [2]. These participants wore a consumer smartwatch on the wrist of their most symptom-affected side. Data were captured weekly (eight weeks) during the performance of a set of eight standardized exercises selected from the MDS-UPDRS scale part 3. The automatic verification system was developed by using inertial signals of the SW treated with digital signal processing techniques and machine learning algorithms. The data were labeled by a clinical expert by observing video recordings made during the trials. Results: The highest accuracy in the error identification was obtained using the K-Nearest Neighbours classifier (KNN) trained with both triaxial gyroscope and triaxial accelerometer signals.

Purpose: To provide an accurate, accessible, and cost-effective AI-driven Single Lead STEMI detection algorithm that can be embedded into wearable devices and employed in a self-administered fashion. Methods: Database: EKG records from Mexico, Colombia, Argentina, and Brazil from April 2014 to December 2019. Dataset: A total of 11,567 12- lead EKG records of 10[s] length with a sampling frequency of 500 Hz, including the following balanced classes: Angiographically confirmed and unconfirmed STEMI, branch blocks, non-specific ST-T abnormalities, normal and abnormal (200+ CPT codes, excluding those mentioned above). Cardiologists manually checked the label of each record to ensure precision. Pre-processing: We discard the first and last 250 samples as they may contain a standardisation pulse. The study applied a digital low pass filter of order 5 with a frequency cut-off of 35 Hz. The mean was subtracted from each Lead. Classification: The determined classes were STEMI (Including STEMI in different locations of the myocardium - anterior, inferior, and lateral); and Not-STEMI (Combination of randomly sample, branch blocks, non-specific ST-T changes, and abnormal records - 25% of each). Training and Testing: A 1-D Convolutional Neural Network was trained and tested with a dataset proportion of 90/10, respectively. A different model was trained and tested for each Lead, using the central 4,500 samples of the records. The last dense layer outputs a probability for each report of being STEMI or Not-STEMI. Lead V2 showed the best overall results. The model was further tested through the same methodology using the best Lead with a subset of the previous data, excluding the unconfirmed STEMI EKG records (Total 7,230 12-lead EKG records for Confirmed Only STEMI dataset).

This work proposes an alternative cadence-measurement system with less of the mentioned restrictions, without the need for distinct cadence-measurement apparatus attached to the pedal and shaft of the road bicycle. The proposed design applies an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to the seating pole of the bike. In an experiment, the motion data were gathered.

In total, over 10 h of road cycling data were recorded and used to train the neural network. The network's aim was to detect each revolution of the crank within the data. The evaluation of the data has shown that using pure accelerometer data from all three axes led to the best result in combination with the proposed network architecture. A working proof of concept was achieved with an accuracy of approximately 95% on test data. As the proof of concept can also be seen as a new method for measuring cadence, the method was compared with the ground truth. Comparing the ground truth and the predicted cadence, it can be stated that for the relevant range of 50 rpm and above, the prediction over-predicts the cadence with approximately 0.9 rpm with a standard deviation of 2.05 rpm.

Current gait analysis methods, such as wearables or cameras, have privacy and operational constraints, especially when used with older adults. Millimeter-Wave (MMW) radar is a promising solution for gait applications because of its low-cost, better privacy, and resilience to ambient light and climate conditions. This paper presents a novel human gait analysis method that combines the micro-Doppler spectrogram and skeletal pose estimation using MMW radar for HAR. In our approach, we used the Texas Instruments IWR6843ISK-ODS MMW radar to obtain the micro-Doppler spectrogram and point clouds for 19 human joints. We developed a multilayer Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize and classify five different gait patterns with an accuracy of 95.7 to 98.8% using MMW radar data. During training of the CNN algorithm, we used the extracted 3D coordinates of 25 joints using the Kinect V2 sensor and compared them with the point clouds data to improve the estimation. Finally, we performed a real-time simulation to observe the point cloud behavior for different activities and validated our system against the ground truth values. The proposed method demonstrates the ability to distinguish between different human activities to obtain clinically relevant gait information."

However, it remains a critical challenge for hydrogel-based sensors to simultaneously achieve self-healing capability and adhesiveness for full-scale human motion biomonitoring. Herein, we proposed a multifunctional MXene/polyampholytes nanocomposite hydrogel. The main network of this hydrogel was formed by the one-step radical polymerization of cationic monomer and anionic monomer. The simultaneous strong and weak ionic bonds-based crosslinking inside this hydrogel endowed it outstanding stretchable, tough, self-healing, adhesive properties, while the introduction of MXene further guaranteed the excellent mechanical properties and conductivity of this hydrogel. Our further exploration of this MXene/polyampholytes in the application as wearable epidermal sensor strongly proved its durable accuracy and sensitivity for the detection of human motions. This epidermal sensor also could be assembled to the detector of the daily activity monitor of Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) patients, which could be utilized to aid the ADHD treatment by remindering the patients to pay attention to their actions.

Moreover, it can also inflate the costs of existing health care systems because of the many metabolic complications that it can cause. The current methods for assessing malnutrition can be cumbersome. A trained practitioner must be present to conduct an assessment, or patients must travel to facilities with specialized equipment to obtain their measurements. Therefore, digital health care is a possible way of closing this gap as it is rapidly gaining traction as a scalable means of improving efficiency in the health care system. It allows for the remote monitoring of nutritional status without requiring the physical presence of practitioners or the use of advanced medical equipment. As such, there is an increasing interest in expanding the range of digital applications to facilitate remote monitoring and management of health issues. In this study, we discuss the feasibility of a novel digital remote method for diagnosing malnutrition using facial morphometrics. Many malnutrition screening assessments include subjective assessments of the head and the face. Facial appearance is often used by clinicians as the first point of qualitative indication of health status. Hence, there may be merit in quantifying these subtle but observable changes using facial morphometrics. Modern advancements in artificial intelligence, data science, sensors, and computing technologies allow facial features to be accurately digitized, which could potentially allow these previously intuitive assessments to be quantified. This study aims to stimulate further discussion and discourse on how this emerging technology can be used to provide real-time access to nutritional status. The use of facial morphometrics extends the use of currently available technology and may provide a scalable, easily deployable solution for nutritional status to be monitored in real time. This will enable clinicians and dietitians to keep track of patients remotely and provide the necessary intervention measures as required, as well as providing health care institutions and policy makers with essential information that can be used to inform and enable targeted public health approaches within affected populations."

Such a feature enabled the bending sensor to simultaneously have a wide dynamic range of bending strain (0.025-5.4%), high gauge factor (∼74), and high linearity (R2 ∼ 0.99). Furthermore, the bending sensor can capture repeated instantaneous changes in strain and various types of vibrations, owing to its fast response time. Moreover, the bending direction can be differentiated with a single layer of the sensor, and using an array of sensors integrated on a glove, object recognition was demonstrated via machine learning. Finally, a self-monitoring proprioceptive ionic electroactive polymer (IEAP) actuator capable of operating in liquid was demonstrated. Such features of our bending sensor will enable a simple and effective way of detecting sophisticated motion, thus potentially advancing wearable healthcare monitoring electronics and enabling proprioceptive soft robotics."

Methods: We developed an Institutional Review Board–approved questionnaire to evaluate patient perceptions of remote monitoring technologies in a high-volume orthopedic center. Forty-seven THA patients (60% female; mean age: 66 years) and 50 nonoperative OA hip patients (52% female; mean age: 63 years) participated. Patient perceptions were compared using Pearson's chi-squared analyses. Results: THA patients were similarly interested in the use of smartphone apps (91% vs 94%, P =.695) in comparison to nonoperative hip OA patients. THA patients were more receptive to using wearable sensors (94% vs 44%, P <.001) relative to their nonoperative counterparts. THA patients also expressed stronger interest in learning to use custom wearables (87% vs 32%, P <.001) vs nonoperative patients. Likewise, the majority of THA patients were willing to use Global Positioning System technology (74% vs 26%, P <.001). THA patients also expressed willingness to have their body movement (89%), balance (89%), sleep (87%), and cardiac output (91%) tracked using remote technology. Conclusion: Overall, we found that THA patients were highly receptive to using wearable technology in their treatments. Nonoperative OA hip patients were generally unreceptive to using smart technologies, with the exception of smartphone applications.

Methods and analysis This prospective, randomised, open-label trial with blinded endpoint adjudication aimed to evaluate the efficacy of long-term home-based ECG monitoring for AF detection and stroke prevention in a 24-month period. Patients aged >18 years with a history of ischaemic stroke will be stratified according to the time from the index ischaemic stroke: <1, 1-3 and >3 years and then randomised in 1:1 to (1) home-based AF screening and (2) control. The home-based AF screening system comprises (1) a handheld single-lead ECG recorder (Comfit Healthcare Devices, Hong Kong SAR, China) and (2) a patient-facing smartphone application specially designed for the study. Patients randomised to the home-based AF group will record a 30 s single-lead ECG using a specially designed handheld ECG device every morning or when symptomatic. All remotely obtained data will be automatically transmitted in real-time through the study smartphone application to a secured cloud hosting and analysed using an artificial intelligence-based diagnostic system. When a diagnosis of AF is made with the system, the patients will be called back for a formal cardiology consultation within 1 week.

There is an increase in research for advanced AI techniques, such as deep learning, to build predictive models for the early detection of diseases. Such predictive models leverage mobile health (mHealth) data from wearable sensors and smartphones to discover novel ways for detecting and managing chronic diseases and mental health conditions. OBJECTIVE: Currently, little is known about the use of AI-powered mHealth (AIM) settings. Therefore, this scoping review aims to map current research on the emerging use of AIM for managing diseases and promoting health. Our objective is to synthesize research in AIM models that have increasingly been used for health care delivery in the last 2 years. METHODS: Using Arksey and O'Malley's 5-point framework for conducting scoping reviews, we reviewed AIM literature from the past 2 years in the fields of biomedical technology, AI, and information systems. We searched 3 databases, PubsOnline at INFORMS, e-journal archive at MIS Quarterly, and Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Digital Library using keywords such as ""mobile healthcare,"" ""wearable medical sensors,"" ""smartphones"", and ""AI."" We included AIM articles and excluded technical articles focused only on AI models. We also used the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) technique for identifying articles that represent a comprehensive view of current research in the AIM domain. RESULTS: We screened 108 articles focusing on developing AIM models for ensuring better health care delivery, detecting diseases early, and diagnosing chronic health conditions, and 37 articles were eligible for inclusion, with 31 of the 37 articles being published last year (76%). Of the included articles, 9 studied AI models to detect serious mental health issues, such as depression and suicidal tendencies, and chronic health conditions, such as sleep apnea and diabetes. Several articles discussed the application of AIM models for remote patient monitoring and disease management. The considered primary health concerns belonged to 3 categories: mental health, physical health, and health promotion and wellness. Moreover, 14 of the 37 articles used AIM applications to research physical health, representing 38% of the total studies. Finally, 28 out of the 37 (76%) studies used proprietary data sets rather than public data sets. We found a lack of research in addressing chronic mental health issues and a lack of publicly available data sets for AIM research. CONCLUSIONS: The application of AIM models for disease detection and management is a growing research domain. These models provide accurate predictions for enabling preventive care on a broader scale in the health care domain. Given the ever-increasing need for remote disease management during the pandemic, recent AI techniques, such as federated learning and explainable AI, can act as a catalyst for increasing the adoption of AIM and enabling secure data sharing across the health care industry."

The study group consisted of 41 STEMI patients and 49 control patients referred for elective coronary angiography and having normal left ventricular function and no valvular heart disease or arrhythmia. MCG signals were recorded on the upper sternum in supine position upon arrival to the catheterization laboratory. In this study, we used a dedicated wearable sensor equipped with 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis gyroscope and 1-lead ECG in order to facilitate the detection of STEMI in a clinically meaningful way. A supervised machine learning approach was used. Stability of beat morphology, signal strength, maximum amplitude and its timing were calculated in six axes from each window with varying band-pass filters in 2-90 Hz range. In total, 613 features were investigated. Using logistic regression classifier and leave-one-person-out cross validation we obtained a sensitivity of 73.9%, specificity of 85.7% and AUC of 0.857 (SD = 0.005) using 150 best features. As a result, mechanical signals recorded on the upper chest wall with the accelerometers and gyroscopes differ significantly between STEMI patients and stable patients with normal left ventricular function. Future research will show whether MCG can be used for the early screening of STEMI."

MXene is regarded as one of the most ideal candidate sensing materials due to its high electrical conductivity and controllable interlayer space. However, the easy-to-oxidize characteristic of MXene materials greatly restricts the sensitivity and reliability of sensor devices, especially in wet climates. Herein, a highly sensitive and waterproof flexible pressure sensor using a free-standing hydrophobic bacterial cellulose/Ti3C2Tx MXene (HBT) hybrid film as a sensing layer is fabricated by facile and effective nanocellulose intercalation and fluorine modification strategies.

Recent advances in mobile technologies and wearable sensors have enabled continuous remote monitoring of patients with MDD. Here we discuss the replication results of personalized (N of 1) relapse prediction framework using actigraphy data and self-reported symptoms to predict relapse and recurrence in MDD. Methods: The personalized (N of 1) relapse prediction framework encompasses a LSTM based Anomaly Detection using fractal and entropy activity features. Once anomaly was predicted in a patient’s activity data, the risk of relapse was confirmed by a pre-specified rule-based algorithm of self-reported questions (VQIDS-5, GAD-7). This personalized framework was developed and evaluated in an observation trial ORBIT (NCT02489305, N=211) followed by confirmation in an independent trial Wellness (NCT02934334, N=46) in MDD patients with longitudinal data collection (≥1 year) of self-reported assessments, continuous activity monitoring and regular bimonthly clinic visits with MADRS based relapse assessment. Results: The personalized framework achieved a balanced accuracy (BAC) of 0.74 with a median time of detection (TOD) of 21 days in ORBIT across 1190 clinic visits and achieved a comparable performance with a BAC of 0.71 and a median TOD of 14 days in Wellness across 148 clinic visits. Conclusions: The predictive ability of a personalized (N of 1) relapse prediction framework was demonstrated in an observational MDD study confirmed by the replication trial. The proposed framework predicted majority of relapses and recurrences with low provider, patient burden with considerable lead-in time for possible relapse and recurrence preemption.

A tiny single-patch monitor is more convenient than a conventional Holter monitor recording device and, therefore, longer duration of monitoring may be acceptable. Methods and Design: The CANDLE-AF study is a multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled trial. Patients with transient ischemic attack or ischemic stroke without any history of AF will be enrolled. The superiority of the 72-h single-patch monitor to standard strategy and non-inferiority of the 72-h single-patch monitor to an event-recorder-type device will be investigated. Single-patch monitor arm will repeat monitoring at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, event-recorder-type arm will repeat monitoring twice daily for 12 months. The enrollment goal is a total of 600 patients, and the primary outcome is the detection of AF which continues at least 30 s during study period. The secondary outcome is the rate of changes from antiplatelet to anticoagulant and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events within 1 year. Conclusions: The results of CANDLE-AF will clarify the role of a single-lead patch ECG for the early detection of AF in patients with acute ischemic stroke. In addition, the secondary outcome will be analyzed to determine whether more sensitive AF detection can affect the prognosis and if further device development is meaningful.

Insoles instrumented with force-sensitive resistors (FSRs) are an unobtrusive, low-cost, and low-power technology for sampling GRF and CoP in real-world environments. However, FSRs have variable response characteristics that complicate estimation of GRF and CoP. This study introduces a unique data analytic pipeline that enables accurate estimation of GRF and CoP despite relatively inaccurate FSR responses. This paper also investigates whether inclusion of a complementary knee angle sensor improves estimation accuracy. Methods: Seventeen healthy subjects were equipped with an insole instrumented with six FSRs and a string-based knee angle sensor. Subjects walked in a straight line at self-selected slow, preferred, and fast speeds over an in-ground force platform. Twenty repetitions were performed for each speed. Supervised machine learning models estimated weight-normalized GRF and shoe size-normalized CoP, which were re-scaled to obtain GRF and CoP. Results: Anteroposterior GRF, Vertical GRF, and Anteroposterior CoP were estimated with a normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of less than 5%. Mediolateral GRF and CoP were estimated with an NRMSE of 8.1% and 6.4%, respectively. Knee angle-related features slightly improved GRF estimates. Conclusion: Normalized models accurately estimated GRF and CoP despite deficiencies in FSR data. Significance: Ambulatory use of the proposed system could enable objective, longitudinal monitoring of severity and progression for a variety of health conditions."

The health and functional capacity are a prerequisite for active elderly, which emphasizes the intermediary role of technology in quality of life. We implemented a technological strategy, based on Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), for health services. Developing a remote monitoring system for the elderly, which captures patient information 24 hours a day through wearable devices. Currently it is possible for Senior Mobile Health professionals to provide continuous evaluation about elderly health, offering crucial data for the prediction of adverse health conditions through smart algorithms. Therefore, the main goal of this study was to show the development of remote monitoring system and its functionally. The system consists in a web dashboard to store and view the information about the health indicators, mobile app to facility the data collect by the health professionals during the intervention and smart algorithms developed from the sensors. Methods: The Senior Mobile Health (SMH) platform has a microservice architecture, with several services connected to user and information management, data science and IoT. Most of the artificial intelligence algorithms work with time series analysis and machine learning to monitor important data on the health of the elderly. Using sensors as accelerometer, gyroscope, global position system (GPS) and the photoplethysmography sensor, we developed smart algorithms to follow the health indicators such as heart rate variability, nocturia, gait speed and others. The mobile app is designed to encourage elderly in their self-care through specific goals and activities. Results: By using wearable devices, mobile application and web dashboard, the smart algorithms of the SMH platform predict adverse health outcomes and promote real-time and continuous monitoring of the elderly health. Such algorithms are currently analyzing, for example, heart rate variability, steps, nocturia, quality of sleep and gait speed, which are closely linked to adverse outcomes in the health of the elderly. These functionalities are important in human aging process. The SMH platform receives heart rate data from the wearable devices and transform the data in information about Heart Rate Variability (HRV). The HRV reflects the oscillations in the interval between consecutive heartbeats that result mainly from the dynamic interaction between the parasympathetic and the sympathetic system. The changes in HRV patterns provide information about the decline in health, mainly the cognitive functioning. Step counting sensors, as accelerometers, can be able to daily monitor the activity level and the number of steps each day. They can be used also as a strategy to motivate the elderly to remain active through established previously goals by the health professionals. Recent studies show how many steps a day are enough for specific populations as elderly to be considered as free of chronic disease and active, or as elderly with chronic disease and sedentary lifestyle. Thereby, using the SMH platform, patients are monitored, and specific profiles are created. The nocturia is a condition in which an individual has to wake up at night many times to urination, which each urination being preceded and followed by sleep. By using sensors as accelerometers and photoplethysmography to analyze the movements and steps at night, besides the heartbeats analysis with the smart algorithms, the SMH platform can be able to identify how many times the individual wake up at night and go to the bathroom. These conditions can be associate with serious illnesses such as prostate cancer, diabetes, and others. Sleep disturbances are common symptoms among the people. However, previous studies show that elderly become more vulnerable to sleep disorders than other individuals, showing a decreasing global sleep time at night, increasing sleep latency, with sleep-wake cycle disorders, especially excessive daytime sleepiness. The monitoring of sleep patterns and sleep quality can be useful to assess the sleep influences on outcomes that interfere in the elderly health. The gait speed has been used as another important metrics to monitor. Gait speed patterns change can be markers of various general medical conditions, including, cognitive decline, and increased chance of falls, hospitalizations, or even death. The high association between gait speed and clinical adverse outcome become this measure an important information and widely used. The platform proposal is to automatically obtain this information from devices, decreasing and facilitating the work of health professionals. This platform has been implemented in several places such as public and private Brazilian hospitals to monitoring the inpatients, an Elderly Community Center to following active older adults, a Condominium for Senior to create a digital environment and other. Conclusion: This paper presented the SMH platform, a system oriented to the elderly care. The platform is registered in the Brazilian National Institute of Intellectual Property, with the patent BR512020002492-0. Results show that the platform provides interesting features of elderly monitoring."

Innovations made using technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), edge computing, cloud computing and artificial intelligence are helping address this crisis. The urge for remote monitoring, symptom analysis and early detection of diseases lead to tremendous increase in the deployment of wearable sensor devices. They facilitate seamless gathering of physiological data such as electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, respiration traces (RESP), galvanic skin response (GSR), pulse rate, body temperature, photoplethysmograms (PPG), oxygen saturation (SpO2) etc. For diagnosis and analysis purpose, the gathered data needs to be stored. Wearable devices operate on batteries and have a memory constraint. In mHealth application architectures, this gathered data is hence stored on cloud based servers. While transmitting data from wearable devices to cloud servers via edge devices, a lot of energy is consumed. This paper proposes a deep learning based compression model SCAElite that reduces the data volume, enabling energy efficient transmission. Results: Stress Recognition in Automobile Drivers dataset and MIT-BIH dataset from PhysioNet are used for validation of algorithm performance. The model achieves a compression ratio of up to 300 fold with reconstruction errors within 8% over the stress recognition dataset and 106.34-fold with reconstruction errors within 8% over the MIT-BIH dataset. The computational complexity of SCAElite is 51.65% less compared to state-of-the-art deep compressive model. Conclusion: It is experimentally validated that SCAElite guarantees a high compression ratio with good quality restoration capabilities for physiological signal compression in mHealth applications. It has a compact architecture and is computationally more efficient compared to state-of-the-art deep compressive model."

Upon electrolyte absorption, the CYSAB can be rapidly activated. Its performance is closely related to the ion concentration, infiltrated electrolyte volume, and evaporation rate. The CYSAB can tolerate repeated bending and washing without any significant influence on its power output. Moreover, the CYSABs can be woven into fabrics and connected in series and parallel configurations to produce an energy supplying headband, which can be activated by the sweat secreted from a volunteer during a cycling exercise to power light-emitting diode headlights. The developed CYSAB can also be integrated with yarn-based strain sensors to achieve a smart textile for the self-powered sensing of human motion and breathing.

Falls risk assessment typically requires a face-to-face evaluation delivered by a trained professional in a clinical setting, thus limiting their application for many older people with falls. Therefore, there is a need for a remote monitoring system (RMS) that captures mobility data to assess comprehensively an older individual's true falls risk undertaking their everyday activities in their usual environment. Methods: A pilot study was conducted with 16 participants over 65 years classified as high (n = 9) or low falls risk (n = 7) based on their fall's history. A RMS was developed, which combines inertial measurement unit (IMU) data from a wearable device and online realtime Machine Learning (ML) to generate a two-stage fall risk assessment. In stage one, a ML activity motion classifier identified raw IMU data from participants as either, walking, resting or transitional movements (turning or sitting to standing). In stage two, previously classifiedmotion segments were analysed by aML fall-risk classifier, providing an Objective risk assessment based on gait characteristics during everyday motion. Falls incidence was recorded prospectively at one year follow-up. Results: The motion classifier achieved an 94.8% accuracy in differentiating between resting, walking and transitional movements. The fall risk classifier initially trained with retrospective fall history data achieved an 87.5% accuracy with 88.9% sensitivity and specificity, which is comparable to other accurate classifiers in published literature. The fall risk classifier retrained with prospective one year follow-up data achieved a 73% accuracy which was superior to the 67% accuracy of the Timed Up and Go test for falls prediction. Conclusion: Our study shows the potential of a machine-learning remote monitoring system using information from mobility data to classify an older person's falls' risk."

For most of history, mental health disorders have been chiefly defined by the subjective experiences of people with these disorders - we know people have a depressive disorder because they feel depressed or that they have a psychotic disorder because they experience hallucinations. The lack of objective markers to track changes in mental health symptoms creates barriers to treatment. To address this, the vision of KeyWise AI is the further development and commercialization of an innovative digital phenotyping technology that turns smartphones into fitness trackers for the brain. We first describe how we commercialized findings derived from the ongoing citizen science BiAffect study and how our brain fitness-tracking technology supports real-time passive and unobtrusive modeling and monitoring of emotional, behavioral and cognitive processes. The core technology centers around a custom-built smartphone keyboard that replaces the default keyboard, thus allowing for unobtrusive collection of anonymized keyboard dynamics and motor kinetics metadata. We conclude this paper with some general guidelines that may help future academic entrepreneurs on their startup journey."

Modern, high-speed wireless communication technologies that employ complex network and communication protocols and standards have quickly supplanted the traditional wired scheme of communication. Wireless medical sensor networks are a promising application of WSNs in healthcare since they allow for remote patient monitoring (WMSNs). Reliable patient communication, patient mobility, and energy-efficient routing are at the forefront of current WMSN healthcare research developments. Nonetheless, patients' personal information is at risk when new technologies are implemented in healthcare applications without proper security measures being taken. In this study, we present a privacy-preserving strategy for the secure transfer of medical records over WSNs by combining secret sharing, and hashing. The healthcare information gathered by a wireless sensor network is broken down into subsets. In addition, a popular hashing algorithm is used to determine a unique identifier for each constituent. Any alterations to the message will result in a different hash value. Multipath routing is then used to send these parts to the servers. In order to verify the efficacy of the new method, this paper presents comprehensive simulations. The results indicate that secret splitting, in conjunction with multipath routing, aids in the maintenance of confidentiality in a wireless sensor network-based healthcare scheme."

HAR results are useful in monitoring a person's health, and the system predicts abnormal activities based on user movements. The HAR system's abnormal activity predictions provide better healthcare monitoring and reduce users' health issues. The conventional HAR systems use wearable sensors, such as inertial measurement unit (IMU) and stretch sensors for activity recognition. These approaches show remarkable performances to the user's basic activities such as sitting, standing, and walking. However, when the user performs complex activities, such as running, jumping, and lying, the sensor-based HAR systems have a higher degree of misclassification results due to the reading errors from sensors.

In this context, digital measures may be used to measure the risk of certain adverse events such as falls, and also to provide novel research insights into ageing and ageing-related conditions, like cognitive impairment. While major emphasis has been placed on deriving one or more digital measures from wearable devices, a more holistic approach inspired by systems biology that leverages large, non-exhaustive sets of digital measures may prove highly beneficial. Such an approach would be useful if combined with modern big data approaches like machine learning. As such, extensive sets of digital measures, which may be referred to as digital behavioromes, could help characterise new phenotypes in deep phenotyping efforts. These measures could also assist in the discovery of novel digital biomarkers or in the creation of digital clinical outcome assessments. While clinical research into digital measures focuses primarily on measures derived from wearable devices, proven technology used for long-term remote monitoring of older adults is generally contactless, unobtrusive, and privacy-preserving. In this context, we introduce and describe a digital behaviorome: a large, non-exhaustive set of digital measures based entirely on contactless, unobtrusive, and privacy-preserving sensor technologies.

Intraclass correlation coefficients, ICC(2,k), between the estimated parameters and the reference data resulted in good-to-excellent agreement (ICC ≥ 0.84) for the lumbar and shin sensors, excluding the double support time (ICC = 0.37 lumbar and 0.38 shin) and swing time (ICC = 0.55 lumbar and 0.59 shin). The wrist sensor also showed good agreements, but the ICCs were lower overall than for the other two sensors. Our proposed analysis pipeline has the potential to extract up to 100 gait-related parameters, and we expect our contribution will further support developments in the fields of wearable sensors, digital health, and remote monitoring in clinical trials."

Multiple frameworks have been proposed to mine, store, preprocess, and analyze physiological vitals data using artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms. Comparatively, less research has been done to collect potentially high volume, high-quality ‘big data’ in an organized, time-synchronized, and holistic manner to solve similar problems in multiple fields. Although a large number of data collection devices exist in the form of sensors. They are either highly specialized, univariate and fragmented in nature or exist in a lab setting. The current study aims to propose artificial intelligence-based body sensor network framework (AIBSNF), a framework for strategic use of body sensor networks (BSN), which combines with real-time location system (RTLS) and wearable biosensors to collect multivariate, low noise, and high-fidelity data. This facilitates gathering of time-synchronized location and physiological vitals data, which allows artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML)-based time series analysis. The study gives a brief overview of wearable sensor technology, RTLS, and provides use cases of AI/ML algorithms in the field of sensor fusion. The study also elaborates sample scenarios using a specific sensor network consisting of pressure sensors (insoles), accelerometers, gyroscopes, ECG, EMG, and RTLS position detectors for particular applications in the field of health care and sports. The AIBSNF may provide a solid blueprint for conducting research and development, forming a smooth end-to-end pipeline from data collection using BSN, RTLS and final stage analytics based on AI/ML algorithms."

In the setting of limited healthcare resources, outpatient management of individuals newly diagnosed with COVID-19 was commonly implemented, some taking advantage of various personal health technologies, but only rarely using a multi-parameter chest-patch for continuous monitoring. Here we describe the development and validation of a COVID-19 decompensation index (CDI) model based on chest patch-derived continuous sensor data to predict COVID-19 hospitalizations in outpatient-managed COVID-19 positive individuals, achieving an overall AUC of the ROC Curve of 0.84 on 308 event negative participants, and 22 event positive participants, out of an overall study cohort of 400 participants. We retrospectively compare the performance of CDI to standard of care modalities, finding that the machine learning model outperforms the standard of care modalities in terms of both numbers of events identified and with a lower false alarm rate. While only a pilot phase study, the CDI represents a promising application of machine learning within a continuous remote patient monitoring system."

Four Epilog sensors are combined as part of Epitel's Remote EEG Monitoring platform (REMI) to create 10 channels of EEG for remote patient monitoring. REMI is designed to provide comprehensive spatial EEG recordings that can be administered by non-specialized medical personnel in any medical center. The purpose of this study was to determine how accurate epileptologists are at remotely reviewing Epilog sensor EEG in the 10-channel “REMI montage,” with and without seizure detection support software. Three board certified epileptologists reviewed the REMI montage from 20 subjects who wore four Epilog sensors for up to 5 days alongside traditional video-EEG in the EMU, 10 of whom experienced a total of 24 focal-onset electrographic seizures and 10 of whom experienced no seizures or epileptiform activity. Epileptologists randomly reviewed the same datasets with and without clinical decision support annotations from an automated seizure detection algorithm tuned to be highly sensitive. Blinded consensus review of unannotated Epilog EEG in the REMI montage detected people who were experiencing electrographic seizure activity with 90% sensitivity and 90% specificity. Consensus detection of individual focal onset seizures resulted in a mean sensitivity of 61%, precision of 80%, and false detection rate (FDR) of 0.002 false positives per hour (FP/h) of data. With algorithm seizure detection annotations, the consensus review mean sensitivity improved to 68% with a slight increase in FDR (0.005 FP/h). As seizure detection software, the automated algorithm detected people who were experiencing electrographic seizure activity with 100% sensitivity and 70% specificity, and detected individual focal onset seizures with a mean sensitivity of 90% and mean false alarm rate of 0.087 FP/h. This is the first study showing epileptologists' ability to blindly review EEG from four Epilog sensors in the REMI montage, and the results demonstrate the clinical potential to accurately identify patients experiencing electrographic seizures.

Particularly, to assess the impact of these technologies in clinical decision-making, this research considers technical and medical aspects. Results: On one hand, some devices in heart failure, atrial fibrillation and cardiac rehabilitation represent an inexpensive, not invasive or not very invasive approach to long-term surveillance and management in these areas. On the other hand, the availability of large datasets (big data) is a useful tool to predict the development and outcome of many cardiovascular diseases.

Design: Activities were classified using computational methods and compared to manually tagged activities performed in random order by PD subjects during a cross-sectional study. Setting: Activities were performed in the Motion Analysis lab at an outpatient rehabilitation center. Participants: Five PD subjects (mean age: 63.5±2.6 years, mean Hoehn-Yahr score: 2) performed activities during the on-medication state. Interventions: Four wearable sensors were used to capture the motion of subjects during a parkour of six activities. Motion data were used to train and test four discriminant analysis methods. Main Outcome Measures: Three-dimensional components and magnitudes of acceleration and angular rate of sensors located on the foot, thigh, pelvis, and wrist were registered at a sampling rate of 250 Hz. Data were preprocessed using a lowpass 2nd order Butterworth filter with a cutoff frequency of 5 Hz and smoothed using a moving-average filter with a window size of 6.4 s. Thirteen predictors were used to train and test 4 discriminant analysis methods: linear, quadratic, naïve Bayes (NB) with normal, and NB with kernel distribution. The skewness and normality of each predictor were calculated. Discriminant analysis methods were validated using the 5-fold cross-validation method. Accuracy for each method was calculated. All data processing analysis was performed in Matlab 2020. Results: A total of 179,555 observations were used to train and validate discriminant analysis methods. None of the predictors showed a normal distribution and 6 of them presented high skewness. The lowest accuracy was obtained by linear discriminant analysis (55.9%). Best accuracy was obtained for naïve Bayes with kernel distribution (60.7%) because it does not require normally distributed data and supports skewness in predictors. Conclusions: Discriminant analysis using naïve Bayes with kernel distribution has the potential to identify activities that could be helpful to support remote monitoring of the performance of PD subjects using wearable sensors.

Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an intelligent monitoring system for improving CPAP compliance. Methods: This is a prospective, open label, parallel, randomized controlled trial including 60 newly diagnosed patients with OSA requiring CPAP (Apnea-Hypopnea Index [AHI] >15) from Lleida, Spain. Participants were randomized (1:1) to standard management or the MiSAOS intelligent monitoring system, involving (1) early compliance detection, thus providing measures of patient's CPAP compliance from the very first days of usage; (2) machine learning-based prediction of midterm future CPAP compliance; and (3) rule-based recommendations for the patient (app) and care team. Clinical and anthropometric variables, daytime sleepiness, and quality of life were recorded at baseline and after 6 months, together with patient's compliance, satisfaction, and health care costs. Results: Randomized patients had a mean age of 57 (SD 11) years, mean AHI of 50 (SD 27), and 13% (8/60) were women. Patients in the intervention arm had a mean (95% CI) of 1.14 (0.04-2.23) hours/day higher adjusted CPAP compliance than controls (P=.047). Patients' satisfaction was excellent in both arms, and up to 88% (15/17) of intervention patients reported willingness to keep using the MiSAOS app in the future. No significant differences were found in costs (control: mean €90.2 (SD 53.14) (US $105.76 [SD 62.31]); intervention: mean €96.2 (SD 62.13) (US $112.70 [SD 72.85]); P=.70; €1=US $1.17 was considered throughout). Overall costs combined with results on compliance demonstrated cost-effectiveness in a bootstrap-based simulation analysis. Conclusions: A machine learning-based intelligent monitoring system increased daily compliance, reported excellent patient satisfaction similar to that reported in usual care, and did not incur in a substantial increase in costs, thus proving cost-effectiveness. This study supports the implementation of intelligent eHealth frameworks for the management of patients with CPAP-treated OSA and confirms the value of patients' empowerment in the management of chronic diseases."

The lessons learned from the soft launch are used to modify and fine-tune the workflow process and study protocol. METHODS: This soft launch was conducted at NorthShore University HealthSystem's Evanston Hospital from December 2020 to March 2021. Patients were provided with non-invasive wearable biosensors that continuously collect ambulatory physiological data, and a study phone that collects patient-reported outcomes. The physiological data are analyzed by machine learning algorithms, potentially identifying physiological perturbation in HF patients. Alerts from this algorithm may be cascaded with other patient status data to inform home health nurses' (HHNs') management via a structured protocol. HHNs review the monitoring platform daily. If the patient's status meets specific criteria, HHNs perform assessments and escalate patient cases to the HF team for further guidance on early intervention. RESULTS: We enrolled five patients into the soft launch. Four participants adhered to study activities. Two out of five patients were readmitted, one due to HF, one due to infection. Observed miscommunication and protocol gaps were noted for protocol amendment. The study team adopted an organizational development method from change management theory to reconfigure the study protocol. CONCLUSION: We sought to automate the monitoring aspects of post-discharge care by aligning a new technology that generates streaming data from a wearable device with a complex, multi-provider workflow into a novel protocol using iterative design, implementation, and evaluation methods to monitor post-discharge HF patients. CRPM with structured escalation and telemonitoring protocol shows potential to maintain patients in their home environment and reduce HF-related readmissions.

In this context, various types of devices have been fabricated and developed to monitor different breath rates. However, the disposability and biocompatibility of such sensors and the poor classification of different breath rates from sensor data are significant issues in medical services. This report attempts to focus on two important things: the classification of respiration signals from sensor data using deep learning and the disposability of devices. The use of the novel Janus MoSSe quantum dot (MoSSe QD) structure allows for stable respiration sensing because of unchanged wear rates under humid conditions, and also, the electron affinity and work function values suggest that MoSSe has a higher tendency to donate electrons and interact with the hydrogen molecule. Furthermore, for the real-time classification of different respiration signals, a 1D convolutional neural network (1D CNN) was incorporated. This algorithm was applied to four different breath patterns which achieved a state-of-the-art 10-trial accuracy of 98.18% for normal, 95.25% for slow, 97.64% for deep, and 98.18% for fast breaths.

Estimated to account for around 26 million people worldwide, diagnosed patients present a poor prognosis and quality of life with a clinical history accompanied by repeated hospital admissions caused by an exacerbation of their chronic condition. The frequent hospitalizations and the extended hospital stays mean an extremely high economic burden for healthcare institutions. Meanwhile, the number of chronically diseased and elderly patients is continuously rising, and a lack of specialized physicians is evident. To cope with this health emergency, more efficient strategies for patient management, more accurate diagnostic tools, and more efficient preventive plans are needed.

The majority of complications are infection and bowelrelated. Modern Bluetooth-enabled commercial wearable devices such as smart watches can measure and transmit a patient's health data directly to a mobile phone. Data is either stored on the phone for future retrieval or uploaded to a web server in real-time to facilitate remote patient monitoring. In this study, we test the feasibility of remote monitoring for 30 days in patients discharged from hospital following RC. METHODS: As part of the DREAMPath (ISRCTN62293620) study, patients were provided with an iPhone, Apple Watch Series 4 and three Bluetooth peripherals (sphygmomanometer, pulse oximeter, thermometer). They were instructed to wear the Apple Watch at all times, and measure their observations twice a day. Additionally, patients were asked to complete a quality of recovery 15 questionnaire daily. At the end of 30 days, re-admission data was collected. A backend data pipeline has also been developed to process collected data, allowing us to develop clinically-useful analytics. The primary focus is on developing anomaly detection and machine learning models that predict premature hospital re-admission. RESULTS: 20 patients have been recruited into the study. At the time of our analysis, 5,687 data points have been collected per patient during the month of monitoring. Four patients were re-admitted: reasons for admission are pulmonary embolism (1), infection (2) and stent problems (1) respectively. Prior to each re-admission, the model constructed around these physiological measures was able to predict re-admission > 48 hours prior to patient-initiated visit to hospital accident and emergency department, except for the patient with stent problems. The patient with stent symptoms was identified due to reduction in their daily questionnaire score. CONCLUSIONS: Remote monitoring is feasible, and patients can engage with it with minimal effort all while generating a large amount of data that is relevant to their recovery. In this small study, we show that it is possible to detect physiological disturbances before patients feel unwell enough to be re-admitted to hospital. It would be informative to design an intervention to triage these patients earlier in an effort to reduce total re-admission days."

The aims of this study were firstly to employ deep neural networks to convert IMU data to ankle joint angles that are indistinguishable from those derived from motion capture-based inverse kinematics (IK) - the reference standard; and secondly, to validate the robustness of this approach across contrasting walking speeds in healthy individuals. Kinematics data were simultaneously calculated using IMUs and IK from 9 subjects during walking on a treadmill at 0.5 m/s, 1.0 m/s and 1.5 m/s. A generative adversarial network was trained using gait data at two of the walking speeds to predict ankle kinematics from IMU data alone for the third walking speed. There were significant differences between IK and IMU joint angle predictions for ankle eversion and internal rotation during walking at 0.5 m/s and 1.0 m/s (p < 0.001); however, no significant differences in joint angles were observed between the generative adversarial network prediction and IK at any speed or plane of joint motion (p < 0.05). The RMS difference in ankle joint kinematics between the generative adversarial network and IK for walking at 1.0 m/s was 3.8°, 2.1° and 3.5° for dorsiflexion, inversion and axial rotation, respectively. The modeling approach presented for real-time IMU to ankle joint angle conversion, which can be readily expanded to other joints, may provide enhanced IMU capability in applications such as telemedicine, remote monitoring and rehabilitation."

Taking the Fried frailty criteria as a reference to determine physical frailty and frailty phenotypes (slowness, weakness, exhaustion, inactivity), this study aimed to explore the benefit of machine learning to determine the least number of digital biomarkers of physical frailty measurable from a pendant sensor during activities of daily living. Two hundred and fifty-nine older adults were classified into robust or pre-frail/frail groups based on the physical frailty assessments by the Fried frailty criteria. All participants wore a pendant sensor at the sternum level for 48 h. Of seventeen sensor-derived features extracted from a pendant sensor, fourteen significant features were used for machine learning based on logistic regression modeling and a recursive feature elimination technique incorporating bootstrapping. The combination of percentage time standing, percentage time walking, walking cadence, and longest walking bout were identified as optimal digital biomarkers of physical frailty and frailty phenotypes. These findings suggest that a combination of sensor-measured exhaustion, inactivity, and speed have potential to screen and monitor people for physical frailty and frailty phenotypes."

The poor reliability of self-reported seizure diaries for many people with epilepsy is well-established, but these records remain necessary in clinical care and therapeutic studies. A number of wearable devices have emerged, which may be capable of detecting seizures, recording seizure data, and alerting caregivers. Developments in non-invasive wearable sensors to measure accelerometry, photoplethysmography (PPG), electrodermal activity (EDA), electromyography (EMG), and other signals outside of the traditional clinical environment may be able to identify seizure-related changes. Non-invasive scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and minimally invasive subscalp EEG may allow direct measurement of seizure activity. However, significant network and computational infrastructure is needed for continuous, secure transmission of data. The large volume of data acquired by these devices necessitates computer-assisted review and detection to reduce the burden on human reviewers. Furthermore, user acceptability of such devices must be a paramount consideration to ensure adherence with long-term device use. Such devices can identify tonic–clonic seizures, but identification of other seizure semiologies with non-EEG wearables is an ongoing challenge. Identification of electrographic seizures with subscalp EEG systems has recently been demonstrated over long (>6 month) durations, and this shows promise for accurate, objective seizure records. While the ability to detect and forecast seizures from ambulatory intracranial EEG is established, invasive devices may not be acceptable for many individuals with epilepsy. Recent studies show promising results for probabilistic forecasts of seizure risk from long-term wearable devices and electronic diaries of self-reported seizures. There may also be predictive value in individuals' symptoms, mood, and cognitive performance. However, seizure forecasting requires perpetual use of a device for monitoring, increasing the importance of the system's acceptability to users. Furthermore, long-term studies with concurrent EEG confirmation are lacking currently. This review describes the current evidence and challenges in the use of minimally and non-invasive devices for long-term epilepsy monitoring, the essential components in remote monitoring systems, and explores the feasibility to detect and forecast impending seizures via long-term use of these systems."

However, traditional plastic or elastomer substrates with impermeability, uncomfortableness, mechanical mismatches, and nondegradability greatly restricted their practical applications. Therefore, the fabrication of such pressure sensors with high flexibility, facile degradability, and breathability is still a critical challenge and highly desired. Herein, we present a wearable, breathable, degradable, and highly sensitive MXene/protein nanocomposites-based pressure sensor. The fabricated MXene/protein-based pressure sensor is assembled from a breathable conductive MXene coated silk fibroin nanofiber (MXene-SF) membrane and a silk fibroin nanofiber membrane patterned with a MXene ink-printed (MXene ink-SF) interdigitated electrode, which can serve as the sensing layer and the electrode layer, respectively. The assembled pressure sensor exhibits a wide sensing range (up to 39.3 kPa), high sensitivity (298.4 kPa-1 for 1.4-15.7 kPa; 171.9 kPa-1 for 15.7-39.3 kPa), fast response/recovery time (7/16 ms), reliable breathability, excellent cycling stability over 10 000 cycles, good biocompatibility, and robust degradability. Furthermore, it shows great sensing performance in monitoring human psychological signals, acting as an artificial skin for the quantitative illustration of pressure distribution, and wireless biomonitoring in real time. Considering the biodegradable and breathable features, the sensor may become promising to find potential applications in smart electronic skins, human motion detection, disease diagnosis, and human-machine interaction."

Innovative, practical strategies to improve monitoring of glycemic health are desperately needed. In this proof-of-concept study, we explore the relationship between non-invasive wearables and glycemic metrics and demonstrate the feasibility of using non-invasive wearables to estimate glycemic metrics, including hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and glucose variability metrics. Research design and methods We recorded over 25 000 measurements from a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) with simultaneous wrist-worn wearable (skin temperature, electrodermal activity, heart rate, and accelerometry sensors) data over 8-10 days in 16 participants with normal glycemic state and pre-diabetes (HbA1c 5.2-6.4). We used data from the wearable to develop machine learning models to predict HbA1c recorded on day 0 and glucose variability calculated from the CGM. We tested the accuracy of the HbA1c model on a retrospective, external validation cohort of 10 additional participants and compared results against CGM-based HbA1c estimation models. Results A total of 250 days of data from 26 participants were collected. Out of the 27 models of glucose variability metrics that we developed using non-invasive wearables, 11 of the models achieved high accuracy (<10% mean average per cent error, MAPE). Our HbA1c estimation model using non-invasive wearables data achieved MAPE of 5.1% on an external validation cohort. The ranking of wearable sensor's importance in estimating HbA1c was skin temperature (33%), electrodermal activity (28%), accelerometry (25%), and heart rate (14%). Conclusions This study demonstrates the feasibility of using non-invasive wearables to estimate glucose variability metrics and HbA1c for glycemic monitoring and investigates the relationship between non-invasive wearables and the glycemic metrics of glucose variability and HbA1c. The methods used in this study can be used to inform future studies confirming the results of this proof-of-concept study."

If the HT is diagnosed early, effective treatment can control the BP and avert adverse outcomes. Physiological signals like electrocardiography (ECG), photoplethysmography (PPG), heart rate variability (HRV), and ballistocardiography (BCG) can be used to monitor health status but are not directly correlated with BP measurements. The manual detection of HT using these physiological signals is time consuming and prone to human errors. Hence, many computer-aided diagnosis systems have been developed. This paper is a systematic review of studies conducted on the automated detection of HT using ECG, HRV, PPG and BCG signals. In this review, we have identified 23 studies out of 250 screened papers, which fulfilled our eligibility criteria. Details of the study methods, physiological signal studied, database used, various nonlinear techniques employed, feature extraction, and diagnostic performance parameters are discussed. The machine learning and deep learning based methods based on ECG and HRV signals have yielded the best performance and can be used for the development of computer-aided diagnosis of HT.

2021,Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice,10.1111/jep.13528,"Brault, N.; Saxena, M.",For a critical appraisal of artificial intelligence in healthcare: The problem of bias in mHealth,English,"Rationale, aims and objectives: Artificial intelligence and big data are more and more used in medicine, either in prevention, diagnosis or treatment, and are clearly modifying the way medicine is thought and practiced. Some authors argue that the use of artificial intelligence techniques to analyze big data would even constitute a scientific revolution, in medicine as much as in other scientific disciplines. Moreover, artificial intelligence techniques, coupled with mobile health technologies, could furnish a personalized medicine, adapted to the individuality of each patient. In this paper we argue that this conception is largely a myth: what health professionals and patients need is not more data, but data that are critically appraised, especially to avoid bias. Methods: In this historical and conceptual article, we focus on two main problems: first, the data and the problem of its validity; second, the inference drawn from the data by AI, and the establishment of correlations through the use of algorithms. We use examples from the contemporary use of mobile health (mHealth), i.e. the practice of medicine and public health supported by mobile or wearable devices such as mobile phones or smart watches. Results: We show that the validity of the data and of the inferences drawn from these mHealth data are likely to be biased. As biases are insensitive to the size of the sample, even if the sample is the whole population, artificial intelligence and big data cannot avoid biases and even tend to increase them. Conclusions: The large amount of data thus appears rather as a problem than a solution. What contemporary medicine needs is not more data or more algorithms, but a critical appraisal of the data and of the analysis of the data. Considering the history of epidemiology, we propose three research priorities concerning the use of artificial intelligence and big data in medicine."

The majority of complications are infection and bowel-related. Modern wearable devices and Bluetooth-enabled devices can measure and transmit data directly to a mobile phone, which can then upload this data to a web server in real-time for remote monitoring. In this study, we test the feasibility of remote monitoring for 30 days in patients discharged from hospital following RC. Materials & Methods: As part of the DREAMPath (ISRCTN62293620) study, patients were provided with an iPhone, Apple Watch Series 4 and three Bluetooth peripherals (sphygmomanometer, pulse oximeter, thermometer). They were instructed to wear the Apple Watch at all times, and measure their observations twice a day. Additionally, patients were asked to complete a quality of recovery 15 questionnaire daily. At the end of 30 days, re-admission data was collected. Machine learning algorithms were applied to this data to test their value in predicting hospital admission. Results: 30 patients have been recruited into the study so far. At the time of our interim analysis, 5,687 data points were collected per patient during the month of monitoring. Four patients were re-admitted due to pulmonary embolism (1), infection (2) and stent problems (1) respectively. Physiological measures alone were able to predict re-admission > 48 hours prior to patient-initiated visit to hospital accident and emergency department. No false positives or false negatives were identifed using pre-determined cutoffs. Data from the wearable devices alone were able to detect all readmission events using machine learning algorithms. Conclusions: Remote monitoring is feasible, and patients can engage with it with minimal effort all while generating large amount of data that is relevant to their recovery. In this small study, we show that it is possible to detect physiological disturbances before patients feel unwell enough to be admitted to hospital. It would be informative to design an intervention to triage these patients earlier in an effort to reduce total re-admission days."

Methods: The watch measures single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), tri-axial seismocardiogram (SCG), and multi-wavelength photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals to compute the pulse transit time (PTT), allowing for BP estimation. We sent our custom watch device and an oscillometric BP cuff home with 21 healthy subjects, and captured the natural variability in BP over the course of a 24-hour period. Results: After calibration, our Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.69 and root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of 2.72 mmHg suggest that noninvasive PTT measurements correlate with around-the-clock BP. Using a novel two-point calibration method, we achieved a RMSE of 3.86 mmHg. We further demonstrated the potential of a semi-globalized adaptive model to reduce calibration requirements. Conclusion: This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first time that BP has been comprehensively estimated noninvasively using PTT in an at-home setting. We showed a more convenient method for obtaining ambulatory BP than through the use of the standard oscillometric cuff. We presented new calibration methods for BP estimation using fewer calibration points that are more practical for a real-world scenario. Significance: A custom watch (SeismoWatch) capable of taking multiple BP measurements enables reliable remote monitoring of daily BP and paves the way towards convenient hypertension screening and management, which can potentially reduce hospitalizations and improve quality of life."

Furthermore, the widespread use of remote monitoring medical devices, under the umbrella of the ""Internet of Medical Things"" (IoMT), has simplified the retrieval of patient information as they allow continuous monitoring and direct access to data by healthcare providers. However, due to possible issues in real-world settings, such as loss of connectivity, irregular use, misuse, or poor adherence to a monitoring program, the data collected might not be sufficient to implement accurate algorithms. For this reason, data augmentation techniques can be used to create synthetic datasets sufficiently large to train machine learning models.

However, current solutions use devices attached to the waist or wrist, causing discomfort in the people who wear them. The users also tend to forget to wear the devices carried in these positions. Therefore, in order to prevent these problems, the main objective of this work is designing and recollecting a new dataset about falls, falling risks and activities of daily living using an ankle-placed device obtaining a good balance between the different activity types. This dataset will be a useful tool for researchers who want to integrate the fall detector in the footwear. Thus, in this work we design the fall-detection device, study the suitable activities to be collected, collect the dataset from 21 users performing the studied activities and evaluate the quality of the collected dataset. As an additional and secondary study, we implement a simple Deep Learning classifier based on this data to prove the system's feasibility."

This rGO/AgNW-decorated fabric can be used to monitor external stimuli such as strain and temperature. In addition, it is used as a heater and as a supercapacitor and features an antibacterial hydrophobic surface that minimizes potential infection from external airborne viruses or virus-containing droplets.

Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the utility of wearable telemonitoring technologies to predict treatment outcomes using patient activity metrics and machine learning. Methods: In this prospective, single-center, single-cohort study, patients scheduled for pancreatectomy were provided with a wearable telemonitoring device to be worn prior to surgery. Patient clinical data were collected and all patients were evaluated using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program surgical risk calculator (ACS-NSQIP SRC). Machine learning models were developed to predict whether patients would have a textbook outcome and compared with the ACS-NSQIP SRC using area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves. Results: Between February 2019 and February 2020, 48 patients completed the study. Patient activity metrics were collected over an average of 27.8 days before surgery. Patients took an average of 4162.1 (SD 4052.6) steps per day and had an average heart rate of 75.6 (SD 14.8) beats per minute. Twenty-eight (58%) patients had a textbook outcome after pancreatectomy. The group of 20 (42%) patients who did not have a textbook outcome included 14 patients with severe complications and 11 patients requiring readmission. The ACS-NSQIP SRC had an AUROC curve of 0.6333 to predict failure to achieve a textbook outcome, while our model combining patient clinical characteristics and patient activity data achieved the highest performance with an AUROC curve of 0.7875. Conclusions: Machine learning models outperformed ACS-NSQIP SRC estimates in predicting textbook outcomes after pancreatectomy.

This gum sensor can be shaped arbitrarily, and the preparation process is green, pollution-free, with low energy consumption, and repeatable. Herein, this gum sensor can be utilized for real-time human healthcare monitoring effectively (i.e., facial mood changes, finger flexion, long time walking, and continuous ankle movement) and shows a fast response time of 297 ms and a reliable cycling performance in monitoring body motions. Furthermore, the gum sensor (containing edible salt) can act as a signal transmitter for intelligent information encryption and transmission in the light of the international Morse code with excellent repeatability and stability. Hence, this work will greatly possess wide potential application prospects in wearable electronics and information encryption.

Methods: Utilizing PRISMA guidelines, a literature search was conducted using the search terms “asthma” and “artificial intelligence.” PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, Embase, and Cochrane were utilized in this scoping review. Inclusion criteria consisted of articles published after 2015, written in English, and excluded review papers and abstracts. Results: The search criteria resulted in a total of 390 articles. A preliminary review was conducted based on inclusion criteria, thereby resulting in 55 articles. Relevant articles were subcategorized based on diagnosis (23.6%), endotypes (32.7%), triage/risk assessment (14.5%), Natural Language Processing (NLP)/big data (12.7%), and wearables/telemonitoring (16.5%).

Conclusions: Existing literature on machine learning and asthma often fails to thoroughly characterize the participants in their training populations. Specifically, patients within our network at Montefiore face unique environmental and socioeconomic challenges that are not reflected in the literature. This indicates a need to address the socioeconomic and environmental disparities in big data practices for characterizing asthma and its related triggers."

In this article, we propose a framework that relies on machine learning to efficiently recognise the user activity, useful for personal healthcare monitoring, while limiting the risk of users re-identification from biometric patterns characterizing each individual. To achieve that, we show that features in temporal domain are useful to discriminate user activity while features in frequency domain lead to distinguish the user identity. We then design a novel protection mechanism processing the raw signal on the user's smartphone to select relevant features for activity recognition and normalise features sensitive to re-identification. These unlinkable features are then transferred to the application server. We extensively evaluate our framework with reference datasets: Results show an accurate activity recognition (87%) while limiting the re-identification rate (33%). This represents a slight decrease of utility (9%) against a large privacy improvement (53%) compared to state-of-the-art baselines."

We develop from first principles an approximation to their behavior using Gaussian process regression and demonstrate the utility of the technique for estimating the excitation time-series of leg muscles during normal walking for nine healthy subjects. Specifically, excitations for six muscles were estimated using surface electromyography (sEMG) data during a finite time interval (called the input window) from four different muscles (called the input muscles) with mean absolute error (MAE) less than 5.0% of the maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) and that accounts for 82-88% of the variance (VAF) in the true excitations. Further, these estimated excitations informed muscle activations with less than 4.0% MAE and 89-93% VAF. We also present a detailed analysis of a number of different modeling choices, including every possible combination of four-, three- and two-muscle input sets, the size and structure of the input window, and the stationarity of the Gaussian process covariance functions.

Although neurological deficits require fast initiation of treatment in a restricted time, it is difficult for nonspecialists to detect and objectively assess the symptoms. In the clinical environment, diagnoses and decisions are based on clinical grading methods, including the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score or the Medical Research Council (MRC) score, which have been used to measure motor weakness. Objective grading in various environments is necessitated for consistent agreement among patients, caregivers, paramedics, and medical staff to facilitate rapid diagnoses and dispatches to appropriate medical centers. Objective: In this study, we aimed to develop an autonomous grading system for stroke patients. We investigated the feasibility of our new system to assess motor weakness and grade NIHSS and MRC scores of 4 limbs, similar to the clinical examinations performed by medical staff. Methods: We implemented an automatic grading system composed of a measuring unit with wearable sensors and a grading unit with optimized machine learning. Inertial sensors were attached to measure subtle weaknesses caused by paralysis of upper and lower limbs. We collected 60 instances of data with kinematic features of motor disorders from neurological examination and demographic information of stroke patients with NIHSS 0 or 1 and MRC 7, 8, or 9 grades in a stroke unit. Training data with 240 instances were generated using a synthetic minority oversampling technique to complement the imbalanced number of data between classes and low number of training data. We trained 2 representative machine learning algorithms, an ensemble and a support vector machine (SVM), to implement auto-NIHSS and auto-MRC grading. The optimized algorithms performed a 5-fold cross-validation and were searched by Bayes optimization in 30 trials. The trained model was tested with the 60 original hold-out instances for performance evaluation in accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC). Results: The proposed system can grade NIHSS scores with an accuracy of 83.3% and an AUC of 0.912 using an optimized ensemble algorithm, and it can grade with an accuracy of 80.0% and an AUC of 0.860 using an optimized SVM algorithm. The auto-MRC grading achieved an accuracy of 76.7% and a mean AUC of 0.870 in SVM classification and an accuracy of 78.3% and a mean AUC of 0.877 in ensemble classification. Conclusions: The automatic grading system quantifies proximal weakness in real time and assesses symptoms through automatic grading. The pilot outcomes demonstrated the feasibility of remote monitoring of motor weakness caused by stroke. The system can facilitate consistent grading with instant assessment and expedite dispatches to appropriate hospitals and treatment initiation by sharing auto-MRC and auto-NIHSS scores between prehospital and hospital responses as an objective observation."

The objective of this work was to define a Quality of Movement (QoM) index, inferred from inertial data related to turns, and strictly correlated with the patient's motor conditions, postural stability, and stage of the disease. Such a concise representation finds its main application in the remote monitoring of patients during daily activities at home.

In the proposed platform, the sensors utilize a state-of-the-art power saving technique known as Compressive Sensing (CS). CS allows sensors to retrieve the sensed data using fewer measurements by sending a compressed signal. In this framework, the signal reconstruction and processing are computed locally on a Heterogeneous Multicore Platform (HMP) device to decrease the dependency on the cloud. In addition, a framework has been implemented to control the system, set different parameters, display the data as well as send live notifications to medical experts through the cloud in order to alert them of any eventual hazardous event or abnormality and allow quick interventions. Finally, a case study of the system is presented demonstrating the acquisition and monitoring of the data for a given subject in real-time. The obtained results reveal that the proposed solution reduces 15.4% of energy consumption in sensors, that makes this prototype a good candidate for IoT employment in healthcare."

Regarding self-monitoring, wearable activity trackers allow automated passive data collection that educate and motivate patients. Wearing an activity tracker can improve walking time by around 1500 steps per day. However, there are concerns about measurement accuracy (e.g., lack of a common validation protocol or measurement discrepancies between different devices). For external monitoring, many innovative electronic tools are currently used in rheumatology to help support physician time management, to reduce the burden on clinic time, and to prioritize patients who may need further attention. In inflammatory arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis, regular monitoring of patients to detect disease flares improves outcomes. In a pilot study applying machine learning to activity tracker steps, we showed that physical activity was strongly linked to disease flares and that patterns of physical activity could be used to predict flares with great accuracy, with a sensitivity and specificity above 95%. Thus, automatic monitoring of steps may lead to improved disease control through potential early identification of disease flares. However, activity trackers have some limitations when applied to rheumatic patients, such as tracker adherence, lack of clarity on long-term effectiveness, or the potential multiplicity of trackers."

Recent Findings: Most wearables are marketed to consumers and can measure movement, heart rate, and blood pressure; detect and monitor arrhythmia; and support exercise training and rehabilitation. Wearable devices targeted at healthcare professionals include ECG patch recorders and vests, patches, and textiles with in-built sensors for improved prognostication and the early detection of acute decompensation. Integrating data from wearables into clinical decision-making has been slow due to clinical inertia and concerns regarding data security and validity, lack of evidence of meaningful impact, interoperability, regulatory and reimbursement issues, and legal liability. Summary: Although few studies have assessed how best to integrate wearable technologies into clinical practice, their use is rapidly expanding and may support improved decision-making by patients and healthcare professionals along the whole patient pathway."

As there is no effective therapy or vaccine yet, rigorous implementation of traditional public health measures such as isolation and quarantine remains the most effective tool to control the outbreak. When an asymptomatic individual with COVID-19 exposure is being quarantined, it is necessary to perform temperature and symptom surveillance. As such surveillance is intermittent in nature and highly dependent on self-discipline, it has limited effectiveness. Advances in biosensor technologies made it possible to continuously monitor physiological parameters using wearable biosensors with a variety of form factors. Objective To explore the potential of using wearable biosensors to continuously monitor multidimensional physiological parameters for early detection of COVID-19 clinical progression. Method This randomised controlled open-labelled trial will involve 200-1000 asymptomatic subjects with close COVID-19 contact under mandatory quarantine at designated facilities in Hong Kong. Subjects will be randomised to receive a remote monitoring strategy (intervention group) or standard strategy (control group) in a 1:1 ratio during the 14 day-quarantine period. In addition to fever and symptom surveillance in the control group, subjects in the intervention group will wear wearable biosensors on their arms to continuously monitor skin temperature, respiratory rate, blood pressure, pulse rate, blood oxygen saturation and daily activities. These physiological parameters will be transferred in real time to a smartphone application called Biovitals Sentinel. These data will then be processed using a cloud-based multivariate physiology analytics engine called Biovitals to detect subtle physiological changes. The results will be displayed on a web-based dashboard for clinicians' review. The primary outcome is the time to diagnosis of COVID-19. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been obtained from institutional review boards at the study sites. Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals."

This systematic review aims to investigate the comparative effectiveness, safety, and cost for virtual or remote clinic interventions for patients with CIEDs and explores how outcomes may be influenced by patient or system factors in-depth. Methods: We will perform a systematic literature search in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Proquest Dissertations & Theses, other EBM Reviews, and trial registry databases. Two authors will independently screen titles and abstracts for eligibility. We will include randomized and non-randomized controlled trials, quasi-randomized and experimental studies, cohort, and case-control studies. Study populations of interest are individuals with a CIED (pacemaker, ICD, CRT). Eligibility will be restricted to virtual or remote follow-up or care interventions compared to any other approach. The co-primary outcomes of interest are mortality and patient satisfaction. Secondary outcomes include clinical effectiveness (e.g., ICD shock, time-to-detection of medical event, hospitalizations), safety (e.g., serious or device-related adverse events), device efficacy (e.g., transmissions, malfunctions), costs, workflow (e.g., resources, process outcomes, time-saved), and patient reported (e.g., burden, quality of life). Data will be extracted by one author and checked by a second using a standardized template. We will use published frameworks to capture data relevant to intervention effects that may be influenced by intervention definition or complexity, context and setting, or in socially disadvantaged populations. Detailed descriptive results will be presented for all included studies and outcomes, and where feasible, synthesized using meta-analysis. Risk of bias will be assessed by two review authors independently using Cochrane Risk of Bias tools. Certainty of evidence will be assessed using the GRADE approach. Discussion: Increases in number of CIEDs implanted, combined with an aging population and finite health resource allocations at the system-level may lead to increased reliance on virtual follow-up or care models in the future. These models must prioritize consistent, equitable, and timely care as a priority. Results from this systematic review will provide important insight into the potential contextual factors which moderate or mediate the effectiveness, safety, and cost of virtual follow-up or care models for patients.

This makes remote monitoring and ambulatory cardiac rehabilitation (CR) therapy challenging. Current wearable multimodal devices enable remote monitoring. Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) can help in tackling multifaceted datasets. However, for clinical acceptance, easy interpretability of the AI models is crucial. The goal of the present study was to investigate whether a multi-parameter sensor could be used during a standardized activity test to interpret functional capacity in the longitudinal follow-up of CR patients. A total of 129 patients were followed for 3 months during CR using 6-min walking tests (6MWT) equipped with a wearable ECG and accelerometer device. Functional capacity was assessed based on 6MWT distance (6MWD). Linear and nonlinear interpretable models were explored to predict 6MWD. The t-distributed stochastic neighboring embedding (t-SNE) technique was exploited to embed and visualize high dimensional data. The performance of support vector machine (SVM) models, combining different features and using different kernel types, to predict functional capacity was evaluated. The SVM model, using chronotropic response and effort as input features, showed a mean absolute error of 42.8 m (±36.8 m). The 3D-maps derived using the t-SNE technique visualized the relationship between sensor-derived biomarkers and functional capacity, which enables tracking of the evolution of patients throughout the CR program. The current study showed that wearable monitoring combined with interpretable ML can objectively track clinical progression in a CR population. These results pave the road towards ambulatory CR."

However, such techniques are not always effectively implemented or timely available in the routine clinical practice. In recent years, the widespread availability of e-health solutions has stimulated the development of blood pressure telemonitoring (BPT) systems, which allow remote BP tracking and tighter and more efficient monitoring of patients’ health status. Recent Findings: There is currently strong evidence that BPT may be of benefit for hypertension screening and diagnosis and for improving hypertension management. The advantage is more significant when BPT is coupled with multimodal interventions involving a physician, a nurse or pharmacist, and including education on lifestyle and risk factors and drug management. Several randomized controlled studies documented enhanced hypertension management and improved BP control of hypertensive patients through BPT. Potential additional effects of BPT are represented by improved compliance to treatment, intensification, and optimization of drug use, improved quality of life, reduction in risk of developing cardiovascular complications, and cost-saving. Applications based on m-health and making use of wearables or smartwatches integrated with machine learning models are particularly promising for the future development of efficient BPT solutions, and they will provide remarkable support decision tools for doctors. Summary: BPT and telehealth will soon disrupt hypertension management. However, which approach will be the most effective and whether it will be sustainable in the long-term still need to be elucidated."

One of the key components of an ICU is the continuous monitoring of patients' vital parameters. However, existing advances in informatics, signal processing, or engineering that could alleviate the burden on ICUs have not yet been applied. This could be due to the lack of user involvement in research and development. Objective: This study focused on the satisfaction of ICU staff with current patient monitoring and their suggestions for future improvements. We aimed to identify aspects of monitoring that interrupt patient care, display devices for remote monitoring, use cases for artificial intelligence (AI), and whether ICU staff members are willing to improve their digital literacy or contribute to the improvement of patient monitoring. We further aimed to identify differences in the responses of different professional groups. Methods: This survey study was performed with ICU staff from 4 ICUs of a German university hospital between November 2019 and January 2020. We developed a web-based 36-item survey questionnaire, by analyzing a preceding qualitative interview study with ICU staff, about the clinical requirements of future patient monitoring. Statistical analyses of questionnaire results included median values with their bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals, and chi-square tests to compare the distributions of item responses of the professional groups. Results: In total, 86 of the 270 ICU physicians and nurses completed the survey questionnaire. The majority stated they felt confident using the patient monitoring equipment, but that high rates of false-positive alarms and the many sensor cables interrupted patient care. Regarding future improvements, respondents asked for wireless sensors, a reduction in the number of false-positive alarms, and hospital standard operating procedures for alarm management. Responses to the display devices proposed for remote patient monitoring were divided. Most respondents indicated it would be useful for earlier alerting or when they were responsible for multiple wards. AI for ICUs would be useful for early detection of complications and an increased risk of mortality; in addition, the AI could propose guidelines for therapy and diagnostics. Transparency, interoperability, usability, and staff training were essential to promote the use of AI. The majority wanted to learn more about new technologies for the ICU and required more time for learning. Physicians had fewer reservations than nurses about AI-based intelligent alarm management and using mobile phones for remote monitoring. Conclusions: This survey study of ICU staff revealed key improvements for patient monitoring in intensive care medicine. Hospital providers and medical device manufacturers should focus on reducing false alarms, implementing hospital alarm standard operating procedures, introducing wireless sensors, preparing for the use of AI, and enhancing the digital literacy of ICU staff. Our results may contribute to the user-centered transfer of digital technologies into practice to alleviate challenges in intensive care medicine."

Bespoke subject-specific treatment (medication or deep brain stimulation (DBS)) is critical for management, yet depends on precise assessment cardinal PD symptoms - bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor. Clinician diagnosis is the basis of treatment, yet it allows only a cross-sectional assessment of symptoms which can vary on an hourly basis and is liable to inter- and intra-rater subjectivity across human examiners. Automated symptomatic assessment has attracted significant interest to optimise treatment regimens between clinician visits, however, no wearable has the capacity to simultaneously assess all three cardinal symptoms. Challenges in the measurement of rigidity, mapping muscle activity out-of-clinic and sensor fusion have inhibited translation. In this study, we address all through a novel wearable sensor system and machine learning algorithms. The sensor system is composed of a force-sensor, three inertial measurement units (IMUs) and four custom mechanomyography (MMG) sensors. The system was tested in its capacity to predict Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores based on quantitative assessment of bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor in PD patients. 23 PD patients were tested with the sensor system in parallel with exams conducted by treating clinicians and 10 healthy subjects were recruited as a comparison control group. Results prove the system accurately predicts UPDRS scores for all symptoms (85.4% match on average with physician assessment) and discriminates between healthy subjects and PD patients (96.6% on average). MMG features can also be used for remote monitoring of severity and fluctuations in PD symptoms out-of-clinic. This closed-loop feedback system enables individually tailored and regularly updated treatment, facilitating better outcomes for a very large patient population."

Since then, the development of artificial intelligence has in part been shaped by the field of neuroscience. By understanding the human brain, scientists have attempted to build new intelligent machines capable of performing complex tasks akin to humans. Indeed, future research into artificial intelligence will continue to benefit from the study of the human brain. While the development of artificial intelligence algorithms has been fast paced, the actual use of most artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in biomedical engineering and clinical practice is still markedly below its conceivably broader potentials. This is partly because for any algorithm to be incorporated into existing workflows it has to stand the test of scientific validation, clinical and personal utility, application context, and is equitable as well. In this context, there is much to be gained by combining AI and human intelligence (HI). Harnessing Big Data, computing power and storage capacities, and addressing societal issues emergent from algorithm applications, demand deploying HI in tandem with AI. Very few countries, even economically developed states, lack adequate and critical governance frames to best understand and steer the AI innovation trajectories in health care. Drug discovery and translational pharmaceutical research stand to gain from AI technology provided they are also informed by HI. In this expert review, we analyze the ways in which AI applications are likely to traverse the continuum of life from birth to death, and encompassing not only humans but also all animal, plant, and other living organisms that are increasingly touched by AI. Examples of AI applications include digital health, diagnosis of diseases in newborns, remote monitoring of health by smart devices, real-time Big Data analytics for prompt diagnosis of heart attacks, and facial analysis software with consequences on civil liberties. While we underscore the need for integration of AI and HI, we note that AI technology does not have to replace medical specialists or scientists and rather, is in need of such expert HI. Altogether, AI and HI offer synergy for responsible innovation and veritable prospects for improving health care from prevention to diagnosis to therapeutics while unintended consequences of automation emergent from AI and algorithms should be borne in mind on scientific cultures, work force, and society at large."

Also, enabled by technological advancements and electronics miniaturization, wearable health device (WHD) applications are expected to grow exponentially. This, in turn, may make 4P medicine (predictive, precise, preventive and personalized) a more attainable goal within dialysis patient care. This article discusses different use cases where WHD could be of relevance for dialysis patient care, i.e. measurement of heart rate, arrhythmia detection, blood pressure, hyperkalaemia, fluid overload and physical activity. After adequate validation of the different WHD in this specific population, data obtained from WHD could form part of a body area network (BAN), which could serve different purposes such as feedback on actionable parameters like physical inactivity, fluid overload, danger signalling or event prediction. For a BAN to become clinical reality, not only must technical issues, cybersecurity and data privacy be addressed, but also adequate models based on artificial intelligence and mathematical analysis need to be developed for signal optimization, data representation, data reliability labelling and interpretation. Moreover, the potential of WHD and BAN can only be fulfilled if they are part of a transformative healthcare system with a shared responsibility between patients, healthcare providers and the payors, using a step-up approach that may include digital assistants and dedicated 'digital clinics'. The coming decade will be critical in observing how these developments will impact and transform dialysis patient care and will undoubtedly ask for an increased 'digital literacy' for all those implicated in their care."

Methods: The LINK-HF study (Multisensor Non-invasive Remote Monitoring for Prediction of Heart Failure Exacerbation) examined the performance of a personalized analytical platform using continuous data streams to predict rehospitalization after HF admission. Study subjects were monitored for up to 3 months using a disposable multisensor patch placed on the chest that recorded physiological data. Data were uploaded continuously via smartphone to a cloud analytics platform. Machine learning was used to design a prognostic algorithm to detect HF exacerbation. Clinical events were formally adjudicated. Results: One hundred subjects aged 68.4±10.2 years (98% male) were enrolled. After discharge, the analytical platform derived a personalized baseline model of expected physiological values. Differences between baseline model estimated vital signs and actual monitored values were used to trigger a clinical alert. There were 35 unplanned nontrauma hospitalization events, including 24 worsening HF events.

However, the large-scale preparation of low-cost, high-sensitivity piezoresistive sensors still face huge challenges. Inspired by the specific structures and excellent metal conductivity of a family of two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal carbides and nitrides (MXene) and the high-performance sensing effect of human skin including randomly distributed microstructural receptors, we fabricate a highly sensitive MXene-based piezoresistive sensor with bioinspired microspinous microstructures formed by a simple abrasive paper stencil printing process. The obtained piezoresistive sensor shows high sensitivity (151.4 kPa-1), relatively short response time (<130 ms), subtle pressure detection limit of 4.4 Pa, and excellent cycle stability over 10,000 cycles. The mechanism of the high sensitivity of the sensor is dynamically revealed from the structural perspective by means of in situ electron microscopy experiment and finite element simulation. Bioinspired microspinous microstructures can effectively improve the sensitivity of the pressure sensor and the limit of the detectable subtle pressure.

In this paper, we introduce a transfer-learning based Long-term Recurrent Convolution Network (LRCN) named as 'MyoNet' for the classification of lower limb movements, along with the prediction of the corresponding knee joint angle. The model consists of three blocks- (i) feature extractor block, (ii) joint angle prediction block, and (iii) movement classification block. Initially, the model is end-to-end trained for knee joint angle prediction followed by transferring the knowledge of a trained model to the movement classification through transfer-learning approach making a memory and computationally efficient design. The proposed MyoNet was evaluated on publicly available University of California (UC) Irvine machine learning repository dataset of the lower limb for 11 healthy subjects and 11 subjects with knee pathology for three movements type-walking, standing with knee flexion movements and sitting with knee extension movements. The average mean absolute error (MAE) resulted in the prediction of joint angle for healthy subjects and subjects with knee pathology are 8.1 % and 9.2 % respectively. Subsequently, an average classification accuracy of 98.1 % and 92.4 % were achieved for healthy subjects and subjects with knee pathology, respectively. Interestingly, the significance of this study in itself is promising with substantial improvement in the performance compared to state-of-the-art methodologies.

The manufacturers of these devices provide proprietary software that labels the sensor data at specified time intervals with activity and sleep information. If the device wearer has a health condition affecting their movement, such as a stroke, these labels and their values can vary greatly from manufacturer to manufacturer. Consequently, generating outcome predictions based on data collected from patients attending inpatient rehabilitation wearing different sensor devices can be challenging, which hampers usefulness of these data for patient care decisions. In this article, we present a data-driven approach to combining datasets collected from different device manufacturers. With the ability to combine datasets, we merge data from three different device manufacturers to form a larger dataset of time series data collected from 44 patients receiving inpatient therapy services. To gain insights into the recovery process, we use this dataset to build models that predict a patient's next day physical activity duration and next night sleep duration. Using our data-driven approach and the combined dataset, we obtained a normalized root mean square error prediction of 9.11% for daytime physical activity and 11.18% for nighttime sleep duration. Our sleep result is comparable to the accuracy we achieved using the manufacturer's sleep labels (12.26%). Our device-independent predictions are suitable for both point-of-care and remote monitoring applications to provide information to clinicians for customizing therapy services and potentially decreasing recovery time."

While a multitude of commercial wearables can detect activities of daily life, such as walking and running, they cannot accurately detect physical-therapy exercises. The goal of this study was to build open-source classifiers for remote physical-therapy monitoring and provide insight on how data collection choices may impact classifier performance. Methods: We trained and evaluated multi-class classifiers using data from 19 healthy adults who performed 37 exercises while wearing 10 inertial measurement units (IMUs) on the chest, pelvis, wrists, thighs, shanks, and feet. We investigated the effect of sensor density, location, type, sampling frequency, output granularity, feature engineering, and training-data size on exercise-classification performance. Results: Exercise groups (n = 10) could be classified with 96% accuracy using a set of 10 IMUs and with 89% accuracy using a single pelvis-worn IMU. Multiple sensor modalities (i.e., accelerometers and gyroscopes), high sampling frequencies, and more data from the same population did not improve model performance, but in the future data from diverse populations and better feature engineering could. Conclusions: Given the growing demand for exercise monitoring systems, our sensitivity analyses, along with open-source tools and data, should reduce barriers for product developers, who are balancing accuracy with product formfactor, and increase transparency and trust in clinicians and patients."

Elderly gait is a sensitive marker for their health status which enables detection of physical and mental impairments. This study aimed to advance the performance of elderly gait event detection using a single waist-worn IMU sensor through deep learning models. Four deep learning models MLP, CNN, LSTM, and GRU were trained and tested on data from the community-dwelling elderly. The accuracy was measured for six detection delay tolerance ranges. The GRU model achieved the best accuracy of 99.47% at a detection delay tolerance range of ±6TS (±6ms) and 78.98% for a more precise range of ±1TS (±1ms). The proposed method showed significant improvement over previously reported event detection results by achieving an MAE of 8.9ms and 7.6ms for the HS and TO events respectively.

In RPM, the IoMT sense a patient’s biophysical data and transmits it in real time while the autonomous system processes the data for clinical notifications and storage. However, RPM deployments face two diverse challenges: how to present continuous data so that healthcare professionals can quickly interpret data streams and how to manage a great deal of missing data that occurs in RPM. Several studies suggested techniques for imputing missing data in static databases, which are unsuitable for RPM. A method for constantly streaming healthcare data to medical experts involves summarizing vital signs information into a numerical score, such as the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS), which may be visually displayed to highlight MEWS patterns over a certain period. However, a MEWS chart is simplistic and more sophisticated ways to present data visually for straightforward interpretation are needed. This research proposes a solution for the visualization and missing data challenges by identifying patterns in the RPM data. First, a pattern-matching technique is proposed to address the missing data by considering the correlation and variability of the vital signs, resulting in a comparable correct match rate. Second, we transform the observed raw physiological vital signs data into concepts we call trust, frequency, trend, and slope parameters for visualization and automated alerts. The proposed approach can better support clinical decision-making than the MEWS. Comprehensive visualization approaches and missing data solutions can improve the quality and dependability of patient risk assessments."

Identifying the impact of levodopa on real-world motor state (e.g. ON/OFF/ DYSKINESIA) is important for both clinicians and people with PD. The aim of the present work was to automatically classify medication states using machine learning models. Continuous 7-day data were collected in 26 people with PD using an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) placed on the fifth lumbar vertebrae (L5) level. Over the week, each participant was asked to complete a diary by annotating medication states (off-condition and dyskinesias) with a 30-minute resolution. Diary entries were used as reference labels assigned to the processed IMU data. Two different networks were chosen for the classification: the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm (kNN) to identify ON-OFF-DYSKINESIA classes and Fine Tree (FT) to identify only OFF and ON classes. Preliminary results demonstrate that IMU data paired with machine learning could accurately classify ON-OFF and DYSKINESIA with 84% accuracy and the ON-OFF states were classified with 95% accuracy. These results are encouraging and pave the way to a better understanding of the effect that medication has on motor symptoms in PD during everyday life and may serve as a useful tool for optimizing clinical management of people with PD."

Such cuffless, non-invasive, and continuous solution is suitable for remote and ambulatory monitoring. A machine learning model based on PPG signal can be used to detect hypertension, estimate beat-by-beat ABP values, and even reconstruct the shape of the ABP. Overall, models presented in literature have shown good performance, but there is a gap between research and potential real-world use cases. Usually, models are trained and tested on data from the same dataset and same subjects, which may lead to overestimating their accuracy. In this paper: we compare cross-validation, where the test data are from the same dataset as training data, and external validation, where the model is tested on samples from a new dataset, on a regression model which predicts diastolic blood pressure from PPG features. The results show that, in the cross-validation, the predicted and the real values are linearly dependent, while in the external validation, the predicted values are not related to the real ones, but probably just through an average value."

Annually, it is estimated that coronary heart disease (CHD) kills approximately 382,820 people in the world. According to statistics, in the year 2022 around 200 million people are living with coronary heart disease thus, prevention and detection of CVD are important. According to surveys, India will have more cardiac patients than any other nation by the year 2023. Thus, electrocardiograms, which are used to monitor the electrical activity of the heart, are more of a need than a pleasure. Remote vital sign monitoring systems have become a promising solution to detect and prevent heart attacks. This study proposes a health monitoring system that utilizes wearable devices to collect and analyze data on the vital signs of heart attack patients continuously. The system also incorporates machine-learning algorithms to analyze the data, identify patterns and anomalies, and generate real-time alerts for healthcare professionals in case of any abnormalities. The proposed system can be a valuable tool in preventing and detecting heart attacks and has the potential to revolutionize how healthcare professionals monitor and treat heart attack patients."

Unattended stress is a silent killer and may lead to fatal physical and mental disorders if left unidentified. Stress identification based on individual judgement often leads to under-diagnosis and delayed treatment possibilities. EEG-based stress monitoring is quite popular in this context, but impractical to use for continuous remote monitoring.Continuous remote monitoring of stress using signals acquired from everyday wearables like smart watches is the best alternative here. Non-EEG data such as heart rate and ectodermal activity can also act as indicators of physiological stress. In this work, we have explored the possibility of using nonlinear features from non-EEG data such as (a) heart rate, (b) ectodermal activity, (c) body temperature (d) SpO2 and (e) acceleration in detecting four different types of neurological states; namely (1) Relaxed state, (2) State of Physical stress, (3) State of Cognitive stress and (4) State of Emotional stress. Physiological data of 20 healthy adults have been used from the noneeg database of PhysioNet.Results: We used two machine learning models; a linear logistic regression and a nonlinear random forest to detect (a) stress from relaxed state and (4) the four different neurological states. We trained the models using linear and nonlinear features separately. For the 2-class and 4-class problems, using nonlinear features increased the accuracy of the models. Moreover, it is also proved in this study that by using nonlinear features, we can avoid the use of complex machine learning models."

The manufacturers of these devices provide proprietary software that labels the sensor data at specified time intervals with activity and sleep information. If the device wearer has a health condition affecting their movement, such as a stroke, these labels and their values can vary greatly from manufacturer to manufacturer. Consequently, generating outcome predictions based on data collected from patients attending inpatient rehabilitation wearing different sensor devices can be challenging, which hampers usefulness of these data for patient care decisions. In this article, we present a data-driven approach to combining datasets collected from different device manufacturers. With the ability to combine datasets, we merge data from three different device manufacturers to form a larger dataset of time series data collected from 44 patients receiving inpatient therapy services. To gain insights into the recovery process, we use this dataset to build models that predict a patient's next day physical activity duration and next night sleep duration. Using our data-driven approach and the combined dataset, we obtained a normalized root mean square error prediction of 9.11% for daytime physical activity and 11.18% for nighttime sleep duration. Our sleep result is comparable to the accuracy we achieved using the manufacturer's sleep labels (12.26%).

Elderly individuals at home or in senior centers typically contact their physicians once a serious medical condition is obvious. There are very few systems with automated means of monitoring the health of individuals recovering from an injury or monitoring their progress when conducting telerehabilitation using wearables, remote cameras, and the cloud. To address these automation and long-term health monitoring issues, we have developed a multi-modal platform that employs common, low-cost wearables, and teleconferencing tools that takes advantage of cloud streaming services. One modality is based on Visual IoT and edge devices that automatically connect as teleconferencing clients to record human subjects’ telerehabilitation and teletreatment sessions and push these recordings to cloud storage. We performed experiments applying two different deep learning models to the cloud video streams to track whole-body skeleton motion or to detect hand keypoints during telerehabilitation. The rehabilitation maybe associated with recovery from a stroke or other similar incident. The other modality of our platform includes an Apple Watch ® App that pushes users’ physiological and kinematic data to the cloud and automatically generates data analytics dashboards for use by clinicians. Both, the wearables-based and the Visual IoT-based modalities complement each other in telerehabilitation or teletreatment controlled by clinicians.

The combination of technology and network with medical knowledge leads to important telemedicine solutions. Telemedicine is the practice of medical care where patient and providers are separated by distance. Telemonitoring of chronic diseases is one of the most important aspects of telemedicine.

The increasing need for these automated systems has led to the emergence of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) networks. In the IoMT networks, the biosensor devices collect vital signs and transmit them to the gateway for further analysis and fusion. In light of the limited biosensor device resources (power, storage, and computation) and the periodical transmission of a large amount of data, it is necessary to optimize the transmission of data in order to conserve power while maintaining data quality at the gateway. Also, it became important to have a decision-making-based machine learning model at the gateway to evaluate a patient’s health and make a quick, accurate decision in case of an emergency. This article proposes multibiosensor data sampling and transmission reduction with decision-making (MuDaSaTReD) for remote patient monitoring in the IoMT networks. The MuDaSaTReD achieves this goal on two levels: biosensors and a fog gateway. It uses an energy-saving lightweight data transmission (ELiDaT) algorithm to get rid of the repeated data and then adapts the sampling rate of each biosensor using an adaptive data sampling (ADaS) algorithm. The Multibiosensor Data Sampling and Transmission Reduction with Decision-making (MuDaFuDeC) implements the machine learning model at the fog gateway to learn and decide the situation of the patient according to the received data from the biosensors. The performance evaluation shows that the MuDaFuDeC outperforms other approaches in terms of the data reduction percentage and energy consumption. It keeps a good representation of all the scores at the fog gateway and makes automated, fast, and accurate decisions based on the patient’s condition."

Salama,Improved Coyote Optimization Algorithm and Deep Learning Driven Activity Recognition in Healthcare,,"Healthcare is an area of concern where the application of human-centred design practices and principles can enormously affect well-being and patient care. The provision of high-quality healthcare services requires a deep understanding of patients’ needs, experiences, and preferences. Human activity recognition (HAR) is paramount in healthcare monitoring by using machine learning (ML), sensor data, and artificial intelligence (AI) to track and discern individuals’ behaviours and physical movements. This technology allows healthcare professionals to remotely monitor patients, thereby ensuring they adhere to prescribed rehabilitation or exercise routines, and identify falls or anomalies, improving overall care and safety of the patient. HAR for healthcare monitoring, driven by deep learning (DL) algorithms, leverages neural networks and large quantities of sensor information to autonomously and accurately detect and track patients’ behaviors and physical activities. DL-based HAR provides a cutting-edge solution for healthcare professionals to provide precise and more proactive interventions, reducing the burden on healthcare systems and improving patient well-being while increasing the overall quality of care. Therefore, the study presents an improved coyote optimization algorithm with a deep learning-assisted HAR (ICOADL-HAR) approach for healthcare monitoring. The purpose of the ICOADL-HAR technique is to analyze the sensor information of the patients to determine the different kinds of activities. In the primary stage, the ICOADL-HAR model allows a data normalization process using the Z-score approach. For activity recognition, the ICOADL-HAR technique employs an attention-based long short-term memory (ALSTM) model. Finally, the hyperparameter tuning of the ALSTM model can be performed by using ICOA. The stimulation validation of the ICOADL-HAR model takes place using benchmark HAR datasets. The wide-ranging comparison analysis highlighted the improved recognition rate of the ICOADL-HAR method compared to other existing HAR approaches in terms of various measures."

It is remarkably intricate to diagnose HD with disparate symptoms or features. With the augmentation in popularity of smart wearable gadgets, a chance to render an Internet of Things (IoT) solution has turned out to be more. Unfortunately, the survival rates are low for the people suffering from sudden heart attacks. Consequently, a patient monitoring scheme intended for heart patients utilizing IoT centered Deep Learning Modified Neural Network (DLMNN) is proposed to assist in the HD diagnosis, and medication is given accordingly. This proposed technique is executed via `3' steps: I) Authentication, ii) Encryption, and iii) Classification. First, by utilizing the substitution cipher (SC) together with the SHA-512, the heart patient of the specific hospital is authenticated. Subsequently, the wearable IoT sensor device, which is fixed to the patient's body, concurrently transmits the sensor data to the cloud. This sensor data is encrypted and securely transmitted to the cloud utilizing the PDH-AES technique. After that, the encrypted data is finally decrypted, and by employing the DLMNN classifier, the classification is done. The classified outcomes comprise `2'types of data: i) normal and ii) abnormal. It denotes the patient's heart condition and if the outcome is abnormal, an alert text is passed to the physician for treating the patient. The investigational outcomes are estimated and the DLMNN for HD diagnosis shows improvement as compared to existing algorithms. Additionally, the proposed PDH-AES used in support of secure data transmission results in the highest level of security i.e. 95.87%, and it is achieved in the lowest time for encryption along with decryption when weighted against the existent AES."

In order to help these patients recover from FoG episodes, Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS) is needed. The authors propose a ubiquitous embedded system that detects FOG events with a Machine Learning (ML) subsystem from accelerometer signals. By making inferences on-device, we avoid issues prevalent in cloud-based systems such as latency and network connection dependency. The resource-efficient classifier used, reduces the model size requirements by approximately 400 times compared to the best performing standard ML systems, with a trade-off of a mere 1.3% in best classification accuracy. The aforementioned trade-off facilitates deployability in a wide range of embedded devices including microcontroller based systems. The research also explores the optimization procedure to deploy the model on an ATMega2560 microcontroller with a minimum system latency of 44.5 ms. The smallest model size of the proposed resource efficient ML model was 1.4 KB with an average recall score of 93.58%."

Coronary angiography, the principal diagnostic tool for CAD, is invasive, expensive, and requires a lot of skilled effort. The current study aims to develop an automated and non-invasive CAD detection model and improve its performance as closely as possible to clinically acceptable diagnostic sensitivity. Electrocardiogram (ECG) characteristics are observed to be altered due to CAD and can be studied to develop a screening tool for its detection. The subject’s clinical information can help broadly identify the high-cardiac-risk population and serve as a primary step in diagnosing CAD. This paper presents an approach to automatically detect CAD based on clinical data, morphological ECG features, and heart rate variability (HRV) features extracted from short-duration Lead-II ECG recordings. A few popular machine-learning classifiers, including support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), K-nearest neighbours (KNN), Gaussian Naïve Bayes (GNB), and multi-layer perceptron (MLP), are trained on the extracted feature space, and their performance is evaluated. Classifiers built by integrating clinical data and features extracted from ECG recordings demonstrated better performance than those built on each feature set separately, and the RF classifier outperforms other considered machine learners and reports an average testing accuracy of 94% and a G-mean score of 92% with a 5-fold cross-validation training accuracy of 95(± 0.04)%.Clinical relevance— The proposed method uses a brief, single-lead ECG recording and performs similarly to current clinical practices in an explainable manner. This makes it suitable for deployment via wearable technology (like smart watch gadgets) and telemonitoring, which may facilitate an earlier and more widespread CAD diagnosis."

Remote monitoring of elderly and disabled people living in smart homes is highly challenging due to probable accidents which might occur due to daily activities such as falls. For elderly people, fall is considered as a major reason for death of post-traumatic complication. So, early identification of elderly people falls in smart homes is needed to increase the survival rate of the person or offer required support. Recently, the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), IoT, wearables, smartphones, etc. makes it feasible to design fall detection systems for smart homecare. In this view, this paper presents an IoT enabled elderly fall detection model using optimal deep convolutional neural network (IMEFD-ODCNN) for smart homecare. The goal of the IMEFD-ODCNN model is to enable smartphones and intelligent deep learning (DL) algorithms to detect the occurrence of falls in the smart home. Primarily, the input video captured by the IoT devices is pre-processed in different ways like resizing, augmentation, and min-max based normalization. Besides, SqueezeNet model is employed as a feature extraction technique to derive appropriate feature vectors for fall detection. In addition, the hyperparameter tuning of the SqueezeNet model takes place using the salp swarm optimization (SSO) algorithm. Finally, sparrow search optimization algorithm (SSOA) with variational autoencoder (VAE), called SSOA-VAE based classifier is employed for the classification of fall and non-fall events. Finally, in case of fall event detected, the smartphone sends an alert to the caretakers and hospital management. The performance validation of the IMEFD-ODCNN model takes place on UR fall detection dataset and multiple cameras fall dataset. The experimental outcomes highlighted the promising performance of the IMEFD-ODCNN model over the recent methods with the maximum accuracy of 99.76% and 99.57% on the multiple cameras fall and UR fall detection dataset."

Machine learning techniques have been proposed as a potential solution, however, they are less interpretable and generalizable when compared to physics-based techniques. Herein, we propose a hybrid method utilizing inertial sensor- and electromyography (EMG)-driven simulation of muscle contraction to characterize knee joint and muscle mechanics during walking gait. Machine learning is used only to map a subset of measured muscle excitations to a full set thereby reducing the number of required sensors. We demonstrate the utility of the approach for estimating net knee flexion moment (KFM) as well as individual muscle moment and work during the stance phase of gait across nine unimpaired subjects. Across all subjects, KFM was estimated with 0.91%BW•H RMSE and strong correlations (r = 0.87) compared to ground truth inverse dynamics analysis. Estimates of individual muscle moments were strongly correlated (r = 0.81–0.99) with a reference EMG-driven technique using optical motion capture and a full set of electrodes as were estimates of muscle work (r = 0.88–0.99). Implementation of the proposed technique in the current work included instrumenting only three muscles with surface electrodes (lateral and medial gastrocnemius and vastus medialis) and both the thigh and shank segments with inertial sensors. These sensor locations permit instrumentation of a knee brace/sleeve facilitating a practically deployable mechanism for monitoring muscle and joint mechanics with performance comparable to the current state-of-the-art."

Radar serves as a non-contact healthcare device, continuously measuring human’s vital signs and behavior to provide daily and comprehensive long-term record on health status. However, radar sensor data collected from various users and families usually involve sensitive personal information, while traditional deep learning technologies using IoMT radar data may present high privacy leakage risks. This paper proposes FedRadar, a novel federated multi-task transfer learning framework for radar-based heartbeat rate and activity monitoring in IoMT to solve these challenges. It deals with the decentralized structure, training personalized multi-task models collaboratively, combining the shared relevance knowledge of human’s physiological information while keeping personal radar data locally for privacy protection. First, the multi-task neural network is built on the spatial-temporal radar data to capture the potential relationship and shared representations between human’s vital sign and activity. Furthermore, the federated learning with knowledge transfer scheme is designed to achieve personalized local models by transferring coarse relevant features and keeping fine-grained individual information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of FedRadar with 2.8% and 2.5% superior than local training model respectively on the accuracy of heartbeat rate estimation and activity classification in realistic constructed radar datasets. In addition, FedRadar is extensible and suitable to continuously monitor multiple health indicators with privacy protection in IoMT.

Federated learning (FL) is one of the solutions to user privacy and provides distributed training among several local devices. In addition, it reduces the computation and bandwidth of transferring videos to the central server in camera-based IoMT devices. In this work, we design an edge-based federated framework for such devices. In contrast to traditional methods that drop the resource-constrained stragglers in a federated round, our system provides a methodology to incorporate them. We propose a new phase in the FL algorithm, known as split learning. The stragglers train collaboratively with the nearest edge node using split learning. We test the implementation using heterogeneous computing devices that extract vital signs from videos. The results show a reduction of 3.6 h in the training time of videos using the split learning phase with respect to the traditional approach. We also evaluate the performance of the devices and system with key parameters, CPU utilization, memory consumption, and data rate. Furthermore, we achieve 87.29% and 60.26% test accuracy at the nonstragglers and stragglers, respectively, with a global accuracy of 90.32% at the server. Therefore, FedCare provides a straggler-resistant federated method for a heterogeneous system for social IoMT devices."

Yet, this wealth of data is lacking for emerging, less intrusive modalities, such as ear-EEG.Methods and procedures: The current study seeks to harness the abundance of open-source scalp EEG datasets by applying models pre-trained on data, either directly or with minimal fine-tuning; this is achieved in the context of effective sleep analysis from ear-EEG data that was recorded using a single in-ear electrode, referenced to the ipsilateral mastoid, and developed in-house as described in our previous work. Unlike previous studies, our research uniquely focuses on an older cohort (17 subjects aged 65-83, mean age 71.8 years, some with health conditions), and employs LightGBM for transfer learning, diverging from previous deep learning approaches. Results: Results show that the initial accuracy of the pre-trained model on ear-EEG was 70.1%, but fine-tuning the model with ear-EEG data improved its classification accuracy to 73.7%. The fine-tuned model exhibited a statistically significant improvement (p < 0.05, dependent t-test) for 10 out of the 13 participants, as reflected by an enhanced average Cohen’s kappa score (a statistical measure of inter-rater agreement for categorical items) of 0.639, indicating a stronger agreement between automated and expert classifications of sleep stages. Comparative SHAP value analysis revealed a shift in feature importance for the N3 sleep stage, underscoring the effectiveness of the fine-tuning process.Conclusion: Our findings underscore the potential of fine-tuning pre-trained scalp EEG models on ear-EEG data to enhance classification accuracy, particularly within an older population and using feature-based methods for transfer learning. This approach presents a promising avenue for ear-EEG analysis in sleep studies, offering new insights into the applicability of transfer learning across different populations and computational techniques.Clinical impact: An enhanced ear-EEG method could be pivotal in remote monitoring settings, allowing for continuous, non-invasive sleep quality assessment in elderly patients with conditions like dementia or sleep apnea."

In this study, the data from the EMS system were subjected to an IOMT analysis. The system, which was created to handle medical and trauma crises concurrently, covers the majority of the nation. Plans call for adding air medical services in addition to the current ground ambulance service as part of the country-wide expansion of the current ground ambulance service. The results of this study demonstrate that technology can assist in the remote monitoring of a variety of cardiovascular illnesses (CVDs), including diabetes, hypertension, and congestive heart failure (CHF), as well as the discomfort and stress brought on by these ailments. E-textile sensors that were sewed into garments were used to assist in electrocardiogram analysis (ECG). An electrocardiogram is a piece of paper that depicts the electrical activity of the heart (ECG). Both the depolarization that takes place during the atrial and ventricular cardiac muscles' contraction and the repolarization that takes place during their relaxation can be captured by an ECG. E-textile sensors that can be sewed into clothing are now the most innovative technology available to the healthcare industry. There are many different kinds of wearable E-textiles on the market right now. Among other things, these E-textiles may regulate temperature, emit light, and react to touch.

People use IoT devices for performing business transactions, daily tasks, and healthcare monitoring. IoT devices generate huge amounts of data assets that have potential applications. Biometrics is a potential application of sensors data. The traditional biometric methods such as PINs, passwords are exposed to numerous attacks such as replication, repeated passwords, etc. Sensors’ data-based continuous authentication methods are suitable for maintaining users’ privacy and security in mobile IoT systems. Most of the existing authentication methods have applied motion-based sensors for building users’ identification profiles. The proposed method uses motion sensors and biomedical sensors for reliable and multi-factor user authentication. In this article, we have introduced an IoT sensors data analytics framework to construct user authentication models. We apply the fiducial points-based feature extraction method data for extracting discriminative features. These features act as unique user profiles for authentication purposes. We have performed a detailed analysis of the proposed approach using the publically available datasets. The experiments elaborate on the effectiveness of IoTauth for improved authentication results."

Traditional methods of weighing premature infants often involve the removal and reinsertion of medical tubes, a process that can cause discomfort and potential health risks to these vulnerable patients. This abstract introduces an innovative weight monitoring system designed to provide real-time, accurate measurements of a premature infant’s weight in milligrams without the need to disturb the infant or remove medical tubing. Utilizing the NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontroller and a sensitive load cell, the system offers a non-intrusive, continuous weight monitoring solution. The design addresses the critical need for minimizing physical handling of premature infants while ensuring accurate weight tracking, a key indicator of health and development. The system’s capability to transmit real-time data to medical professionals’ aid in timely decision-making and enhances the overall care process. The design and implementation of the system, including the integration of the NodeMCU ESP8266 platform with the load cell for high-precision measurements, are detailed. Furthermore, the calibration process, data accuracy, and the system’s potential to reduce the workload of medical staff and improve the standard of care in NICUs are discussed.

Cobelli,Data-Driven Anomaly Recognition for Unsupervised Model-Free Fault Detection in Artificial Pancreas,,"The last decade has seen tremendous improvements in technologies for Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) management, in particular the so-called artificial pancreas (AP), a wearable closed-loop device modulating insulin injection based on glucose sensor readings. Unluckily, the AP actuator, an insulin pump, is subject to failures, with potentially serious consequences for subject safety. This calls for the development of advanced monitoring systems, leveraging the unprecedented data availability. This paper tackles for the first time the problem of automatically detecting pump faults with multidimensional data-driven anomaly detection (AD) methodologies. The approach allows to avoid the subtask of identifying a physiological model, typical of model-based approaches. Furthermore, we employ unsupervised methods, removing the need of labeled data for training, hardly available in practice. The adopted data-driven AD methods are local outlier factor, connectivity-based outlier factor, and isolation forest. Moreover, we propose a modification of these methods to cope with the dynamic nature of the underlying problem. The algorithms were tuned and tested on: 1) two-synthetic 100-patients' data set, of one-month data each, generated using the “UVA/Padova T1D Simulator,” a large-scale nonlinear computer simulator of T1D subject physiology, largely adopted in AP research and accepted by the American Food and Drug Administration as a replacement of preclinical animal trials for AP and 2) a real 7-patients' data set consisting of one month in free-living conditions. The satisfactory accuracy of the proposed approach paves the way to the embedding of these methodologies in AP systems or their deployment in remote monitoring systems."

The proposed framework aims to aid in the health and fitness industry based on body vitals, body movement and health related data. The framework is expected to assist athletes, trainers and physicians with the interpretation of multiple physical signs and raise alerts in case of any health hazard. We proposed a method to collect and analyze exercise specific data which can be used to measure exercise intensity and its benefit to athlete's health and serve as recommendation system for upcoming athletes. We determined the validity of the proposed framework by giving a six weeks workout plan with six days a week for workout activity targeting all muscles followed by one day for recovery. We recorded the electrocardiogram, heart rate, heart rate variability, breath rate, and determined athlete's movement using a 3D-acceleration. The collected data in the research is used in two modules. A Health zone module implemented on body vitals data which categorizes athlete's health state into various categories. Hzone module is responsible for health hazards identification and alarming. Outstandingly, the Hzone module is able to identify an athlete's physical state with 97% accuracy. A gym activity recognition (GAR) module is implemented to recognize workout activity in real-time using body movements and body vitals data.

This led to an increased demand for remote healthcare systems using biosensors. These biosensors produce a large volume of sensed data that will be received by the edge of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) to be forwarded to the data centers of the cloud for further treatment. An edge-fog computing-enabled lossless electroencephalogram (EEG) data compression with epileptic seizure detection in IoMT networks is proposed in this article. The proposed approach achieves three functionalities. First, it reduces the amount of sent data from the edge to the fog gateway using lossless EEG data compression based on a hybrid approach of  $k$ -means clustering and Huffman encoding (KCHE) at the edge gateway. Second, it decides the epileptic seizure situation of the patient at the fog gateway based on the epileptic seizure detector-based Naive Bayes (ESDNB) algorithm. Third, it reduces the size of IoMT EEG data delivered to the cloud using the same lossless compression algorithm in the first step. Various measures implemented to show the effectiveness of the suggested approach and the comparison results confirm that the KCHE reduces the amount of EEG data transmitted to the fog and cloud platform and produces a suitable detection of an epileptic seizure. The average of compression power of the proposed KCHE is four times the average of compression power of other methods for all EEG records ( $Z, F, N, O$ , and  $S$ ). Furthermore, the proposed ESDNB outperforms the other methods in terms of accuracy, where it provides accuracy from 99.53 % up to 99.99 % using the data set of Bonn University."

Thus, data collection and annotation is an important step towards the successful development and realization of such systems. Nevertheless, in order to create reliable datasets, current data collection and annotation methodologies often require a controlled environment while also the presence of the volunteer contributing to the process, or any subject for that matter, and an expert, monitoring the procedure, is mandatory. These processes are heavily restrained by the recent COVID-19 pandemic outbreak.To address such issues, in this paper we propose a human-centered Web-based dataset creation and annotation tool that utilizes the Web Bluetooth API. The user can effectively collect gestures from a nearby device that supports the BLE protocol, assign tags to the collected data, and store them remotely, in real-time. The data storage, as well as its annotation, can also be performed remotely by an expert stakeholder. An off-the-shelf wearable sensorial device has been used indicatively for our tool demonstration purposes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt that exploits the Web Bluetooth API capabilities for the development of a Browser-based real-time data collection, storage, and annotation tool. Our tool can be also expanded to other applications that use the sensing device with only minor configuration changes and is also operable through any smart-device that supports a Web-Browser. Furthermore, our tool’s performance matches that of native applications’. Finally, the tool is successfully deployed and validated by integrating it into our ongoing ML platform that is related to allergic rhinitis gesture recognition."

Jemai,A metaplastic neural network technique for human activity recognition for Alzheimer’s patients,,"Artificial Intelligence technology has made a huge leap forward. However, the current systems still fall short when faced with the catastrophic challenge of forgetting. Deep neural networks face huge limitations, including the tendency to forget learned tasks as they perform new tasks. While neuroscience research suggests that the human brain synapses can overcome this challenge through the ability to adapt based on historical information, applying similar mechanisms to deep neural networks to prevent forgetting previous data proves to be a monumental task.In this study, our focus lies on using these improved deep networks to provide assistance to people afflicted with Alzheimer’s disease, a prevalent condition among the elderly. Due to cognitive impairments, individuals with Alzheimer’s often require ongoing support to carry out daily activities necessary for their well-being. To tackle the issue of forgetfulness in deep neural networks, specifically binary neural networks, and grant them the ability of multitasking and continuous learning, we propose an effective training method. This can be achieved by treating the hidden weights as semi-modifiable variables and adapting the training methodology accordingly. The proposed remote monitoring system consists of two main components. The first component is the Human Activity and Patient Behavior Monitoring (HAR) Identification Unit, which focuses on monitoring and identifying patterns in the activities and behaviors of Alzheimer’s patients. The second component is a support unit that detects anomalies and behavioral problems and provides appropriate warnings. This system is based on augmentative learning technology. As a result of our research, we have developed auxiliary systems specifically designed for Alzheimer’s patients. Activity details are as follows. We achieved excellent results for Activity 1 (Task 1) with an accuracy of 99.51% and Activity 2 (Task 2) was also well-addressed by our system, reaching an accuracy of 96.63%. Finally, we conducted a comparative study, comparing our system’s performance complexity with previous systems using the Dem@care Dataset."

However, assessments of postural instability, known as postural sway, leverage force platforms or wearable accelerometers, and are most often conducted in laboratory environments and are thus not broadly accessible. Remote measures of postural sway captured during daily life may provide a more accessible alterative, but their ability to capture disease status and fall risk has not yet been established. We explored the utility of remote measures of postural sway in a sample of 33 PwMS. Remote measures of sway differed significantly from lab-based measures, but still demonstrated moderately strong associations with patient-reported measures of balance and mobility impairment. Machine learning models for predicting fall risk trained on lab data provided an Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.79, while remote data only achieved an AUC of 0.51. Remote model performance improved to an AUC of 0.74 after a new, subject-specific k-means clustering approach was applied for identifying the remote data most appropriate for modelling. This cluster-based approach for analyzing remote data also strengthened associations with patient-reported measures, increasing their strength above those observed in the lab. This work introduces a new framework for analyzing data from remote patient monitoring technologies and demonstrates the promise of remote postural sway assessment for assessing fall risk and characterizing balance impairment in PwMS."

Nowadays, non-invasive healthcare monitoring systems based on wearable sensors and machine learning models hold the future of smart health. However, the nature of these methods is such that they get affected by internal physiological and external parameters, which is one of the obstacles to this path. This study aims to introduce a non-invasive blood glucose level classification method based on machine learning analysis. The device's sensor consists of an optical finger sensor that transmits near-infrared light, filtering, and amplification to reduce the noise of the extracted photoplethysmography signal. Moreover, we have adopted the four-stage framework of biomedical signal processing to analyze the acquired PPG signal. Before using the Savitzky-Golay derivation to pre-filter the signal and prepare it for feature extraction, it was normalized using Standard Normal Variate (SNV). In addition, four different machine learning models, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Weighted K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Wide Neural Network, and Decision Tree were used for blood glucose level classification. For this study, a dataset was created consisting of 106 data, gathered from 27 subjects. Findings revealed that the Weighted KNN exhibited the best performance among other classification models, having 90.5% accuracy."

Frequent, unobtrusive assessment of naturalistic motor performance could enable clinicians to better assess rehabilitation effectiveness and monitor patients' recovery trajectories. We therefore propose and validate a two-phase data analytic pipeline to estimate upper-limb impairment based on the naturalistic performance of activities of daily living (ADLs). Eighteen stroke survivors were equipped with an inertial sensor on the stroke-affected wrist and performed up to four ADLs in a naturalistic manner. Continuous inertial time series were segmented into sliding windows, and a machine-learned model identified windows containing instances of point-to-point (P2P) movements. Using kinematic features extracted from the detected windows, a subsequent model was used to estimate upper-limb motor impairment, as measured by the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA). Both models were evaluated using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. The P2P movement detection model had an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.72. FMA estimates had a normalized root mean square error of 18.8% with $R^{2}=0.72$. These promising results support the potential to develop seamless, ecologically valid measures of real-world motor performance."

Therefore, early fall detection, followed by reliable and timely notification, is vital to ensure the survival of firefighters. However, due to complex and diverse firefighting scenarios, current fall detection systems (FDSs) are inadequate, especially in terms of accuracy and real-time applications. Hence, in this study, a wearable pre-impact FDS (PIFDS) for firefighters is proposed. We also evaluated the feasibility of using machine learning (ML) and ensemble learning (EL) methods deployed on the edge node to simultaneously improve the real-time performance and accuracy. Moving thresholding method is introduced to overcome the class-imbalanced issue due to fewer samples acquired during the pre-impact (PI) phase. Based on 14 firefighters’ data collection, the experimental results revealed that a Decision Tree classifier with optimized parameters (DT-ED4) outperformed other ML and EL methods in a tradeoff between processing time and accuracy. The results also showed that our system can detect falls before the impact with an average lead time of 447.9 ms, sensitivity of 95.10%, and specificity of 97.99%. The system’s heterogeneous IoT network architecture facilitated remote monitoring and alerts that enabled the incident commander (IC) to execute the rescue mission immediately upon notification.

Among others, under-mattress ballistocardiogram (BCG) sensors have proved effective for contactless remote monitoring of HR. Nevertheless, HR detection from BCG sensors is a challenging task because the signal morphology can vary between and within-subjects. In this paper, we studied the potential of two wavelet-based methods, i.e., the multiresolution analysis of the maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT-MRA) and continuous wavelet transform (CWT) for HR detection via a microbend fiber optic sensor (MFOS). BCG signals were gathered from ten sleep apnea patients during overnight polysomnography (PSG) study. The MFOS was placed under the bed mattress and the PSG electrocardiogram (ECG) signals were used as a reference to evaluate the proposed HR detection algorithms. Overall, CWT with derivative of Gaussian provided (Gaus2) slightly better results compared with the MODWT-MRA, CWT (frequency Bspline), and CWT (Shannon). Across the ten patients, the mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error, and root mean square error metrics were as follows: 4.71 (1.22), 7.58% (2.17), and 5.58 (1.20), and 4.71 (1.07), 7.61% (1.65), and 5.59 (1.02), for Gau2 and MODWT-MRA, respectively.

Most existing models in this field have been developed temperature screening methods using RCNN, face temperature encoder (FTE), and a combination of data from wearable sensors for predicting respiratory rate (RR) and monitoring blood pressure. These methods aim to facilitate remote screening and monitoring of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and COVID-19. However, these models require inadequate computing resources and are not suitable for lightweight environments.

This shift is mainly due to the convergence of emergent technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT)-based healthcare, fifth generation (5G)-assisted networking, and data-driven analytics through artificial intelligence. The convergence, referred to as Healthcare 5.0, has improved healthcare services to support real-time analytics, user mobility, remote monitoring, and personalized user experience through decentralized applications. However, the medical supply chain systems and delivery operations among healthcare stakeholders suffer from limitations of harsh environmental conditions due to restricted zones, rough terrains, war-prone areas, poor road conditions, congested traffic, and remote locations. Thus, the Internet of Drones (IoD) is deployed in Healthcare 5.0 supply chains to streamline and expedite the medical delivery process through open channels (i.e. the Internet). However, the Internet is an open channel that is prone to malicious activities which can violate the privacy and confidentiality of patient data. Blockchain is a promising technology that can handle the security and reliability of drone delivery among untrusted open channels. Motivated by the aforementioned facts, we propose GaRuDa, a blockchain-based drone delivery scheme for Healthcare 5.0 applications. The proposed scheme integrates IoD and blockchain through 5G-enabled tactile Internet to facilitate low-latency responsive delivery of medical supplies that can be chronologically monitored and tracked among different stakeholders. We compared the proposed scheme with the traditional medical delivery scheme with payment gateways to demonstrate its effectiveness in terms of data storage, computation, and communication costs. The simulation results obtained show that the average transaction cost has been reduced by ≈ 44.56 percent, and 5G tactile Internet has a reduced latency of 0.051 ms compared to 18.3 ms in 4G LTE service. The average communication overheads have reduced by ≈ 67.34 percent compared to traditional 4G LTE and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing channels, which indicates the scheme's viability."

It paved the way for health-care systems to reaffirm their foundations by using different technologies such as sensors, wearables, mobile applications, drones, robots, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) and the Internet of Things (IoT). A lot of domains have been renovated such as diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring, as well as previously unprecedented domains such as contact tracing. Contact tracing, in conjunction with the emergence, spread, and public compliance for vaccines, was a critical step for controlling and limiting the spread of the pandemic. Traditional contact tracing is usually dependent on individuals ability to recall their interactions, which is challenging and yet not effective. Consequently, further development and usage of automated, privacy-preserving, digital contact-tracing was required. As the pandemic is coming to an end, it is vital to collect and learn the effective used technologies that aided in fighting the virus in order to be prepared for any future pandemics and to be aware of any literature gaps that must be filled. This paper surveys state-of-the-art architectures, platforms, and applications combating COVID-19 at each phase of the five basic contact tracing phases, including case identification, contacts identification and rapid exposure notification, surveillance, regular follow up and prevention.

Wu,Singlemode-Multimode-Singlemode Optical Fiber Sensor for Accurate Blood Pressure Monitoring,,"A dual-channel single-mode-multi-mode-single-mode (SMS) fiber optic sensor encapsulated by polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was proposed for the first time, for the simultaneous monitoring of the brachial and radial arteries for accurate blood pressure prediction. With the help of the machine learning algorithm Support Vector Regression (SVR), the SMS fiber sensor can continuously and accurately monitor the systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Commercial sphygmomanometers are used to calibrate the accuracy of blood pressure measurement. Compared with the single-channel system, this system can extract more pulse wave features for blood pressure prediction, such as radial artery transit time (RPTT), brachial artery transit time (BPTT), and the transit time difference between the radial artery and the brachial artery (DBRPTT). The results show that the performance of dual-channel blood pressure monitoring is more accurate than that of single-channel blood pressure monitoring in terms of the absolute value of the correlation coefficient (R) and the average value of the difference between SBP and DBP. In addition, both the single-channel and dual-channel blood pressure monitoring are in line with the Association for the Advancement of Medical Devices (AAMI), but the average deviation (DM, 0.06 mmHg) and standard deviation (SD, 1.54 mmHg) of dual-channel blood pressure monitoring are more accurate. The blood pressure monitoring system has the characteristics of low cost, high sensitivity, non-invasive and capability for remote real time monitoring, which can provide effective solution for intelligent health monitoring in the era of artificial intelligence in the future."

Aliverti,Data Quality Assessment for the Validation of Synchronization Performance in an Innovative Wireless Multi-Node Monitoring Platform,,"Nowadays the health-monitoring scenario increasingly demands acquisition platforms able to collect at the same time multiple bio-signals. The main engineering challenge is to make these multi-nodes platforms fully wireless and wearable, allowing their use during daily life activities. In order to keep sensing nodes synchronized with each other, these systems need structured wireless architectures (i.e. synchronization engines). In this paper we propose a quantitative analysis to evaluate and to improve the wireless synchronization engine of an innovative wearable multi-node monitoring platform. We exploited the data collector as time-logger and we evaluated data about synchronization delay during the tuning of different architecture parameters. In particular, we performed several data collections evaluating a range of different frequencies used to exchange synchronization packets and testing the introduction of a dynamic adaption in the Connection Interval (a specific Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) parameter). We achieved the overall best performance (1,18 16-MHz-ticks as synchronization delay median value, with 1,60 16-MHz-ticks as Min-Max range) adopting both 40 Hz as synchronization frequency and the Connection Interval dynamic adaption. Our final goal is to investigate the most performing settings in order to increase the quality of physiological data collected with the platform under analysis, considering the lower the synchronization delay, the higher the data quality."

The rise of home and wearable devices capable of monitoring cardiac conditions provides valuable opportunities for data-driven analysis and HFE detection. However, these devices frequently generate low-quality measurements with irregular sampling frequencies and high rates of missing data. Our paper presents a methodology that processes these measurements as a three-dimensional tensor, applying a low-rank tensor completion scheme to manage missing data effectively, thus facilitating anomaly detection without necessitating data imputation. We validate our method on a dataset from 4 patients with chronic HF in the compensation phase, collected at the Hospital Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Campus Bio-Medico in Rome, Italy. Our results demonstrate the tensor-based method’s superiority over traditional techniques, highlighting its potential for detecting anomalies within complex multivariate time series data.

It provides better medical identification to claim the features namely trustworthy, efficient, and resourceful. Moreover, the telecare services automate the remote healthcare monitoring process to ease professional workloads. Importantly, it is conceived to be more timesaving, economical, and easy healthcare access. Cloud-Based Medical Healthcare (CBMH) system is a standard platform that gives its support to the patients for emergency treatment from the medical experts over Internet communication. Since the medical records are very sensitive, security protection is much necessitated. In addition, patient anonymity should be well preserved. In 2016, Chiou et al. proposed a mutual authentication protocol for the Telecare Medical Information System (TMIS) using Cloud Environment (CE). They claim that their protocol satisfies patient anonymity. However, this paper proves that the Chiou et al. scheme is not only completely insecure against the patient anonymity, health-report revelation, health-report forgery, report confidentiality, and non-repudiation but also fails to validate the service access against verifiability, undeniability and unforgeability. In order to provide better mutual authenticity, this paper suggests the framework of smart service authentication to cross-examine the common secret session key among the communication entities. In order to examine the security properties, formal and informal verification was carried out. Lastly, to prove the security and performance efficiency of a system, the proposed SSA framework was implemented using FPGA and Moteiv TMote Sky-Mote. A proposed smart service authentication (SSA) framework is presented to ensure better data security between the patients and the physicians. The formal and informal security analysis proves the significance of the SSA framework model to withstand the security attacks such as health-report forgery, health-report revelation, server-spoofing etc. As a result, it is claimed that it can be well suited for TMIS."

The domain of healthcare has witnessed transformative advancements through the integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, fostering the emergence of patient-centric solutions. Respiratory ailments pose significant challenges to patients, necessitating precise management and monitoring. Existing conventional inhalers often lack automation, real time monitoring, data driven insights and overall polish that leads to suboptimal treatment, but in no way, it could match with other peripherals which have advanced quite significantly over the years. Our proposed solution presents an IoT-based smart inhaler that seamlessly captures inhalation data, securely transmits it to the cloud, and employs data analytics to offer personalized recommendations. One of the key innovations of our project is the integration of real-time monitoring and feedback. By equipping the Nebulizer device with sensors and communication modules, we empower users with instant insights into their Nebulizer usage patterns. Comparison reveals that while conventional inhalers offer basic functionality, they lack the data-driven insights and remote monitoring capabilities of the IoT smart nebulizer.

However, BP is usually measured using cuff-based devices with tedious operation in practice, which may not be cost effective for continuous BP tracking. In this article, we propose a novel attention-based multitask network with a weighting scheme for BP estimation by analyzing and modeling single lead electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method could achieve mean error of systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and mean arterial pressure estimation in levels of 0.18 ± 10.83, 1.24 ± 5.90, and 0.84 ± 6.47 mmHg, respectively. In comparison to other cutting-edge methods using ECG signals, the proposed method shows superior BP estimation performance. By integrating with a wearable/portable ECG monitoring device, the proposed model can be deployed to an embedded system or remote healthcare intelligent system to provide long-term BP monitoring service, which would help to reduce the incidence of malignant events happened in hypertensive population."

This study introduces a remote sensing method that offers both direct and wide-area sensing of soil properties using a dispersible, biodegradable cuboid-shaped isotropic metamaterial equipped with a water-soluble Mg-based resonance antenna structure. The symmetrical metal patterns ensure isotropic reflectance within the 1.2–3.6-GHz range, enabling robust sensing even when the metamaterial is dispersed randomly on the soil. The degradation of the Mg antenna in the soil presents a significant reflection reduction from 80% to 20% at a 2.4-GHz resonant frequency on the soil, promoting the feasibility of combination with a simple wireless measurement system.

Singh,An Algorithm to Impute Missing Values in Medical Datasets to Predict the Risk of Diseases in Patients,,"The advent of Internet of Things (IoT) revolutionizes the healthcare sector by altering how medical equipment and humans interact while providing healthcare solutions. Applications of IoT in healthcare are advantageous to patients, their families, physicians, hospitals, and insurance companies. Before the IoT, patients could only speak with doctors physically, over the phone, or by text. There wasn’t a practical way for medical staff or facilities to continuously assess patients' health and provide guidance. Remote monitoring in the healthcare industry is made possible by utilizing sensor devices that help physicians to deliver superlative care to their patients. Sensor devices play a crucial role in the remote monitoring of patients. However, the failure of network or sensor devices may result in data with missing values. This incomplete data cannot be utilized to diagnose a patient or to make effective predictions of the disease in early diagnosis. To ensure the effective diagnosis and predict the risk of diseases in the patient, this paper proposed a novel ReMiss (Removing Missingness in medical datasets) algorithm to impute the missing values present in incomplete medical datasets. The proposed ReMiss algorithm is a data-partitioning based missing values imputation technique that partitions the datasets into complete and incomplete subsets to predict the missing values efficiently. The adjusted coefficient of determination, RMSEs and classification accuracy are the performance metrics used to evaluate the performance of the proposed ReMiss algorithm with the existing imputation techniques. The proposed ReMiss algorithm obtained an average classification accuracy of 93.53%."

Ward,Synthetic Sensor Data for Human Activity Recognition,,"Human activity recognition (HAR) based on wearable sensors has emerged as an active topic of research in machine learning and human behavior analysis because of its applications in several fields, including health, security and surveillance, and remote monitoring. Machine learning algorithms are frequently applied in HAR systems to learn from labeled sensor data. The effectiveness of these algorithms generally relies on having access to lots of accurately labeled training data. But labeled data for HAR is hard to come by and is often heavily imbalanced in favor of one or other dominant classes, which in turn leads to poor recognition performance. In this study we introduce a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based approach for HAR that we use to automatically synthesize balanced and realistic sensor data. GANs are robust generative networks, typically used to create synthetic images that cannot be distinguished from real images. Here we explore and construct a model for generating several types of human activity sensor data using a Wasserstein GAN (WGAN). We assess the synthetic data using two commonly-used classifier models, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). We evaluate the quality and diversity of the synthetic data by training on synthetic data and testing on real sensor data, and vice versa. We then use synthetic sensor data to oversample the imbalanced training set. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method on two publicly available human activity datasets, the Sussex-Huawei Locomotion (SHL) and Smoking Activity Dataset (SAD). We achieve improvements of using WGAN augmented training data over the imbalanced case, for both SHL (0.85 to 0.95 F1-score), and for SAD (0.70 to 0.77 F1-score) when using a CNN activity classifier."

Vats,Heterogeneous Wireless Access Networks for IoT and E-Health-A Survey,,"In a heterogeneous wireless environment, there are many different radio access technologies (RATs), such as Wi-Fi and 2G, 3G, 4G, and 5G, which each have a different degree of coverage and processing power to meet various service requirements. A mobile user may have access to various access networks in such a situation. On the PC of each user, numerous programs with varied Quality of Service (QoS) requirements can operate simultaneously. It would be advantageous for a multi-interface terminal to use two or more interfaces simultaneously in order to improve performance. However, using multiple networks at once could use up more energy than just using one interface. Therefore, energy use must to be taken into account when analyzing the Flow/Interface Relationship (FIA). This paper presents a novel method for choosing the ideal FIA that achieves the best trade-off between all the characteristics taken into account, dubbed Smart Tabu Search (STS). STS considers user preferences, network circumstances, network expenses, application QoS specifications, and battery life of mobile devices. We use simulations and testbed experiments to validate our concept. Professionals are now able to diagnose and monitor patients remotely because to the growing use of healthcare monitoring devices. One of the most frequent occurrences that affects the reliability of information transmission in any network is congestion, which is defined as the unchecked increase in traffic relative to network capacity. With the use of a mesh network, wireless sensors, and some of the most significant models for vital signs, the article aims to provide a realistic simulation environment for a healthcare system. The simulator environment is a helpful tool for assessing the dependability and effectiveness of the healthcare system in a realistic setting. However, the system is not appropriate for real-time applications due to the sluggish network adaption caused by the end-to-end based traffic regulation decision. In more recent scheduling techniques, additional scheduling factors were taken into account, including the priority order of inserting packets using a fixed priority algorithm based on Priority Queuing (PQ), user-defined. Context priorities, user-defined profile priorities, the applications and devices that are currently active, the number of their direct neighboring nodes, the average link quality, and user preferences. A cutting-edge paradigm for communication called the Internet of Things (IoT) permits online connections between parts from various domains. The traditional healthcare system has a growing need for social resources like doctors, nurses, hospital beds, and health monitoring gadgets, making modern healthcare one of the most alluring IoT applications. In this paper, a design for a small wearable sensor patch that can gauge body temperature, photo plethysmography, and the electrocardiogram (ECG) is given. The suggested sensor patch can be used to constantly estimate blood pressure (BP) based on the pulse arrival time (PAT) without the need for additional cables or equipment because ECG and PPG sensors are combined in one device. Three sensors are used to monitor vital signs, a central board is used to analyze and collect signals, and a power board is used to provide power and charge batteries. The entire set of parts is made with a rigid-flexible construction that permits rapid attachment to the body for applications like remote health monitoring. For specialized measurements of a particular physiological signal (such an ECG), the sensors can be taken out of the main board in order to save power. By comparing the suggested sensor patch to a commercial reference device, experiments are done to verify its performance.

This standard was developed for wireless communication at a short-range, around the human body with low power requirements. This standard allows 2hop star topology within an intra-MBAN so that when direct communication is not possible, alternate routes are available through relays. This paper proposes a protocol for an intra-MBAN topology, which is a novel T-Relay mechanism that implements the 2-hop star topology. To validate the proposed protocol, it was tested on OMNeT ++ framework with Castalia Simulator for various scenarios. The simulation results show that the T-Relay mechanism enhances the PDR when the channel has variations."

Existing technologies have brought forth a plethora of applications that could not have been imagined in the past years. B5G will enable us to rethink the capability it will offer in various sectors, including agriculture, search and rescue, and, more specifically, in the delivery of health-care services. Unobtrusive and noninvasive measurements using radio-frequency (RF) sensing, monitoring, and the control of wearable medical devices are the areas that would potentially benefit from B5G. Applications such as RF sensing, device charging, and remote patient monitoring will be a key challenge in using millimeter-wave (mm-wave) communication. The mm-waves experience multipath-induced fading, where the rate of attenuation is larger as compared to microwaves. Eventually, mm-wave communication systems would require range extenders and guided surfaces. A proposed solution is the use of intelligent reflective surfaces, which will have the ability to manipulate electromagnetic (EM) signals. These intelligent surfaces mounted and/or coated on walls, also known as intelligent walls (IWs), are planar and active surfaces, which will be a key element in B5G and 6G communication.

However, errors in infusion rate can lead to over-dosing and under-dosing, potentially causing severe side effects for patients. To prevent incidents, medical staff visually monitors medication injection information (MIF) such as current flow rates (CFR) and injection volume. In this study, we propose an internet of things (IoT) system that automatically controls the CFR and remotely monitors the MIF. First, a peristaltic pump is designed to infuse parenteral fluids based on the “drop-by-drop” phenomenon. Second, a computer vision-based on deep learning algorithm provides real-time video and counts the fluid dropping to derive the MIF. Finally, the CFR is automatically applied as a feedback signal to regulate the infusion cycle of the peristaltic pump. After embedding all systems in our prototype, we evaluate the system performance according to IV therapy protocols used in clinical practice. In our experiments, the mean accuracy of the fluid injection using the peristaltic pump was 99.23% and the dropping count was the highest at 98.25%. Furthermore, the average accuracy of the CFR using the feedback system was 99.3%.

Gutierrez,A Lightweight Unidimensional Deep Learning Model for Atrial Fibrillation Detection,,"Continuous rhythm monitoring using wearable devices is a potential tool for early identification of atrial fibril-lation (AF), the most frequent cardiac arrhythmia (with 0,51% worldwide prevalence, increasing with time), and is also a tool for remote monitoring patients after cardiac surgery. However, AF detection directly through wearable devices is limited by the computational complexity of the classifier model. In this work we propose a lightweight AF classifier model based on the VGG-11 architecture (Lite VGG-11), focusing on reducing the number of parameters and nu-merical operations. Using a low number of filters, depth-wise separable convolution, and global pooling, this model has only 20,454 parameters and needs 6.9 MFLOP to make an inference for an input of 10 seconds of the ECG leads I and II, sampled at 200 Hz. To test its effectiveness for AF detection we used the PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2021 public dataset, stratifying the classes into sinus rhythm, AF, and other rhythms. After 10 Monte Carlo cross-validation splits, with 24,260 unbalanced samples for training and 1,536 balanced samples for validation and testing, the observed met-rics (mean±standard deviation) were: Se 94.1±0.1%; Sp 91.9±0.8%; F1-Score 89.50.7±%; and AUC 96.1±0.6%."

Parizi,Blockchain Technology and Neural Networks for the Internet of Medical Things,,"In today's technological climate, users require fast automation and digitization of results for large amounts of data at record speeds. Especially in the field of medicine, where each patient is often asked to undergo many different examinations within one diagnosis or treatment. Each examination can help in the diagnosis or prediction of further disease progression. Furthermore, all produced data from these examinations must be stored somewhere and available to various medical practitioners for analysis who may be in geographically diverse locations. The current medical climate leans towards remote patient monitoring and AI-assisted diagnosis. To make this possible, medical data should ideally be secured and made accessible to many medical practitioners, which makes them prone to malicious entities. Medical information has inherent value to malicious entities due to its privacy-sensitive nature in a variety of ways. Furthermore, if access to data is distributively made available to AI algorithms (particularly neural networks) for further analysis/diagnosis, the danger to the data may increase (e.g., model poisoning with fake data introduction). In this paper, we propose a federated learning approach that uses decentralized learning with blockchain-based security and a proposition that accompanies that training intelligent systems using distributed and locally-stored data for the use of all patients. Our work in progress hopes to contribute to the latest trend of the Internet of Medical Things security and privacy."

Standard 12-Lead ECG setup is most commonly used by doctors for the diagnosis. But the promising type of wearable ECG device uses minimal wire setup on the body to increase patients' comfort resulting in fewer recorded leads, mainly single lead. There is a need to reconstruct the remaining leads from these less recorded leads. Accounting for this, we are proposing a novel Single Lead to 12-Lead ECG reconstruction methodology using convolution neural networks (CNN) and long short term memory (LSTM). In the proposed methodology, lead-II is taken as the basis lead to reconstruct the remaining independent leads (I, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, and V6). Seven individual models corresponding to the above mentioned seven independent leads have been trained, where each model takes lead-II as input and gives I/V1/V2/V3/V4/V5/V6 as output. Leads III, aVR, aVL, and aVF are reconstructed using a standard approach using original lead II and reconstructed lead I signals, without the need for deep learning models. The proposed methodology was evaluated on myocardial infarction data from PTBDB using R2 statistics, correlation coefficient, and regression coefficient. The mean values averaged across all the 11 leads of the stated performance metrics obtained were 93.62%, 0.973, and 0.959, respectively."

This advancement revolutionizes the early detection and management of diseases such as Parkinson Disease (PD). Due to the loss of dopamine-producing neurons, PD is a progressive central nervous system condition that affects fundamental motor abilities, with hand tremors often being the first symptom. Despite the importance of early diagnosis, there is currently no conclusive test for PD. In our work, we consider a diagnostic tool for the early detection and diagnosis of PD by analyzing hand-drawn spiral and wave patterns.

Recognizing and tracing individuals via markerless motion capture systems in multi-person settings poses challenges due to obstructions, varying light conditions, and intricate interactions among subjects. In contrast, methods based on data gathered by Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) located in wearables grapple with other issues, including the precision of the sensors and their optimal placement on the body. We claim that more accurate results can be achieved by mixing Human Pose Estimation (HPE) techniques with information collected by wearables. To do that, we introduce a real-time platform that fuses HPE and IMU data to track and identify people. It exploits a matching model that consists of two synergistic components: the first employs a geometric approach, correlating orientation, acceleration, and velocity readings from the input sources. The second utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to yield a correlation coefficient for each HPE and IMU data pair. The proposed platform achieves promising results in identification and tracking, with an accuracy rate of 96.9%."

Through omnipresent monitoring, they aim to raise user awareness and encourage positive health behavior change. Yet, ubiquitous technologies suffer from expectation mismatch, lack of user-centric adaptiveness, and, ultimately, high abandonment rates. This work is motivated by the vital need to tailor and personalize ubiquitous technologies while dealing with the challenges arising from the lack of user profiling and the absence of relevant, self-reported user data. To this end, we show that the automatically passively collected sensing data from the wearables can be exploited to improve personalization and infer several user states relevant to demographic, physiological, psychological, and personality aspects, complementing the need for time-consuming self-reports.

Such an approach could allow continuous monitoring of clinically relevant biomechanical variables that are ideal for personalizing rehabilitation. In this paper, we introduce the notion of a muscle synergy function which describes the synergistic relationship between a subset of muscles. We develop from first principles an approximation to their behavior using Gaussian process regression and demonstrate the utility of the technique for estimating the excitation time-series of leg muscles during normal walking for nine healthy subjects. Specifically, excitations for six muscles were estimated using surface electromyography (sEMG) data during a finite time interval (called the input window) from four different muscles (called the input muscles) with mean absolute error (MAE) less than 5.0% of the maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) and that accounts for 82-88% of the variance (VAF) in the true excitations. Further, these estimated excitations informed muscle activations with less than 4.0% MAE and 89-93% VAF. We also present a detailed analysis of a number of different modeling choices, including every possible combination of four-, three- and two-muscle input sets, the size and structure of the input window, and the stationarity of the Gaussian process covariance functions.

Shen,Networking Architecture and Key Supporting Technologies for Human Digital Twin in Personalized Healthcare: A Comprehensive Survey,,"Digital twin (DT), referring to a promising technique to digitally and accurately represent actual physical entities, has attracted explosive interests from both academia and industry. One typical advantage of DT is that it can be used to not only virtually replicate a system’s detailed operations but also analyze the current condition, predict the future behavior, and refine the control optimization. Although DT has been widely implemented in various fields, such as smart manufacturing and transportation, its conventional paradigm is limited to embody non-living entities, e.g., robots and vehicles. When adopted in human-centric systems, a novel concept, called human digital twin (HDT) has thus been proposed. Particularly, HDT allows in silico representation of individual human body with the ability to dynamically reflect molecular status, physiological status, emotional and psychological status, as well as lifestyle evolutions. These prompt the expected application of HDT in personalized healthcare (PH), which can facilitate the remote monitoring, diagnosis, prescription, surgery and rehabilitation, and hence significantly alleviate the heavy burden on the traditional healthcare system. However, despite the large potential, HDT faces substantial research challenges in different aspects, and becomes an increasingly popular topic recently. In this survey, with a specific focus on the networking architecture and key technologies for HDT in PH applications, we first discuss the differences between HDT and the conventional DTs, followed by the universal framework and essential functions of HDT. We then analyze its design requirements and challenges in PH applications. After that, we provide an overview of the networking architecture of HDT, including data acquisition layer, data communication layer, computation layer, data management layer and data analysis and decision making layer. Besides reviewing the key technologies for implementing such networking architecture in detail, we conclude this survey by presenting future research directions of HDT."

These devices, empowered by artificial intelligence (AI), are broadening their utility in areas such as speech recognition, augmented reality, pose recognition, and health care monitoring, thereby enriching user experiences through novel interactive interfaces driven by embedded sensors. However, the widespread adoption of wireless earbuds has spurred concerns regarding security and privacy, necessitating robust bespoke security measures. Despite the miniaturization of mobile chips enabling the integration of sophisticated algorithms into smart wearables, the research and industrial communities have yet to accord adequate attention to earbud security. This article focuses on empowering wireless earbuds to authenticate their legitimate users, tackling the challenges associated with conventional authentication methods. Instead of relying on input interface authentication methods like PIN or lock patterns, this research delves into leveraging inertial measurement unit (IMU) data collected during interactions with devices to extract novel biometric features, presenting an alternative approach that nonetheless confronts challenges related to signal capture and interference. Consequently, we propose and design BudsAuth, an implicit user authentication framework that harnesses built-in IMU sensors in smart earbuds to capture vibration signals induced by on-face touching interactions with the earbuds. These vibrations are utilized to deliver continuous and implicit user authentication with high precision and compatibility across various earbud models.

It can be captured by optical fiber sensor in a non-invasive way. Besides, some significant physiological information, such as heart rate (HR) and respiration rate (RR), can also be extracted from BCG signal. As a medical instrument characterized by low power consumption, no interference, no invasion and the capability of real-time health monitoring, optical fiber sensor provides an effective solution to health care monitoring. However, when long-term monitoring of HR and RR is required for patients, it is necessary to collect a large amount of BCG data, which incurs a considerable amount of time and labor costs. To solve this problem, a novel deep learning model is proposed in this paper, namely ELA. Long-short term memory (LSTM) has the capability to memorize long-distance information states. According to this method, the improved empirical mode decomposition (EMD) algorithm (VEMD) is applied to convert the complex problem of HR and RR time series prediction into multiple sub-problems with relatively simple intrinsic mode function (IMF) component sequence prediction. Then, the proposed ELA model is adopted to model the HR and RR sub-sequences decomposed by VEMD. Accordingly, the results of IMF component subsequence prediction are obtained, with all the prediction results linearly summed to obtain the final prediction result. Moreover, experimental results are obtained to demonstrate the superiority of ELA and the R2 is 0.9946, indicating the excellent performance of the proposed model in the assessment and prediction of vital signs."

The effective control of mean arterial pressure (MAP) in a closed-loop manner is particularly critical for individuals who are critically ill or in the process of recovering from surgical procedures. Within the framework of the present research, an adaptive closed-loop structure has been formulated with the objective of controlling a patient’s MAP through governed administration of the medication sodium nitroprusside (SNP), to attain the desired MAP levels under varying conditions. The proposed closed-loop technique incorporates an intelligent controller known as the active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) with the intention of tracking the desired MAP value, alongside the utilization of continuous action policy gradient (CAPG) for the optimization of the controller’s coefficients. Under the DRL strategy, an actor is responsible for generating policy requests, while a critic assesses the efficacy of the actor’s policy directives. This approach uses gradient descent to train the weight values of both actor and critic networks, and it is dependent on the reward return linked to the MAP fault. Upon comparing the outcomes of the recommended structure with conventional models, numerical simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed system in coping with varying working conditions, key-value fluctuations, and uncertainties, while effectively maintaining the desired mean arterial pressure and drug administration rate."

The launch of 5G in smart healthcare networks is therefore a boom for IoT devices that provides an enhancement in network performance and expend cellular coverage. This paper reviewed several aspects of 5G and IoT architectures. Also, this research work presents the future aspects of 5G-IoT based smart healthcare system architecture, which provides better healthcare for patients in the future."

Our designed sensor can remotely monitor BP, HR, and SpO2. Our device collects, evaluates, predicts, and reads health data and then stores it on a remote platform named “ThinkSpeak,” which forms an IoT platform, with a 0.91 organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) screen display for viewing numerical health readings locally. We used a biomedical sensor device with an embedded signal condition unit, and a single photoplethysmography (PPG) signal was employed to derive and measure the PPG signal. A computer-based algorithm was generated, which factored in selected beneficial parameters measured from a single bio-inspired PPG signal. The measured PPG signal was used to estimate the individual user’s BP (both systolic and diastolic values), HR, and SpO2. An automatic multiscale-based peak (AMBP) detection algorithm was developed to obtain the maximum peak of the PPG signal. Furthermore, the developed sensor was benchmarked against two standard commercially available measurement devices: a Contec ambulatory BP sensor and a Braun pulse oximeter monitor. Our developed sensor is worn as a ring sensor and is interfaced with an Arduino 1010 WIFI MKR for remote health monitoring. Our estimated BP, HR, and SpO2 values were remotely monitored and a graphical representation was constructed."

Hammoudeh,Random Forest for Data Aggregation to Monitor and Predict COVID-19 Using Edge Networks,,"Medical sensors and distributed edge networks hold promise in advanced control and prediction of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19. Their integration can lower communication latency, bandwidth utilization, and energy consumption while achieving high application scalability and reliability. Existing edge-devices-enabled e-healthcare frameworks face two serious challenges that affect their success. First, real-time medical sensors generate similar or redundant readings used for disease prediction, mostly for non-COVID-19 patients, which increases data transmission latency and energy consumption. Second, predicting the risk level of COVID-19 patients using lightweight machine learning requires minimal training time to be useful. To address these challenges, we develop an edge-centric e-healthcare framework for online health data monitoring and analysis to predict the risk level of COVID-19 patients. In the proposed framework, a statistical data aggregation method (MEAN function) is deployed at local gateway devices to remove redundant data to minimize communication latency and energy usage. Geo-distributed edge servers are used to predict with 97 percent accuracy the risk level to each patient with Random Forest (RF) on the aggregated data. Finally, the efficiency of the RF algorithm is demonstrated with standard classification techniques."

With the continuous growth in the world’s older population, smart homecare becomes increasingly crucial in providing in-home care for older adults, allowing the vital healthcare dollars to go further into other critical care needs. In addition, with the rise in the development and utilisation of innovative technologies in healthcare settings, it is vital to ensure that these technologies are guided and approved by the corresponding regulatory bodies such as FDA (Foods and Drug Administration) in the USA and TGA (Therapeutic Good Administration) in Australia. With this premise, this paper identifies four dimensions for researchers to consider when developing smart homecare solutions for in-home remote care: Technology, Data, People, and Operational Environment. The essential interplays amongst these four dimensions are discussed to identify the various enablers and barriers in the successful delivery of smart homecare solutions. As the primary output of this paper, it proposes a conceptual framework to achieve practical in-home care for the older population living independently with the support of technology, while addressing the challenges such as security and privacy of patient data. Secondly, a comprehensive and practical guide featuring seven phases is presented to support and direct researchers in implementing smart homecare solutions for remote care.

Existing fall detection systems are often passive and require pushbutton to alarm care providers. The delay can cause significant consequences and damages to the patients. Early detection is vital for quick recovery and prevention of post injuries. Recent sensory detections often use pre-settings to predict fall, hence can cause false alarms. Further, they often cannot furnish vital information for treatment. A smart fall detection system can alleviate those concerns and pinpoint what happened and transfers vital data. We propose an active detection system using IoT in patient’s surroundings environment detecting falls, which immediately alarms the care providers and transmits vital information for treatment. The system integrates advanced ICT technologies to monitor, detect, and react to the falls. The system uses ANN to improve fall detections."

Yoon,A Novel Semi-Supervised Learning Model for Smartphone-Based Health Telemonitoring,,"Telemonitoring is the use of electronic devices such as smartphones to remotely monitor patients. It provides great convenience and enables timely medical decisions. To facilitate the decision making for each patient, a model is needed to translate the data collected by the patient’s smartphone into a predicted score for his/her disease severity. To train a robust predictive model, semi-supervised learning (SSL) provides a viable approach by integrating both labeled and unlabeled samples to leverage all the available data from each patient. There are two challenging issues that need to be simultaneously addressed in using SSL for this problem: (1) feature selection from high-dimensional noisy telemonitoring data; and (2) instance selection from many, possibly redundant unlabeled samples. We propose a novel SSL model allowing for simultaneous feature and instance selection, namely the S2SSL model. We present a real-data application of telemonitoring for patients with Parkinson’s Disease using their smartphone-collected activity data such as tapping and speaking. A total of 382 features were extracted from the activity data of each patient. 74 labeled and 563 unlabeled instances from 37 patients were used to train S2SSL. The trained model achieved a high accuracy of 0.828 correlation between the true and predicted disease severity scores on a validation dataset. Note to Practitioners—Telemonitoring is an emerging health care platform enabled by smartphones and wearables. Because it allows for health data to be collected anytime and anywhere, patients can be frequently monitored and medical decisions can be made more timely and effectively. This paper addresses the data science challenges in leveraging the telemonitoring platform to benefit patient care. Specifically, we propose a new model, S2SSL, to tackle these challenges and provide better robustness, accuracy, and efficiency. This paper may be interesting to health care practitioners seeking advanced analytics capabilities to model and integrate the data collected through telemonitoring devices, with ultimate purposes of improving the decision in treating each patient and increasing patient access to specialized care."

Over the last few years, the evolution of CPS, including IoT components, has significantly impacted many facets of people’s lifestyles. It has been immersed in a wide range of services and applications in various areas, including manufacturing, healthcare, and energy. However, the interrelationship between the cyber and physical worlds gives rise to a multitude of research problems and challenges. In the healthcare field, for instance, CPS introduces complexities related to interoperability, privacy, data security, and real-time data processing with critical implications for the reliability and safety of medical processes.

Chon,Optimized Signal Quality Assessment for Photoplethysmogram Signals Using Feature Selection,,"Objective: With the increasing use of wearable healthcare devices for remote patient monitoring, reliable signal quality assessment (SQA) is required to ensure the high accuracy of interpretation and diagnosis on the recorded data from patients. Photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals non-invasively measured by wearable devices are extensively used to provide information about the cardiovascular system and its associated diseases. In this study, we propose an approach to optimize the quality assessment of the PPG signals. Methods: We used an ensemble-based feature selection scheme to enhance the prediction performance of the classification model to assess the quality of the PPG signals. Our approach for feature and subset size selection yielded the best-suited feature subset, which was optimized to differentiate between the clean and artifact corrupted PPG segments. Conclusion: A high discriminatory power was achieved between two classes on the test data by the proposed feature selection approach, which led to strong performance on all dependent and independent test datasets. We achieved accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity rates of higher than 0.93, 0.89, and 0.97, respectively, for dependent test datasets, independent of heartbeat type, i.e., atrial fibrillation (AF) or non-AF data including normal sinus rhythm (NSR), premature atrial contraction (PAC), and premature ventricular contraction (PVC). For independent test datasets, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity rates were greater than 0.93, 0.89, and 0.97, respectively, on PPG data recorded from AF and non-AF subjects. These results were found to be more accurate than those of all of the contemporary methods cited in this work. Significance: As the results illustrate, the advantage of our proposed scheme is its robustness against dynamic variations in the PPG signal during long-term 14-day recordings accompanied with different types of physical activities and a diverse range of fluctuations and waveforms caused by different individual hemodynamic characteristics, and various types of recording devices. This robustness instills confidence in the application of the algorithm to various kinds of wearable devices as a reliable PPG signal quality assessment approach."

Several studies attempted to detect the physiological value from the captured image using optical character recognition (OCR). However, the technology has limited availability with high cost. Thus, this study aimed to propose a novel framework called pandemic accelerated human-machine collaboration (PACMAN) with a low-resource deep learning-based computer vision. We compared state-of-the-art object detection algorithms (scaled YOLOv4, YOLOv5, and YOLOR), including the commercial OCR tools for digit recognition on the captured images from the pulse oximeter display. All images were derived from crowdsourced data collection with varying quality and alignment. YOLOv5 was the best performing model against the given model comparison across all data sets, notably the correctly orientated image data set. We further improved the model performance with the digits auto-orientation algorithm and applied a clustering algorithm to extract SpO2 and PR values. The accuracy performance of YOLOv5 with the implementations was approximately 81.0–89.5%, which was enhanced compared to without any additional implementation. Accordingly, this study highlighted the completion of the PACMAN framework to detect and read digits in real-world data sets. The proposed framework has been currently integrated into the patient monitoring system utilized by hospitals nationwide."

Although, these technologies have increased the treatment’s precision but the growing number and the complexity of IoT healthcare devices are impacting accuracy along with several other challenges. Moreover, the use of different programming languages, operating platforms and data management methodologies are creating restrictions in safe exchange, integration and reuse of information across different applications. However, with the advent of the semantic web, the semantic technologies are growing in healthcare systems due to the capability of machine interpretation and processing by overcoming the restriction of languages and data heterogeneity. The most common shortcoming in the existing systems are the context-awareness and quality of services and the absence of rich patient ontology; leading towards low accuracy of results. To this aim, this paper provides a smart health framework, consisting on the collection and processing of IoT data (related to patient conditions and context). The framework is supported by the patient ontology along with SWRL rules for better decision making that consider different features (context-awareness and quality of services) differently that results in the improved accuracy.

Although implementing an accurate HAR model is essential, developing a personalized one and adapting it to the end-user is challenging in real-life applications. There are various personalization methods in HAR. This research combines two personalization methods to adapt the proposed HAR model to individual subjects. Accordingly, we developed an Android application to capture the accelerometers of fifteen subjects during six predefined daily activities, such as standing, sitting, lying down, walking, going upstairs, and going downstairs. Subjects were instructed to carry the phone in predetermined positions in fixed or free modes. These positions include locations where people mostly carry their smartphones. The proposed personalized HAR model consisted of two main steps: (1) the dataset was divided into multiple groups based on the subjects' physical similarities, e.g., such as weight and height. Then, (2) based on multiple data splitting configurations (user-independent, user-dependent, and hybrid), the HAR model is generalized to the end-user in each group using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).

The ability to connect devices and collect data from them has the potential to transform the way it monitors and treat patients. However, the security and privacy of this data is a major concern. The cryptography and other conventional methods for security in resource constrained MIoT has several shortcomings. First, it does not provide adequate protection for patient data. Second, it is not designed to work with the large number of devices and huge volumes of data that are typically generated in MIoT applications. In this article, secure M-Trust privacy protocol (SMP) has been designed to address these issues. The SMP protocol uses a combination of trust, cryptographic, and machine learning techniques to provide security and privacy for data in transit. The SMP protocol has been designed to work with the smart health care monitoring system to provide a secure and private communication channel between devices in the system. The SMP protocol is an improvement over the existing security and privacy protocols for medical data. The simulation results proves that the SMP protocol is more efficient and scalable than the existing protocols. The SMP protocol is a valuable addition to the MIoT landscape and can help improve the privacy of data exchanged between medical devices."

However, medical devices are usually challenging to deploy due to privacy regulations, and they generally leverage a centralized third party. Enabling data sharing would enhance new medical studies, formulate new treatments, and deliver new digital health technologies. Solving the issue will have a triple impact: we will handle sensitive information easily, contribute to international medical advancements, and enable personalized care. A possible solution is to exploit decentralization distributing privacy concerns directly to users. Solutions enabling this vision are closely linked to Distributed Ledger Technologies. Through its characteristics of immutability and transparency, this technology would allow privacy-compliant solutions in contexts where privacy is the first need. This paper envisions the InterPlanetary Health Layer and related real-world implementations in the Internet of Medical Things domain. The main idea of the proposed solution is to handle sensitive data by preserving privacy and guaranteeing data availability. Specifically, users can build their private network, collaboratively authorize operations among their data and manage their privacy conditions without relying on a third party.

The proposed system consists of an accelerometer and vibration sensor detect the uterine contractions. The signals are sent to Arduino wherein the normal and abnormal threshold are predefined. In case of abnormal contractions, the Arduino sends alert notification to the emergency contacts via Short Message Service (SMS) using Global System for Mobile communication (GSM) along with the location information of the individual using Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking. The device also sends emergency alert to the nearby hospital so that both maternal and neonatal care services are provided at the earliest.

Deb,i-Sheet: A Low-Cost Bedsheet Sensor for Remote Diagnosis of Isolated Individuals,,"In this article, we propose a smart bedsheet—i-Sheet—for remotely monitoring the health of COVID-19 patients. Typically, real-time health monitoring is very crucial for COVID-19 patients to prevent their health from deteriorating. Conventional healthcare monitoring systems are manual and require patient input to start monitoring health. However, it is difficult for the patients to give input in critical conditions as well as at night. For instance, if the oxygen saturation level decreases during sleep, then it is difficult to monitor. Furthermore, there is a need for a system that monitors post-COVID effects as various vitals get affected, and there are chances of their failure even after the recovery. i-Sheet exploits these features and provides the health monitoring of COVID-19 patients based on their pressure on the bedsheet. It works in three phases: 1) sensing the pressure exerted by the patient on the bedsheet; 2) categorizing the data into groups (comfortable and uncomfortable) based on the fluctuations in the data; and 3) alerting the caregiver about the condition of the patient. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of i-Sheet in monitoring the health of the patient. i-Sheet effectively categorizes the condition of the patient with an accuracy of 99.3% and utilizes 17.5 W of the power. Furthermore, the delay involved in monitoring the health of patients using i-Sheet is 2 s which is very diminutive and is acceptable."

Desai,Transforming Modern Medicine with the Role of the Healthcare Internet of Things in Enhancing Patient Care and Monitoring,,"The present healthcare sector is experiencing a fundamental upheaval with the emergence of the Healthcare Internet of Things (HIoT). This article delves into the transformational potential of HIoT by examining its use in bettering patient care and monitoring. The paper dives into the introduction of HIoT, the methodologies adopted for research and development, the compelling findings gained, and the farreaching consequences in conclusion The opening part sets the scene by describing the fundamental transformation in healthcare facilitated by HIoT. It emphasizes the catalyst for rethinking patient care and monitoring as the combination of internet-connected devices, smart sensors, and data analytics. HIoT equips doctors with up-to-the-minute information, allowing for more precise diagnoses and more individualized plans of care. Furthermore, deep learning and artificial intelligence were incorporated to exploit the richness of HIoTgenerated data, allowing sophisticated analytics and informed decision-making. The compelling findings of this study are clear, with the suggested technique regularly beating existing methods across numerous criteria. A remarkable accuracy score of 0.94 was reached, demonstrating the reliability of the suggested strategy in supporting informed healthcare decisions. Furthermore, in terms of cost efficiency, the suggested approach scored 0.95, suggesting its costeffectiveness and potential for economic viability. The development of HIoT promises a healthcare system that is more patient-centered, data-driven, and efficient in the future. To ensure healthcare continues to grow into an age of unmatched patient care and monitoring, researchers, healthcare providers, and governments must work together to harness this transformational potential while tackling the issues that come with it."

Gia,One-Dimensional CNN Approach for ECG Arrhythmia Analysis in Fog-Cloud Environments,,"Cardiovascular diseases are considered the number one cause of death across the globe which can be primarily identified by the abnormal heart rhythms of the patients. By generating electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, wearable Internet of Things (IoT) devices can consistently track the patient's heart rhythms. Although Cloud-based approaches for ECG analysis can achieve some levels of accuracy, they still have some limitations, such as high latency. Conversely, the Fog computing infrastructure is more powerful than edge devices but less capable than Cloud computing for executing compositionally intensive data analytic software. The Fog infrastructure can consist of Fog-based gateways directly connected with the wearable devices to offer many advanced benefits, including low latency and high quality of services. To address these issues, a modular one-dimensional convolution neural network (1D-CNN) approach is proposed in this work. The inference module of the proposed approach is deployable over the Fog infrastructure for analysing the ECG signals and initiating the emergency countermeasures within a minimum delay, whereas its training module is executable on the computationally enriched Cloud data centers. The proposed approach achieves the F1-measure score ≈1 on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database when applying GridSearch algorithm with the cross-validation method. This approach has also been implemented on a single-board computer and Google Colab-based hybrid Fog-Cloud infrastructure and embodied to a remote patient monitoring system that shows 25% improvement in the overall response time."

The proposed platform is able to support a new paradigm for the management of patients with COPD, by integrating clinical data and parameters monitored in daily life using Artificial Intelligence algorithms. Therefore, the doctor is provided with a dynamic picture of the disease and its impact on lifestyle and vice versa, and can thus plan more personalized diagnostics, therapeutics, and social interventions. This strategy allows for a more effective organization of access to outpatient care and therefore a reduction of emergencies and hospitalizations because exacerbations of the disease can be better prevented and monitored. Hence, it can result in improvements in patients' quality of life and lower costs for the healthcare system."

Pravisha,A Blockchain-Enabled IoT Framework for NICU Infant Health Monitoring System,,"According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 15 million infants are born prematurely each year. In the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), the critical health parameters of newborn babies must be monitored precisely and in real time. Approximately one million preterm babies suffer morbidity before the age of five due to preterm birth and complications associated with preterm delivery. The neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) requires accurate, real-time monitoring of newborn infants' vital health parameters. One of the challenges encountered by the majority of hospitals is the lack of systems that can track real-time health parameters and notify doctors and parents to indicate any neonatal critical conditions. This research article presents a framework that incorporates IoT, fog, deep learning technologies, Blockchain, and decentralized cloud for NICU newborn health monitoring. The development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain technologies provides wide opportunities for enhancing the data management of neonatal intensive care units. By integrating IoT devices comprising wearable sensors and smart monitors the system gets real-time data on vital signs like heart rate, temperature, blood oxygen levels, and breathing rate. Fog computing is used for the instantaneous analysis of critical data, and an efficient deep learning algorithm will be implemented at the fog layer to classify data into either critical or non-critical data. Since fog has limited resources, a private blockchain is used to store critical data. The critical data is stored temporarily on a private blockchain and permanently on a decentralized cloud."

Rahman,"Low Cost, Portable ECG Monitoring and Alarming System Based on Deep Learning",,"Electrocardiogram (ECG) has been the golden standard for the detection of cardiovascular disease for many years. Any electrical impulse disruption that causes the heart to the contract may lead to arrhythmia. Arrhythmia patients have no indications of having an arrhythmia, but a doctor may recognize arrhythmias in a routine test. Therefore, continuous wearable personal monitoring system plays a big role, and it's become popular day by day. This research focuses on designing and developing a method for predicting arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation) along with monitoring the ECG signals. To create an arrhythmia prediction model and an Android-based real-time ECG surveillance system, Long Short-Term Memories neural network, Recurrent Neural Network, TensorFlow and Keras library are applied here. Those deep learning models and algorithms help to achieve overall 97.57% accuracy on arrhythmia prediction. The system is being designed with Raspberry pi 3, Arduino UNO, AD8232 single lead ECG sensor, HC-05 Bluetooth, biomedical sensor pad and battery. This system will make easier for doctors to monitor the ECG of their patients outside the hospital and also help for remote ECG monitoring. The total components cost of this research work is around USD 58."

There is a rising demand for online monitoring of the health factors of a patient, who is staying at a remote location and elders suffering from health issues and not able to travel to the hospital. Safeguarding the privacy of the patient data is a paramount challenge while observing patient health conditions through IoT. We have introduced a Real-Time Distant Healthcare Monitoring IoT System (RTDHMIS) which protects the patient data using a lightweight block cipher BEST -1 (Better Encryption Security Technique-1). Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN) comprise many sensor nodes, which are implanted in the patient's body for data collection. Since wearable sensor nodes are resource-constrained devices, it is essential to use a lightweight cryptographic algorithm for data protection. The block cipher BEST -1 provides a good security mechanism against many known security attacks. The security and efficiency of the newly introduced system are compared with related systems and it is found that the performance of RTDHMIS is better for implementation in a healthcare environment."

Monitoring and controlling posture can be predictive of future falls in the elderly population and can also provide indications on the worsening in subjects suffering from neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis. In this context, wearables can be a good solution to ensure immediacy and applicability in the everyday life and a low-cost alternative to gold standard devices, such as the force platform and the stereophotogrammetric system. This work describes the hardware, firmware and software updates of SISTINE, a telemonitoring system based on a pair of sensorized socks and a sensorized belt that is able to monitor physical quantities in real time such as plantar pressures and accelerations of the body segments. A pilot study on posture assessment involved 8 healthy participants recruited at the “F oro Italico” University of Rome. The center of pressure and related parameters, such as the confidence ellipse, were extracted and analysed from the SISTINE system and provided an indication of the effectiveness of the use of the devices in the analysis of posture.

To enhance and personalise clinical management, it is important to assess the adherence and impact of pharmacological treatments on motor states (such as ON/OFF/DISKYNESIA, to cite a few). In this context, in addition to clinical assessments performed by PD specialists, it becomes crucial to leverage digital health technologies (e.g., wearable devices) that can collect motor symptoms objectively, continuously and remotely, so as to monitor participants even in an uncontrolled environment. This work aims to implement and validate an automatic motor state identification algorithm based on a novel energy-based composite index capturing mobility and motor symptom fluctuations occurring during the day. This work aims to identify and validate an energy-based composite index, whose evaluation and comparison with a suitable computed threshold can help identifying different motor states and correlate the quantitative information with well-validated clinical scales, to give a double response: i) the efficacy of the pharmacological treatment during daily life (OFF states identification); ii) provide an accurate estimation of the clinical scale index, by computing its value through a function modelling based on energy computation. Preliminary results show that, as regards i), the OFF states were identified with an accuracy of around 98%, while ii) results are presented in terms of clustering robustness (silhouette coefficient of 0.82) and a paired t-test confirming the relation between quantitative computed index and clinical scores. These promising outcomes are opening the way for the development of algorithms able to analyse real-time data from wearable devices to assess disease progression in people with PD."

However, the cost-prohibitive nature of these invasive sensing systems precludes their usage in the large patient population affected by HF. The objective of this research is to estimate the changes in pulmonary artery mean pressure (PAM) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) following vasodilator infusion during right heart catheterization (RHC), using changes in simultaneously recorded wearable seismocardiogram (SCG) signals captured with a small wearable patch. Methods: A total of 20 patients with HF (20% women, median age 55 (interquartile range (IQR), 44-64) years, ejection fraction 24 (IQR, 16-43)) were fitted with a wearable sensing patch and underwent RHC with vasodilator challenge. We divided the dataset randomly into a training–testing set (n = 15) and a separate validation set (n = 5). We developed globalized (population) regression models to estimate changes in PAM and PCWP from the changes in simultaneously recorded SCG. Results: The regression model estimated both pressures with good accuracies: root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of 2.5 mmHg and R2 of 0.83 for estimating changes in PAM, and RMSE of 1.9 mmHg and R2 of 0.93 for estimating changes in PCWP for the training-testing set, and RMSE of 2.7 mmHg and R2 of 0.81 for estimating changes in PAM, and RMSE of 2.9 mmHg and R2 of 0.95 for estimating changes in PCWP for the validation set respectively. Conclusion: Changes in wearable SCG signals may be used to track acute changes in intracardiac hemodynamics in patients with HF. Significance: This method holds promise in tracking longitudinal changes in hemodynamic congestion in hemodynamically-guided remote home monitoring and treatment for patients with HF."

The automated intervention platform consists of a remote monitoring system that ingests lifestyle and blood pressure (BP) data and builds a personalized machine learning (ML) model to generate tailored lifestyle recommendations most relevant to each patient's BP. Lifestyle data is collected from a wearable device and questionnaire mobile app which includes activity, sleep, stress and diet information. BP data is remotely collected using at-home BP monitors. With this data, the system trains random forest models that predict BP from lifestyle features and uses Shapley Value analysis to estimate the impact of features on BP. Precise lifestyle recommendations are generated based on the top lifestyle factors for each patient. To test the system's ability to improve BP, we enrolled hypertensive patients into a three-armed clinical trial. During the 6-month trial period, our system provided weekly recommendations to patients in the experimental group. We evaluate the system's effectiveness based on multiple BP improvement metrics and comparison with a control group. Patients in the experimental group experienced an average BP change of −4.0 and −4.7 mmHg for systolic and diastolic BP, respectively, compared to −0.3 and −0.9 mmHg for the control group. Our results demonstrate that the platform can effectively help patients improve their BP through precise lifestyle recommendations."

Using three optical sensors with four light sources, WrisTee allows users to measure 12 photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals at three locations on the radial artery. Two types of PPG signals with opposite polarities were discovered and designated as in-phase and invert-phase signals. We provided a unified viewpoint regarding their differences based on the Beer $-$ Lambert law, and showed that both signals can be used for heart monitoring using data analyzed from a selected subject. Using reflective pulse-transition time (R-PTT) and the standard deviation of R-PTT ($\sigma _{R\text{-}PTT}$), we proposed a method for selecting the optimal wavelength to achieve the best quality signal, thus minimizing storage requirements, power resources, and computational costs. We conducted an experiment on ten subjects to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed method. Our results demonstrated that WrisTee is capable of finding the optimal positions and wavelengths for monitoring vital signs. To automatically detect the PPG phases, six machine learning (ML) models were explored to assess their accuracy for PPG-phase classification. The experimental results show that a convolutional neural network can be the best candidate for phase classification. Hence, it can be integrated into WrisTee for noninvasive health monitoring such as heart rate, heart rate variability, or blood pressure. Our work paves a new direction in bio-signal medical researches by adopting in-phase and invert-phase PPGs for healthcare monitoring."

Stultz,QTNet: Deep Learning for Estimating QT Intervals Using a Single Lead ECG,,"QT prolongation often leads to fatal arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. Antiarrhythmic drugs can increase the risk of QT prolongation and therefore require strict post-administration monitoring and dosage control. Measurement of the QT interval from the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) by a trained expert, in a clinical setting, is the accepted method for tracking QT prolongation. Recent advances in wearable ECG technology, however, raise the possibility of automated out-of-hospital QT tracking. Applications of Deep Learning (DL) - a subfield within Machine Learning - in ECG analysis holds the promise of automation for a variety of classification and regression tasks. In this work, we propose a residual neural network, QTNet, for the regression of QT intervals from a single lead (Lead-I) ECG. QTNet is trained in a supervised manner on a large ECG dataset from a U.S. hospital. We demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of QTNet on four test-sets; one from the same hospital, one from another U.S. hospital, and two public datasets. Over all four datasets, the mean absolute error (MAE) in the estimated QT interval ranges between 9ms and 15.8ms. Pearson correlation coefficients vary between 0.899 and 0.914. By contrast, QT interval estimation on these datasets with a standard method for automated ECG analysis (NeuroKit2) yields MAEs between 22.29ms and 90.79ms, and Pearson correlation coefficients 0.345 and 0.620. These results demonstrate the utility of QTNet across distinct datasets and patient populations, thereby highlighting the potential utility of DL models for ubiquitous QT tracking.Clinical Relevance— QTNet can be applied to inpatient or ambulatory Lead-I ECG signals to track QT intervals. The method facilitates ambulatory monitoring of patients at risk of QT prolongation."

The innovation of THE Raspberry Pi is used in conjunction with sensors that are implanted in textiles in order to gather data in real time about the internal temperature of wounds, the levels of wetness, and infection indicators. On the basis of this data, a training model is created in order to give forecasting insights into the consequences of wound healing. Applying an expansive dataset, which particularly displays the neural network's ability to distinguish unique healing patterns, is the method that is used to verify the correctness of the neural network. In addition to providing continuous monitoring, the wearable gadget also makes it simpler to recognize problems at an earlier stage in their development. The adaptability of smart materials and the capacity for forecasting of ANN have been combined in this one-of-a-kind technology, which provides a possible route for managing the management of healing wounds that is both customized and efficient."

Sarrafzadeh,A Self-supervised Framework for Improved Data-Driven Monitoring of Stress via Multi-Modal Passive Sensing,,"Recent advances in remote health monitoring systems have significantly benefited patients and played a crucial role in improving their quality of life. However, while physiological health-focused solutions have demonstrated increasing success and maturity, mental health-focused applications have seen comparatively limited success in spite of the fact that stress and anxiety disorders are among the most common issues people deal with in their daily lives. In the hopes of furthering progress in this domain through the development of a more robust analytic framework for the measurement of indicators of mental health, we propose a multi-modal semi-supervised framework for tracking physiological precursors of the stress response. Our methodology enables utilizing multi-modal data of differing domains and resolutions from wearable devices and leveraging them to map short-term episodes to semantically efficient embeddings for a given task. Additionally, we leverage an inter-modality contrastive objective, with the advantages of rendering our framework both modular and scalable. The focus on optimizing both local and global aspects of our embeddings via a hierarchical structure renders transferring knowledge and compatibility with other devices easier to achieve. In our pipeline, a task-specific pooling based on an attention mechanism, which estimates the contribution of each modality on an instance level, computes the final embeddings for observations. This additionally provides a thorough diagnostic insight into the data characteristics and highlights the importance of signals in the broader view of predicting episodes annotated per mental health status. We perform training experiments using a corpus of real-world data on perceived stress, and our results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in performance improvements."

Algarni,A Healthcare Monitoring System for the Diagnosis of Heart Disease in the IoMT Cloud Environment Using MSSO-ANFIS,,"The IoT has applications in many areas such as manufacturing, healthcare, and agriculture, to name a few. Recently, wearable devices have become popular with wide applications in the health monitoring system which has stimulated the growth of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). The IoMT has an important role to play in reducing the mortality rate by the early detection of disease. The prediction of heart disease is a key issue in the analysis of clinical dataset. The aim of the proposed investigation is to identify the key characteristics of heart disease prediction using machine learning techniques. Many studies have focused on heart disease diagnosis, but the accuracy of the findings is low. Therefore, to improve prediction accuracy, an IoMT framework for the diagnosis of heart disease using modified salp swarm optimization (MSSO) and an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is proposed. The proposed MSSO-ANFIS improves the search capability using the Levy flight algorithm. The regular learning process in ANFIS is dependent on gradient-based learning and has a tendency to become trapped in local minima. The learning parameters are optimized utilizing MSSO to provide better results for ANFIS. The following information is taken from medical records to predict the risk of heart disease: blood pressure (BP), age, sex, chest pain, cholesterol, blood sugar, etc. The heart condition is identified by classifying the received sensor data using MSSO-ANFIS. A simulation and analysis is conducted to show that MSSA-ANFIS works well in relation to disease prediction. The results of the simulation demonstrate that the MSSO-ANFIS prediction model achieves better accuracy than the other approaches. The proposed MSSO-ANFIS prediction model obtains an accuracy of 99.45 with a precision of 96.54, which is higher than the other approaches."

Ibrahim,A Novel Artificial Spider Monkey Based Random Forest Hybrid Framework for Monitoring and Predictive Diagnoses of Patients Healthcare,,"Early diagnosis of diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular, diabetes, HIV, AIDS, Lyme, and tuberculosis can enable timely treatment, which enhances efficacy and helps reduce the severity and mortality while lowering overall healthcare costs. Predictive analytics is an emerging approach that comprehends trends in patient data to identify patterns in patient data, detect subtle signs of diseases, and enable early diagnosis for more effective treatment. However, traditional predictive diagnosis approaches rely on statistical models that are contingent on the data’s average pattern and are unable to capture the data’s inherent patterns, leading to ineffective and inaccurate diagnoses. In this paper, we introduce a novel Artificial Spider Monkey-based Random Forest (ASM-RF) hybrid framework that combines the predictive analytics of a Random Forest algorithm with Artificial Intelligence to evaluate patient health data, spot patterns, diagnose modest indications, and automate intelligent decisions for enhancing the healthcare system. The proposed ASM-RF hybrid framework employs a fitness function to evaluate the spider monkey’s performance at the classification layer and update accuracy and recall, resulting in more accurate patient disease diagnoses and automating timely treatment decisions for improving the overall healthcare system. Moreover, we use Identity-based Encryption (IBE), which enables the encryption of data with private and public keys coupled with users’ identities as the encryption keys, assisting in enhancing the security of the healthcare system. A dataset collected from three different IoT sensor devices, ten participants, and twelve activities is employed to simulate the proposed ASM-RF hybrid framework, which is then contrasted to cutting-edge predictive diagnostic algorithms in terms of accuracy, precision, Area under the Curve, execution time, recall, and F-measure. The proposed method exhibits superior performance when compared to conventional methods, as evidenced by its exceptional accuracy (99.52%), precision (99.12%), Area Under the Curve (AUC) (99.00%), recall (99.22%), F-measure (97.12%), and significantly reduced execution time (6s)."

Pallotti,Classification-Based Screening of Phlebopathic Patients using Smart Socks,,"Telemedicine consists in the delivery of health care services, where patients and providers are separated by distance. Telemonitoring facilities play an important role in remote assistance programs, particularly in assisting patients suffering from chronic afflictions, such as phlebopathic diseases (e.g. chronic venous disease and diabetic foot). When these pathologies worsen, complications can be serious. In fact, foot deformities lead to variations of plantar load, formation of ulcers and, in the worst case, to amputation. Consequently, these pathologies cause huge expenses for the health care system. We propose a framework for screening and early detection of phlebopathic diseases insurgence, based on dynamic tests for functional assessment where patients wear sensorized socks. Socks used in this study integrate force and inertial sensors to provide information on plantar pressures and person's movement. We show results of a feasibility study including 42 patients, with a balance of 21 healthy patients and 21 with phlebopathic diseases. Data gathered from wearables were automatically elaborated through machine learning techniques in order to obtain a binary classifier identifying whether or not a patient shows pathological gait. Results show that our best classifier has high positive predictive value and high sensitivity, with F1-score equal to 92.1%."

Kim,MS-DLD: Multi-Sensors Based Daily Locomotion Detection via Kinematic-Static Energy and Body-Specific HMMs,,"More adaptable and user-independent techniques are required for multi-sensors based daily locomotion detection (MS-DLD). This research study proposes a couple of locomotion detection methods using body-worn multi-sensors to successfully categorize several locomotion transitions. This research presents both standard and state-of-the-art methods for MS-DLD. Conventionally, to improve MS-DLD process, the proposed methodology consists of a wavelet transformed Quaternion-based filter for the inertial signals, patterns recognition in the form of kinematic-static energies, and state-of-the-art multi-features extraction. These features include entropy, spectral, and cepstral coefficients domains. Then, fuzzy logic-based optimization has been introduced in order to achieve the selective features by converting them into codewords. These nominated features with enhanced patterns are further detected by HMMs to improve the accuracy for classifying daily life locomotion actions. This paper also introduces another state-of-the-art way to model daily locomotion detection and derives body-specific modified HMMs. The model divides the sensor data into three active body-specific parts including head sensors, mid-body sensors, and lower body sensors. Body-specific modified HMMs have been provided with raw data for the three active body-specific sensors and gave better results with less computational complexities when compared to the conventional methods. The proposed systems have been experimentally assessed and trialed over three diverse publicly available datasets: the UP-Fall dataset consisting of falling and other daily life activities, the IM-WSHA dataset comprising everyday locomotion actions, and the ENABL3S gait and locomotion dataset consisting of multiple gait movements. Experimental outcomes indicate that the proposed conventional technique achieved improved results and outperformed existing systems based on detection accuracies of 90.0% and 87.5% over UP-Fall, 86.0% and 88.3% over IM-WSHA, and 86.7% and 90.0% over ENABL3S datasets for kinematic and static energy patterns, respectively. Further, the results show that the state-of-the-art body-specific modified HMMs method achieved 94.3% and 95.0% over UP-Fall, 92.0% and 93.3% over IM-WSHA, and 90.0% and 95.0% over ENABL3S datasets for kinematic and static patterned signals, respectively. The results of state-of-the-art efficient system show a significant increase in detection accuracy when compared to standard systems."

Unfortunately, standard manual RR counting is prone to human error and cannot be performed continuously. This study proposes a method for continuously estimating RR, RRWaveNet. The method is a compact end-to-end deep learning model which does not require feature engineering and can use low-cost raw photoplethysmography (PPG) as input signal. RRWaveNet was tested subject-independently and compared to baseline in four data sets (BIDMC, CapnoBase, WESAD, and SensAI) and using three window sizes (16, 32, and 64 s). RRWaveNet outperformed current state-of-the-art methods with mean absolute errors at an optimal window size of 1.66 ± 1.01, 1.59 ± 1.08, 1.92 ± 0.96, and 1.23 ± 0.61 breaths per minute for each data set. In remote monitoring settings, such as in the WESAD and SensAI data sets, we apply transfer learning to improve the performance using two other ICU data sets as pretraining data sets, reducing the MAE by up to 21%. This shows that this model allows accurate and practical estimation of RR on affordable and wearable devices. Our study also shows feasibility of remote RR monitoring in the context of telemedicine and at home."

Such individuals require continuous monitoring to ensure the stability of their condition and prevent complications. However, traditional methods of patient monitoring can be invasive, time-consuming, and often result in patients feeling limited in their daily activities. The development of intelligent monitoring systems based on Internet of Things technologies has the potential to revolutionize the way chronic illness is managed. These systems can be integrated with wearable/portable devices and other sensors to track vital signs in real-time. This information can then be transmitted to healthcare providers for review, allowing for early detection of any changes or potential issues. The benefits of such systems are numerous. They provide patients with increased freedom and mobility, as they no longer need to visit a healthcare facility for regular check-ups. They also reduce the workload for healthcare providers, freeing up time for more critical cases. Furthermore, they can result in cost savings for healthcare systems by reducing the need for hospitalization. This work introduces the SMART CARE project that aims to develop an integrated monitoring system consisting of hardware and software components that can make the various phases of managing a patient with chronic heart failure (prevention, diagnosis, therapy, follow-up) more efficient. The paper provides the main information on the project and presents and describes the system architecture of the proposed solution."

In our previous work, we showed that transfer learning techniques like semi-supervised adversarial domain adaptation can help to achieve this. We applied our method to remote sleep monitoring, by performing sleep staging on single-channel wearable EEG signals. In this work, we propose data augmentation to help in tackling this challenge. By using an artificially increased amount of labeled data, our semi-supervised adversarial domain adaptation method improves its performance on the wearable EEG data. The accuracy is increased consistently by 0.6% to 1.4% relative to the results without augmentation. As both adversarial domain adaptation and data augmentation are strategies to deal with the scarceness of data, we conclude that these methods are can effectively be combined to surpass their individual performance."

As people get older, multimorbidity—the simultaneous occurrence of many chronic conditions becomes more common. Health systems around the world struggle to adapt to the great range of physical and mental abilities of older people and to encourage good trajectories of healthy aging from an early age. The abilities of an older person can change quickly—in some circumstances, over the course of hours. Care systems struggle to adapt rapidly enough to meet a person's changing demands. As a result of the impending lack of healthcare workers qualified to provide for senior citizens, adopting elder-friendly technologies may level the playing field in the industry. A decision support system can send alerts to elderly people, their family members, and carers, recommending the necessary interventions to halt further health deterioration, based on the statistically significant changes that can be found in daily records using a combination of modern data mining techniques. This study examines the most recent Internet of Things (IoT) technology can assist carers in improving the health, safety, and quality of life of independent elderly persons.

It has been shown that the risk factors of dementia are a mixture of pathological, lifestyle and heritable factors, with some of those being provably modifiable. Early diagnosis of dementia and approaches to slow down its evolution are currently the most prominent management methodologies due to lack of a cure. For that reason, a plethora of home-based assistive technologies for dementia management do exist, with most of them focusing on the improvement of memory and thinking. The main objective of LETHE is prevention in the whole spectrum of cognitive decline in the elderly population at risk reaching from asymptomatic to subjective or mild cognitive impairment to prodromal Dementia. LETHE will provide a Big Data collection platform and analysis system, that will allow prevention, personalized risk detection and intervention on cognitive decline. Through the subsequent 2-year clinical trial, the LETHE system, as well as the respective knowledge gained will be evaluated and validated. The scope of the current paper is to introduce the LETHE study and its respective novel platform as a holistic approach to multidomain lifestyle intervention trial studies. The present work depicts the architectural perspective and extends beyond state-of-the-art guidelines and approaches to health management systems and cloud platform development.Clinical Relevance — Patient Management Systems as well as lifestyle management platforms have significant clinical relevance as they allow for remote and continuous monitoring of patients' health status.

De Vos,Longitudinal Trend Monitoring of Multiple Sclerosis Ambulation Using Smartphones,,"Goal: Smartphone and wearable devices may act as powerful tools to remotely monitor physical function in people with neurodegenerative and autoimmune diseases from out-of-clinic environments. Detection of progression onset or worsening of symptoms is especially important in people living with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) in order to enable optimally adapted therapeutic strategies. MS symptoms typically follow subtle and fluctuating disease courses, patient-to-patient, and over time. Current in-clinic assessments are often too infrequently administered to reflect longitudinal changes in MS impairment that impact daily life. This work, therefore, explores how smartphones can administer daily two-minute walking assessments to monitor PwMS physical function at home. Methods: Remotely collected smartphone inertial sensor data was transformed through state-of-the-art Deep Convolutional Neural Networks, to estimate a participant's daily ambulatory-related disease severity, longitudinally over a 24-week study. Results: This study demonstrated that smartphone-based ambulatory severity outcomes could accurately estimate MS level of disability, as measured by the EDSS score ($r^{2}$: 0.56,$p< $0.001). Furthermore, longitudinal severity outcomes were shown to accurately reflect individual participants' level of disability over the study duration. Conclusion: Smartphone-based assessments, that can be performed by patients from their home environments, could greatly augment standard in-clinic outcomes for neurodegenerative diseases. The ability to understand the impact of disease on daily-life between clinical visits, through objective digital outcomes, paves the way forward to better measure and identify signs of disease progression that may be occurring out-of-clinic, to monitor how different patients respond to various treatments, and to ultimately enable the development of better, and more personalised care."

Being that MWSNs are highly susceptible to failures due to certain limitations, such as low energy resources, poor reliability, low computational resources, and considerable susceptibility to post-deployment security attacks, the proposed model is an anomaly detection method for MWSNs for the detection of anomalies in an adaptive manner with high accuracy while maintaining resource constraints using two phases. First, an anomaly-based detection model was created using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique to reduce dimensionality, prevent overfitting, and increase detection accuracy. Second, the detection accuracy of the proposed model was evaluated and compare before and after PCA integration. The experimental study showed that the proposed model can rapidly identify sensor anomalies with high accuracy."

Current diagnosis technologies misdiagnose one in four patients, relying on tests and technologies that are subjective to the administrating clinicians. Furthermore, they are inaccessible to billions due to immobility, geographic barriers, or associated costs. With early and accurate diagnosis being vital to effective treatment, a tremendous issue emerges. ParkinSense addresses these issues, serving as an automated web application that contactlessly analyzes three cardinal symptoms of Parkinson’s Disease over a standard webcam and microphone: Hypomimia, Dysarthria, and Bradykinesia. With Ensemble Learning coupled with various classifiers, ParkinSense was able to achieve an accuracy rate of 99.72% when tested on synthetic patients. By examining and combining multiple modalities, ParkinSense boasts accuracy rates higher than many advanced unimodal technologies, as patients often do not substantially display all the symptoms of Parkinson’s Disease, leading to misdiagnosis when relying on one symptom for diagnosis. Furthermore, ParkinSense is able to accurately estimate disease severity for positively diagnosed patients, with a Mean Absolute Error of 9.7 on the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale. ParkinSense strongly suggests that an entirely contactless diagnosis of Parkinson’s Disease through digital biomarkers can be effective, and web applications can be utilized for rapid, automated, and remote diagnosis and severity analysis, which can be crucial for those affected by barriers that prevent access to healthcare."

With recent advancements in quantum information and computation, quantum machine learning (QML) has emerged as a powerful tool capable of improving upon the measurement of PAEE. In this study, we propose a hybrid machine-learning model to predict PAEE.

Lee,Estimating Ground Reaction Force and Center of Pressure Using Low-Cost Wearable Devices,,"Objective: Ambulatory monitoring of ground reaction force (GRF) and center of pressure (CoP) could improve management of health conditions that impair mobility. Insoles instrumented with force-sensitive resistors (FSRs) are an unobtrusive, low-cost, and low-power technology for sampling GRF and CoP in real-world environments. However, FSRs have variable response characteristics that complicate estimation of GRF and CoP. This study introduces a unique data analytic pipeline that enables accurate estimation of GRF and CoP despite relatively inaccurate FSR responses. This paper also investigates whether inclusion of a complementary knee angle sensor improves estimation accuracy. Methods: Seventeen healthy subjects were equipped with an insole instrumented with six FSRs and a string-based knee angle sensor. Subjects walked in a straight line at self-selected slow, preferred, and fast speeds over an in-ground force platform. Twenty repetitions were performed for each speed. Supervised machine learning models estimated weight-normalized GRF and shoe size-normalized CoP, which were re-scaled to obtain GRF and CoP. Results: Anteroposterior GRF, Vertical GRF, and Anteroposterior CoP were estimated with a normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of less than 5%. Mediolateral GRF and CoP were estimated with an NRMSE of 8.1% and 6.4%, respectively. Knee angle-related features slightly improved GRF estimates. Conclusion: Normalized models accurately estimated GRF and CoP despite deficiencies in FSR data. Significance: Ambulatory use of the proposed system could enable objective, longitudinal monitoring of severity and progression for a variety of health conditions."

However, the accuracy of health parameter estimation is dependent on the quality of the signals collected and the algorithms used, which can be particularly challenging in the presence of environmental noise and motion artifacts. In this work, SeismoNet, a highly-sensitive, low-power, multi-node wireless wearable platform is introduced that enables recording of small amplitude acceleration signals (especially SCG signals) and ECG from multiple points on the human body. Using the SeismoNet, we performed a study involving 20 human participants with five nodes placed around the trunk, and showed that combining multiple nodes can improve the estimation performance of heart rate (HR) and respiration rate (RR) by approximately 30% and 23%, respectively. This suggests that combining acceleration data from multiple points on the body can enhance the cardiac and respiratory content of the acquired data, resulting in more accurate predictions. Furthermore, the SeismoNet platform and the dataset collected can be utilized to explore research questions related to multi-point physiological sensing."

Patra,Automated Myocardial Infarction Screening Using Morphology-Based Electrocardiogram Biomarkers,,"Ischemic heart disease (IHD), a critical and dreadful cardiovascular disease, is a leading cause of death globally. The steady progress of IHD leads to an irreversible condition called myocardial infarction (MI). The detection of MI can be done by observing the altered electrocardiogram (ECG) characteristics. Often, automated ECG analysis is preferred in place of visual inspection to reduce time and ensure reliable detection even when the recording quality is not very good. This paper presents an automated approach to classify recent MI, past MI, and normal sinus rhythm (NSR) classes based on the morphological features of the ECG. In clinical practice, a standard 12-lead ECG setup is typically employed to identify MI. However, acquiring a 12-lead ECG is not always convenient. Hence, in this study, we have explored the possibility of using a minimal number of ECG leads by deriving the augmented limb leads using leads I and II. A well-known and widely used ensemble machine learning tool, the random forest (RF) classifier is trained using features extracted from the derived augmented limb leads and their combinations. An RF classifier built using features extracted from all limb leads has outperformed classifiers built on combinations of them with five-fold cross-validation training accuracy of 97.9 (±0.008) % and testing accuracy of 98 %.Clinical relevance— As high sensitivity is reported in identifying recent MI and past MI classes, the proposed approach is suitable for preventative healthcare applications since it is less likely that subjects with recent or past MI will be misclassified. Due to its low computational complexity, better interpretability, and comparable performance to the state-of-the-art results, the proposed approach can be employed in clinical and cardiac health screening applications. It also has the potential to be employed in remote monitoring with mobile and wearable devices because it is built on features extracted from only lead I and II ECG recordings."

Even today, one has to wait until diseases have manifested before attempting to treat or cure them. And because the genetic and environmental components that contribute to major diseases like Cancer, Alzheimer’s and cardiovascular diseases are not fully understandable, our efforts to treat them are often haphazard, unpredictable, and inefficient. As a result, the drugs and therapies developed are evaluated on large groups of people and given based on statical averages. And because of the genetic variances, they function for some patients but not for others. Every prescription medicine now on the market only works for half of the people who take it. Based on each patient’s unique genetic composition and environment circumstances, personalized medicine is a critical milestone to be attained to address this issue. Artificial intelligence and blockchain have recently been innovations in the healthcare industry. Furthermore, blockchain can control patient data privacy among participants.

This raises privacy concerns and makes continuous data collection difficult and expensive due to the high cost of transferring data from a user’s wearable device to a central repository. Considering this, we explore the adoption of federated learning (FL) as a potential solution to address the privacy and cost issues associated with data collection in HAR. More specifically, we investigate the performance and behavioral differences between FL and deep learning (DL) HAR models, under various conditions relevant to real-world deployments. Namely, we explore the differences between the two types of models when (i) using data from different sensor placements, (ii) having access to users with data from heterogeneous sensor placements, (iii) considering bandwidth efficiency, and (iv) dealing with data with incorrect labels. Our results show that FL models suffer from a consistent performance deficit in comparison to their DL counterparts, but achieve these results with much better bandwidth efficiency. Furthermore, we observe that FL models exhibit very similar responses to those of DL models when exposed to data from heterogeneous sensor placements. Finally, we show that the FL models are more robust to data with incorrect labels than their centralized DL counterparts."

Huang,SMARTSeiz: Deep Learning With Attention Mechanism for Accurate Seizure Recognition in IoT Healthcare Devices,,"The Internet of Things (IoT) is capable of controlling the healthcare monitoring system for remote-based patients. Epilepsy, a chronic brain syndrome characterized by recurrent, unpredictable attacks, affects individuals of all ages. IoT-based seizure monitoring can greatly enhance seizure patients' quality of life. IoT device acquires patient data and transmits it to a computer program so that doctors can examine it. Currently, doctors invest significant manual effort in inspecting Electroencephalograph (EEG) signals to identify seizure activity. However, EEG-based seizure detection algorithms face challenges in real-world scenarios due to non-stationary EEG data and variable seizure patterns among patients and recording sessions. Therefore, a sophisticated computer-based approach is necessary to analyze complex EEG records. In this work, the authors proposed a hybrid approach by combining traditional convolution neural (CN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) along with an attention mechanism for the automatic recognition of epileptic seizures through EEG signal analysis. This attention mechanism focuses on significant subsets of EEG data for class recognition, resulting in improved model performance. The proposed methods are evaluated using a publicly available UCI epileptic seizure recognition dataset, which consists of five classes: four normal conditions and one abnormal seizure condition. Experimental results demonstrate that the suggested approach achieves an overall accuracy of 97.05% for the five-class EEG recognition data, with an accuracy of 99.52% for binary classification distinguishing seizure cases from normal instances. Furthermore, the proposed intelligent seizure recognition model is compatible with an IoMT (Internet of Medical Things) cloud-based smart healthcare framework."

Given the low ratio of patients to healthcare providers, it becomes infeasible to provide one-to-one support to patients. Furthermore the existing online medical consultation platforms are costly for regular approach. Addressing these issues, we propose to monitor and assist patients suffering from chronic disease using a novel Al-based and IoT-supported digital twin platform. A digital twin of a patient grows with the patient, and it helps in continuous and remote patient monitoring. Further, the digital twin enables the creation of patient-specific personalized treatment models, enabling doctors to conduct virtual simulations of the suitability of certain drugs and procedures. The data collected from the digital twin is fed to machine learning models for intelligent analysis, feedback, and support. The proposed solution incorporates five essential machine learning models using novel algorithms for drug recommendation, chronic disease stage detection, nutrition tracking and recommendation, patient activity tracking, and patient data anonymization. Addressing patients' lack of motivation to participate in emerging patient monitoring frameworks, we incorporate an incentive mechanism rooted in Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to encourage active participation in patients, which also has the added benefit of helping patients to store their historical medical data securely."

Bespoke subject-specific treatment (medication or deep brain stimulation (DBS)) is critical for management, yet depends on precise assessment cardinal PD symptoms - bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor. Clinician diagnosis is the basis of treatment, yet it allows only a cross-sectional assessment of symptoms which can vary on an hourly basis and is liable to inter- and intra-rater subjectivity across human examiners. Automated symptomatic assessment has attracted significant interest to optimise treatment regimens between clinician visits, however, no wearable has the capacity to simultaneously assess all three cardinal symptoms. Challenges in the measurement of rigidity, mapping muscle activity out-of-clinic and sensor fusion have inhibited translation. In this study, we address all through a novel wearable sensor system and machine learning algorithms. The sensor system is composed of a force-sensor, three inertial measurement units (IMUs) and four custom mechanomyography (MMG) sensors. The system was tested in its capacity to predict Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores based on quantitative assessment of bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor in PD patients. 23 PD patients were tested with the sensor system in parallel with exams conducted by treating clinicians and 10 healthy subjects were recruited as a comparison control group. Results prove the system accurately predicts UPDRS scores for all symptoms (85.4% match on average with physician assessment) and discriminates between healthy subjects and PD patients (96.6% on average). MMG features can also be used for remote monitoring of severity and fluctuations in PD symptoms out-of-clinic. This closed-loop feedback system enables individually tailored and regularly updated treatment, facilitating better outcomes for a very large patient population."

Incorporating semantics in scene understanding has led to a deep understanding of human-centric actions. Therefore, in this research work, we propose a semantic HOI recognition system based on multi-vision sensors. In the proposed system, the de-noised RGB and depth images, via Bilateral Filtering (BLF), are segmented into multiple clusters using a Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) algorithm. The skeleton is then extracted from segmented RGB and depth images via Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT). Human joints, extracted from the skeleton, provide the annotations for accurate pixel-level labeling. An elliptical human model is then generated via a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). A Conditional Random Field (CRF) model is trained to allocate a specific label to each pixel of different human body parts and an interaction object. Two semantic feature types that are extracted from each labeled body part of the human and labelled objects are: Fiducial points and 3D point cloud. Features descriptors are quantized using Fisher's Linear Discriminant Analysis (FLDA) and classified using K-ary Tree Hashing (KATH). In experimentation phase the recognition accuracy achieved with the Sports dataset is 92.88%, with the Sun Yat-Sen University (SYSU) 3D HOI dataset is 93.5% and with the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) RGB+D dataset it is 94.16%.

One of the key components of an ICU is the continuous monitoring of patients' vital parameters. However, existing advances in informatics, signal processing, or engineering that could alleviate the burden on ICUs have not yet been applied. This could be due to the lack of user involvement in research and development. OBJECTIVE: This study focused on the satisfaction of ICU staff with current patient monitoring and their suggestions for future improvements. We aimed to identify aspects of monitoring that interrupt patient care, display devices for remote monitoring, use cases for artificial intelligence (AI), and whether ICU staff members are willing to improve their digital literacy or contribute to the improvement of patient monitoring. We further aimed to identify differences in the responses of different professional groups. METHODS: This survey study was performed with ICU staff from 4 ICUs of a German university hospital between November 2019 and January 2020. We developed a web-based 36-item survey questionnaire, by analyzing a preceding qualitative interview study with ICU staff, about the clinical requirements of future patient monitoring. Statistical analyses of questionnaire results included median values with their bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals, and chi-square tests to compare the distributions of item responses of the professional groups. RESULTS: In total, 86 of the 270 ICU physicians and nurses completed the survey questionnaire. The majority stated they felt confident using the patient monitoring equipment, but that high rates of false-positive alarms and the many sensor cables interrupted patient care. Regarding future improvements, respondents asked for wireless sensors, a reduction in the number of false-positive alarms, and hospital standard operating procedures for alarm management. Responses to the display devices proposed for remote patient monitoring were divided. Most respondents indicated it would be useful for earlier alerting or when they were responsible for multiple wards. AI for ICUs would be useful for early detection of complications and an increased risk of mortality; in addition, the AI could propose guidelines for therapy and diagnostics. Transparency, interoperability, usability, and staff training were essential to promote the use of AI. The majority wanted to learn more about new technologies for the ICU and required more time for learning. Physicians had fewer reservations than nurses about AI-based intelligent alarm management and using mobile phones for remote monitoring. CONCLUSIONS: This survey study of ICU staff revealed key improvements for patient monitoring in intensive care medicine. Hospital providers and medical device manufacturers should focus on reducing false alarms, implementing hospital alarm standard operating procedures, introducing wireless sensors, preparing for the use of AI, and enhancing the digital literacy of ICU staff. Our results may contribute to the user-centered transfer of digital technologies into practice to alleviate challenges in intensive care medicine.

The objective of this study was to determine the accuracy of noninvasive remote monitoring in predicting HF rehospitalization. METHODS: The LINK-HF study (Multisensor Non-invasive Remote Monitoring for Prediction of Heart Failure Exacerbation) examined the performance of a personalized analytical platform using continuous data streams to predict rehospitalization after HF admission. Study subjects were monitored for up to 3 months using a disposable multisensor patch placed on the chest that recorded physiological data. Data were uploaded continuously via smartphone to a cloud analytics platform. Machine learning was used to design a prognostic algorithm to detect HF exacerbation. Clinical events were formally adjudicated. RESULTS: One hundred subjects aged 68.4±10.2 years (98% male) were enrolled. After discharge, the analytical platform derived a personalized baseline model of expected physiological values. Differences between baseline model estimated vital signs and actual monitored values were used to trigger a clinical alert. There were 35 unplanned nontrauma hospitalization events, including 24 worsening HF events. The platform was able to detect precursors of hospitalization for HF exacerbation with 76% to 88% sensitivity and 85% specificity. Median time between initial alert and readmission was 6.5 (4.2-13.7) days. CONCLUSIONS: Multivariate physiological telemetry from a wearable sensor can provide accurate early detection of impending rehospitalization with a predictive accuracy comparable to implanted devices. The clinical efficacy and generalizability of this low-cost noninvasive approach to rehospitalization mitigation should be further tested. Registration: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

Yet, treatment of at-risk patients with various O3FA formulations has produced disparate results in large, well-controlled and well-conducted clinical trials. Prescription formulations and fish oil supplements containing low-dose mixtures of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) have routinely failed to prevent CV events in primary and secondary prevention settings when added to contemporary care, as shown most recently in the STRENGTH and OMEMI trials. However, as observed in JELIS, REDUCE-IT, and RESPECT-EPA, EPA-only formulations significantly reduce CVD events in high-risk patients. The CV mechanism of action of EPA, while certainly multifaceted, does not depend solely on reductions of circulating lipids, including triglycerides (TG) and LDL, and event reduction appears related to achieved EPA levels suggesting that the particular chemical and biological properties of EPA, as compared to DHA and other O3FAs, may contribute to its distinct clinical efficacy. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown different effects of EPA compared with DHA alone or EPA/DHA combination treatments, on atherosclerotic plaque morphology, LDL and membrane oxidation, cholesterol distribution, membrane lipid dynamics, glucose homeostasis, endothelial function, and downstream lipid metabolite function. These findings indicate that prescription-grade, EPA-only formulations provide greater benefit than other O3FAs formulations tested. This review summarizes the clinical findings associated with various O3FA formulations, their efficacy in treating CV disease, and their underlying mechanisms of action."

The increasing prevalence of HF and inpatient HF hospitalization has a considerable burden on healthcare cost and utilization. The recognition that hemodynamic changes in pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and left atrial pressure precede the signs and symptoms of HF has led to interest in hemodynamic guided HF therapy as an approach to allow earlier intervention during a heart failure decompensation. Remote patient monitoring (RPM) utilizing telecommunication, cardiac implantable electronic device parameters and implantable hemodynamic monitors (IHM) have largely failed to demonstrate favorable outcomes in multicenter trials. However, one positive randomized clinical trial testing the CardioMEMS device (followed by Food and Drug Administration approval) has generated renewed interest in PAP monitoring in the HF population to decrease hospitalization and improve quality of life. The COVID-19 pandemic has also stirred a resurgence in the utilization of telehealth to which RPM using IHM may be complementary. The cost effectiveness of these monitors continues to be a matter of debate. Future iterations of devices aim to be smaller, less burdensome for the patient, less dependent on patient compliance, and less cumbersome for health care providers with the integration of artificial intelligence coupled with sophisticated data management and interpretation tools. Currently, use of IHM may be considered in advanced heart failure patients with the support of structured programs."

There is an increase in research for advanced AI techniques, such as deep learning, to build predictive models for the early detection of diseases. Such predictive models leverage mobile health (mHealth) data from wearable sensors and smartphones to discover novel ways for detecting and managing chronic diseases and mental health conditions. OBJECTIVE: Currently, little is known about the use of AI-powered mHealth (AIM) settings. Therefore, this scoping review aims to map current research on the emerging use of AIM for managing diseases and promoting health. Our objective is to synthesize research in AIM models that have increasingly been used for health care delivery in the last 2 years. METHODS: Using Arksey and O'Malley's 5-point framework for conducting scoping reviews, we reviewed AIM literature from the past 2 years in the fields of biomedical technology, AI, and information systems. We searched 3 databases, PubsOnline at INFORMS, e-journal archive at MIS Quarterly, and Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Digital Library using keywords such as ""mobile healthcare,"" ""wearable medical sensors,"" ""smartphones"", and ""AI."" We included AIM articles and excluded technical articles focused only on AI models. We also used the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) technique for identifying articles that represent a comprehensive view of current research in the AIM domain. RESULTS: We screened 108 articles focusing on developing AIM models for ensuring better health care delivery, detecting diseases early, and diagnosing chronic health conditions, and 37 articles were eligible for inclusion, with 31 of the 37 articles being published last year (76%). Of the included articles, 9 studied AI models to detect serious mental health issues, such as depression and suicidal tendencies, and chronic health conditions, such as sleep apnea and diabetes. Several articles discussed the application of AIM models for remote patient monitoring and disease management. The considered primary health concerns belonged to 3 categories: mental health, physical health, and health promotion and wellness. Moreover, 14 of the 37 articles used AIM applications to research physical health, representing 38% of the total studies. Finally, 28 out of the 37 (76%) studies used proprietary data sets rather than public data sets. We found a lack of research in addressing chronic mental health issues and a lack of publicly available data sets for AIM research. CONCLUSIONS: The application of AIM models for disease detection and management is a growing research domain. These models provide accurate predictions for enabling preventive care on a broader scale in the health care domain. Given the ever-increasing need for remote disease management during the pandemic, recent AI techniques, such as federated learning and explainable AI, can act as a catalyst for increasing the adoption of AIM and enabling secure data sharing across the health care industry."

Existing feature-based models for signal cleaning can be limited as they might not capture the full signal characteristics.Approach.In this work we present a deep learning framework for sensor signal cleaning based on dilated convolutions which capture the coarse- and fine-grained structure in order to classify whether a signal is noisy or clean. However, since obtaining annotated physiological data is costly and time-consuming we propose an autoencoder-based semi-supervised model which is able to learn a representation of the sensor signal characteristics, also adding an element of interpretability.Main results.Our proposed models are over 8% more accurate than existing feature-based approaches with half the false positive/negative rates. Finally, we show that with careful tuning (that can be improved further), the semi-supervised model outperforms supervised approaches suggesting that incorporating the large amounts of available unlabeled data can be advantageous for achieving high accuracy (over 90%) and minimizing the false positive/negative rates.Significance.Our approach enables us to reliably separate clean from noisy physiological sensor signal that can pave the development of reliable features and eventually support decisions regarding drug efficacy in clinical trials."
2024 Mar,Pharmaceutical medicine,10.1007/s40290-024-00515-0 [doi],Hügle T,Advancing Rheumatology Care Through Machine Learning.,New Zealand,"Rheumatologic diseases are marked by their complexity, involving immune-, metabolic- and mechanically mediated processes which can affect different organ systems. Despite a growing arsenal of targeted medications, many rheumatology patients fail to achieve full remission. Assessing disease activity remains challenging, as patients prioritize different symptoms and disease phenotypes vary. This is also reflected in clinical trials where the efficacy of drugs is not necessarily measured in an optimal way with the traditional outcome assessment. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has catalyzed a digital transformation in healthcare, embracing telemonitoring and patient-reported data via apps and wearables. As a further driver of digital medicine, electronic medical record (EMR) providers are actively engaged in developing algorithms for clinical decision support, heralding a shift towards patient-centered, decentralized care. Machine learning algorithms have emerged as valuable tools for handling the increasing volume of patient data, promising to enhance treatment quality and patient well-being. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are particularly promising for radiological image analysis, aiding in the detection of specific lesions such as erosions, sacroiliitis, or osteoarthritis, with several FDA-approved applications. Clinical predictions, including numerical disease activity forecasts and medication choices, offer the potential to optimize treatment strategies. Numeric predictions can be integrated into clinical workflows, allowing for shared decision making with patients. Clustering patients based on disease characteristics provides a personalized care approach. Digital biomarkers, such as patient-reported outcomes and wearables data, offer insights into disease progression and therapy response more flexibly and outside patient consultations. In association with patient-reported outcomes, disease-specific digital biomarkers via image recognition or single-camera motion capture enables more efficient remote patient monitoring. Digital biomarkers may also play a major role in clinical trials in the future as continuous, disease-specific outcome measurement facilitating decentralized studies. Prediction models can help with patient selection in clinical trials, such as by predicting high disease activity. Efforts are underway to integrate these advancements into clinical workflows using digital pathways and remote patient monitoring platforms. In summary, machine learning, digital biomarkers, and advanced imaging technologies hold immense promise for enhancing clinical decision support and clinical trials in rheumatology. Effective integration will require a multidisciplinary approach and continued validation through prospective studies."

As history taking and physical examination continue to rely on long-established practices, a growing pipeline of AI-enhanced digital tools may soon augment the traditional clinical encounter into a data-driven process. This article presents an evidence-backed vision of how promising AI applications may enhance traditional practices, streamlining tedious tasks while elevating diverse data sources, including AI-enabled stethoscopes, cameras, and wearable sensors, to platforms for personalized medicine and efficient care delivery. Through the lens of traditional patient evaluation, we illustrate how digital technologies may soon be interwoven into routine clinical workflows, introducing a novel paradigm of longitudinal monitoring. Finally, we provide a skeptic's view on the practical, ethical, and regulatory challenges that limit the uptake of such technologies."

Four Epilog sensors are combined as part of Epitel's Remote EEG Monitoring platform (REMI) to create 10 channels of EEG for remote patient monitoring. REMI is designed to provide comprehensive spatial EEG recordings that can be administered by non-specialized medical personnel in any medical center. The purpose of this study was to determine how accurate epileptologists are at remotely reviewing Epilog sensor EEG in the 10-channel ""REMI montage,"" with and without seizure detection support software. Three board certified epileptologists reviewed the REMI montage from 20 subjects who wore four Epilog sensors for up to 5 days alongside traditional video-EEG in the EMU, 10 of whom experienced a total of 24 focal-onset electrographic seizures and 10 of whom experienced no seizures or epileptiform activity. Epileptologists randomly reviewed the same datasets with and without clinical decision support annotations from an automated seizure detection algorithm tuned to be highly sensitive. Blinded consensus review of unannotated Epilog EEG in the REMI montage detected people who were experiencing electrographic seizure activity with 90% sensitivity and 90% specificity. Consensus detection of individual focal onset seizures resulted in a mean sensitivity of 61%, precision of 80%, and false detection rate (FDR) of 0.002 false positives per hour (FP/h) of data. With algorithm seizure detection annotations, the consensus review mean sensitivity improved to 68% with a slight increase in FDR (0.005 FP/h). As seizure detection software, the automated algorithm detected people who were experiencing electrographic seizure activity with 100% sensitivity and 70% specificity, and detected individual focal onset seizures with a mean sensitivity of 90% and mean false alarm rate of 0.087 FP/h. This is the first study showing epileptologists' ability to blindly review EEG from four Epilog sensors in the REMI montage, and the results demonstrate the clinical potential to accurately identify patients experiencing electrographic seizures. Additionally, the automated algorithm shows promise as clinical decision support software to detect discrete electrographic seizures in individual records as accurately as FDA-cleared predicates."

We introduce the current BP measurement techniques with their underlying operating principles. New promising proof-of-concept studies are presented and recent modeling and machine learning approaches for improved BP estimation are summarized. This aids discussions on how new BP monitors should evaluated in order to bring forth new home monitoring solutions in wearable form factor. Finally, we discuss on unresolved challenges in making convenient, reliable and validated BP monitoring solutions."

This paper presents a flexible wearable acceleration sensor for monitoring human motion by introducing the island-bridge configuration and serpentine interconnects. Compared with traditional wearable accelerometers, the flexible accelerometer proposed in this paper improves the wearing comfort while reducing the cost of the device. Simulation and experiments under bending, stretching, and torsion conditions demonstrate that the flexible performance of the flexible acceleration sensor can meet the needs of monitoring the daily movement of the human body, and it can work normally under various conditions. The measurement accuracy of the flexible acceleration sensor is verified by comparing it with the data of the commercial acceleration sensor. The flexible acceleration sensor can measure the acceleration and the angular velocity of the human body with six degrees of freedom and recognize the gesture and motion features according to the acceleration characteristics. The presented flexible accelerometers provide great potential in recognizing the motion features that are critical for healthcare monitoring and physical sports performance evaluation."

STUDY SELECTIONS: Studies that addressed the keywords were included and narrowed down based on their applicability in the allergy and immunology clinic. RESULTS: There has been rapid innovation in the digital health care space with expansion of electronic medical record services and the patient portal, creation of allergy and immunology-specific medical devices and applications with remote patient monitoring capabilities, and website and artificial intelligence development to interact with patients. CONCLUSION: These technological advances provide distinct advantages to the provider and patient but also have a burden of time for evaluation of the data for the provider and disparate access to certain technologies for patients. The development of these technologies has been fast-tracked since the start of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. With the explosion in telehealth and medical device development, advancement of medical technology is not revealing any signs of slowing down.

This review covers the application of digital health in heart failure patients, focusing on teleconsultation, remote monitoring and apps and wearables, looking at how these technologies can be used to support care and improve outcomes. Interest in and use of these technologies, particularly teleconsultation, have been accelerated by the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Remote monitoring of heart failure patients, to identify those patients at high risk of hospitalisation and to support clinical stability, has been studied with mixed results. Remote monitoring of pulmonary artery pressure has a consistent effect on reducing hospitalisation rates for patients with moderately severe symptoms and multiparameter monitoring shows promise for the future. Wearable devices and apps are increasingly used by patients for health and lifestyle support. Some wearable technologies have shown promise in AF detection, and others may be useful in supporting self-care and guiding prognosis, but more evidence is required to guide their optimal use. Support for patients and clinicians wishing to use these technologies is important, along with consideration of data validity and privacy and appropriate recording of decision-making."

The poor reliability of self-reported seizure diaries for many people with epilepsy is well-established, but these records remain necessary in clinical care and therapeutic studies. A number of wearable devices have emerged, which may be capable of detecting seizures, recording seizure data, and alerting caregivers. Developments in non-invasive wearable sensors to measure accelerometry, photoplethysmography (PPG), electrodermal activity (EDA), electromyography (EMG), and other signals outside of the traditional clinical environment may be able to identify seizure-related changes. Non-invasive scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and minimally invasive subscalp EEG may allow direct measurement of seizure activity. However, significant network and computational infrastructure is needed for continuous, secure transmission of data. The large volume of data acquired by these devices necessitates computer-assisted review and detection to reduce the burden on human reviewers. Furthermore, user acceptability of such devices must be a paramount consideration to ensure adherence with long-term device use. Such devices can identify tonic-clonic seizures, but identification of other seizure semiologies with non-EEG wearables is an ongoing challenge. Identification of electrographic seizures with subscalp EEG systems has recently been demonstrated over long (>6 month) durations, and this shows promise for accurate, objective seizure records. While the ability to detect and forecast seizures from ambulatory intracranial EEG is established, invasive devices may not be acceptable for many individuals with epilepsy. Recent studies show promising results for probabilistic forecasts of seizure risk from long-term wearable devices and electronic diaries of self-reported seizures. There may also be predictive value in individuals' symptoms, mood, and cognitive performance. However, seizure forecasting requires perpetual use of a device for monitoring, increasing the importance of the system's acceptability to users. Furthermore, long-term studies with concurrent EEG confirmation are lacking currently. This review describes the current evidence and challenges in the use of minimally and non-invasive devices for long-term epilepsy monitoring, the essential components in remote monitoring systems, and explores the feasibility to detect and forecast impending seizures via long-term use of these systems."

In the last two years, there was an important development of studies that focused on opportunities, perspectives, and problems in this field. The topic is very important because the telemedicine and AI applied to dermatology have the opportunity to improve both the quality of healthcare for citizens and the workflow of healthcare professionals. This study conducted an overview on the opportunities, the perspectives, and the problems related to the integration of TD with AI. The methodology of this review, following a standardized checklist, was based on: (I) a search of PubMed and Scopus and (II) an eligibility assessment, using parameters with five levels of score. The outcome highlighted that applications of this integration have been identified in various skin pathologies and in quality control, both in eHealth and mHealth. Many of these applications are based on Apps used by citizens in mHealth for self-care with new opportunities but also open questions. A generalized enthusiasm has been registered regarding the opportunities and general perspectives on improving the quality of care, optimizing the healthcare processes, minimizing costs, reducing the stress in the healthcare facilities, and in making citizens, now at the center, more satisfied.

The FDA regulates AI in medical devices and aims to ensure patient safety, effectiveness, and transparent AI solutions. OBJECTIVES: Identify and summarize FDA approved RPM devices to provide information for the US medical device industry based on previous approvals and the markets' needs. METHODS: We searched publicly available databases on FDA-approved RPM devices. Selection criteria were established to classify a solution as AI. Technical information was analyzed on pre-identified 16 parameters for the qualified solutions. RESULTS: A total of 47 RPM devices were reviewed, among which 12.8% were classified as a De Novo product and the remaining devices fell under the 510(K) FDA category. The cardiovascular (74%) AI RPM solutions dominated the US market, followed by ECG-based arrhythmia detection algorithms (59.4%), and Hemodynamics and Vital Sign monitoring algorithms (21.9%). The trend observed in the FDA rejected devices was their inability to be classified into clinically relevant categories (Criteria 2 and 3). CONCLUSION: The market needs more innovative RPM solutions under the De Novo category, as there are very few. The transparency is low on the technical aspect of AI algorithms. The market needs AI algorithms that can effectively classify patients rather than merely improve device functionality."

In particular, first, the soft transducer measures hypertension-related vitals (heart rate, oxygen saturation and systolic/diastolic pressure) and sends the data to a remote database (which can be easily consulted both by the patient and the physician). In addition to this, a dedicated deep learning algorithm, based on a Long-Short-Term-Memory Autoencoder, was designed, implemented and tested for providing an alert when the patient's vitals exceed certain thresholds, which are automatically personalized for the specific patient. Furthermore, a mobile application (EcO2u) was developed to manage the entire data flow and facilitate the data fruition; this application also implements an innovative face-detection algorithm that ensures the identity of the patient. The robustness of the proposed soft transducer was validated experimentally on five individuals, who used the system for 30 days.

Besides this, the conceptualized global responses to these crises are still inadequate and entail drastic changes. Therefore, more sophisticated monitoring and conservation techniques are required which can simultaneously cover a larger surface area within a stipulated time frame and gather a large pool of data. Hence, this study is an overview of remote monitoring methods in biodiversity conservation via a survey of evidence-based reviews and related studies, wherein the description of the application of some technology for biodiversity conservation and monitoring is highlighted.

In the intraoperative period, technology will lead to the development of integrated monitoring systems that will integrate multiple data streams and allow anesthesiologists to track patients more effectively. This will free up anesthesiologists to focus on more complex tasks, such as managing risk and making value-based decisions. This will also enable the continued integration of remote monitoring and control towers having profound effects on coverage and practice models. In the PACU and ICU, the technology will lead to the development of early warning systems that can identify patients who are at risk of complications, enabling early interventions and more proactive care. The integration of augmented reality will allow for better integration of diverse types of data and better decision-making. Postoperatively, the proliferation of wearable devices that can monitor patient vital signs and track their progress will allow patients to be discharged from the hospital sooner and receive care at home.

AREAS COVERED: Four main emerging areas of application were identified and synthesized, namely, mobile health solutions (specifically, for the assessment of frailty, risk of falls, chronic neurological diseases, and for the monitoring and promotion of active living), occupational ergonomics, rehabilitation and telerehabilitation, and cognitive assessment. Findings from recent scientific literature in each of these areas was synthesized from an applied and/or clinical perspective with the purpose of providing clinical researchers and practitioners with practical guidance on contemporary uses of inertial sensors in applied clinical settings. EXPERT OPINION: IMU-based wearable devices have undergone a rapid transition from use in laboratory-based clinical practice to unsupervised, applied settings. Successful use of wearable inertial sensing for assessing mobility, motor performance and movement disorders in applied settings will rely also on machine learning algorithms for managing the vast amounts of data generated by these sensors for extracting information that is both clinically relevant and interpretable by practitioners."

Exacerbations can be triggered by environmental exposures, changes in lifestyle, and/or physiological and psychological factors to greater or lesser extents depending on the individual's COPD phenotype. The prediction and early detection of an exacerbation might allow patients and physicians to better manage the acute phase. We summarize the recent scientific data on remote telemonitoring (TM) for the prediction and management of acute exacerbations in COPD patients. We discuss the components of remote monitoring platforms, including the integration of environmental monitoring data; patient reported outcomes collected via interactive Smartphone apps, with data from wearable devices that monitor physical activity, heart rate, etc.; and data from medical devices such as connected non-invasive ventilators. We consider how telemonitoring and the deluge of data it potentially generates could be combined with electronic health records to provide personalized care and multi-disease management for COPD patients."

Since then, the development of artificial intelligence has in part been shaped by the field of neuroscience. By understanding the human brain, scientists have attempted to build new intelligent machines capable of performing complex tasks akin to humans. Indeed, future research into artificial intelligence will continue to benefit from the study of the human brain. While the development of artificial intelligence algorithms has been fast paced, the actual use of most artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in biomedical engineering and clinical practice is still markedly below its conceivably broader potentials. This is partly because for any algorithm to be incorporated into existing workflows it has to stand the test of scientific validation, clinical and personal utility, application context, and is equitable as well. In this context, there is much to be gained by combining AI and human intelligence (HI). Harnessing Big Data, computing power and storage capacities, and addressing societal issues emergent from algorithm applications, demand deploying HI in tandem with AI. Very few countries, even economically developed states, lack adequate and critical governance frames to best understand and steer the AI innovation trajectories in health care. Drug discovery and translational pharmaceutical research stand to gain from AI technology provided they are also informed by HI. In this expert review, we analyze the ways in which AI applications are likely to traverse the continuum of life from birth to death, and encompassing not only humans but also all animal, plant, and other living organisms that are increasingly touched by AI. Examples of AI applications include digital health, diagnosis of diseases in newborns, remote monitoring of health by smart devices, real-time Big Data analytics for prompt diagnosis of heart attacks, and facial analysis software with consequences on civil liberties. While we underscore the need for integration of AI and HI, we note that AI technology does not have to replace medical specialists or scientists and rather, is in need of such expert HI. Altogether, AI and HI offer synergy for responsible innovation and veritable prospects for improving health care from prevention to diagnosis to therapeutics while unintended consequences of automation emergent from AI and algorithms should be borne in mind on scientific cultures, work force, and society at large."

Most existing VOC sensors use semiconductors, optics, and electrochemistry, which are only capable of measuring the total concentration of VOCs with slow response, resulting in the lack of selectivity and low efficiency for VOC detection. Infrared (IR) spectroscopy technology provides an effective solution to detect chemical structures of VOC molecules by absorption fingerprints induced by the signature vibration of chemical stretches. However, traditional IR spectroscopy for VOC detection is limited by the weak light-matter interaction, resulting in large optical paths. Leveraging the ultrahigh electric field induced by plasma, the vibration of the molecules is enhanced to improve the light-matter interaction. Herein, we report a plasma-enhanced IR absorption spectroscopy with advantages of fast response, accurate quantization, and good selectivity. An order of ∼kV voltage was achieved from the multiswitched manipulation of the triboelectric nanogenerator by repeated sliding. The VOC species and their concentrations were well-quantified from the wavelength and intensity of spectra signals with the enhancement from plasma. Furthermore, machine learning has visualized the relationship of different VOCs in the mixture, which demonstrated the feasibility of the VOC identification to mimic patients."

The IoT and AI enabled smart systems can play a key role in driving the future of smart healthcare. Remote monitoring of critical and non-critical patients is one such field which can leverage the benefits of IoT and machine learning techniques. While some work has been done in developing paradigms to establish effective and reliable communications, there is still great potential to utilize optimized IoT network and machine learning technique to improve the overall performance of the communication systems, thus enabling fool-proof systems. This study develops a novel IoT framework to offer ultra-reliable low latency communications to monitor post-surgery patients. The work considers both critical and non-critical patients and is balanced between these to offer optimal performance for the desired outcomes. In addition, machine learning based regression analysis of patients' sensory data is performed to obtain highly accurate predictions of the patients' sensory data (patients' vitals), which enables highly accurate virtual observers to predict the data in case of communication failures. The performance analysis of the proposed IoT based vital signs monitoring system for the post-surgery patients offers reduced delay and packet loss in comparison to IEEE low latency deterministic networks. The gradient boosting regression analysis also gives a highly accurate prediction for slow as well as rapidly varying sensors for vital sign monitoring."

Innovative, practical strategies to improve monitoring of glycemic health are desperately needed. In this proof-of-concept study, we explore the relationship between non-invasive wearables and glycemic metrics and demonstrate the feasibility of using non-invasive wearables to estimate glycemic metrics, including hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and glucose variability metrics. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We recorded over 25 000 measurements from a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) with simultaneous wrist-worn wearable (skin temperature, electrodermal activity, heart rate, and accelerometry sensors) data over 8-10 days in 16 participants with normal glycemic state and pre-diabetes (HbA1c 5.2-6.4). We used data from the wearable to develop machine learning models to predict HbA1c recorded on day 0 and glucose variability calculated from the CGM. We tested the accuracy of the HbA1c model on a retrospective, external validation cohort of 10 additional participants and compared results against CGM-based HbA1c estimation models. RESULTS: A total of 250 days of data from 26 participants were collected. Out of the 27 models of glucose variability metrics that we developed using non-invasive wearables, 11 of the models achieved high accuracy (<10% mean average per cent error, MAPE). Our HbA1c estimation model using non-invasive wearables data achieved MAPE of 5.1% on an external validation cohort. The ranking of wearable sensor's importance in estimating HbA1c was skin temperature (33%), electrodermal activity (28%), accelerometry (25%), and heart rate (14%). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the feasibility of using non-invasive wearables to estimate glucose variability metrics and HbA1c for glycemic monitoring and investigates the relationship between non-invasive wearables and the glycemic metrics of glucose variability and HbA1c. The methods used in this study can be used to inform future studies confirming the results of this proof-of-concept study."

Regarding self-monitoring, wearable activity trackers allow automated passive data collection that educate and motivate patients. Wearing an activity tracker can improve walking time by around 1500 steps per day. However, there are concerns about measurement accuracy (e.g., lack of a common validation protocol or measurement discrepancies between different devices). For external monitoring, many innovative electronic tools are currently used in rheumatology to help support physician time management, to reduce the burden on clinic time, and to prioritize patients who may need further attention. In inflammatory arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis, regular monitoring of patients to detect disease flares improves outcomes. In a pilot study applying machine learning to activity tracker steps, we showed that physical activity was strongly linked to disease flares and that patterns of physical activity could be used to predict flares with great accuracy, with a sensitivity and specificity above 95%. Thus, automatic monitoring of steps may lead to improved disease control through potential early identification of disease flares. However, activity trackers have some limitations when applied to rheumatic patients, such as tracker adherence, lack of clarity on long-term effectiveness, or the potential multiplicity of trackers."

The aim of this review is to address emerging challenges that came to light during the pandemic in health care and innovations that enabled us to adapt and continue to care for patients. The pandemic highlighted the need for seismic shifts in care paradigms and technology with considerations related to the digital divide and health literacy for digital health interventions to reach full potential and improve health outcomes. We discuss advances in telemedicine, remote patient monitoring, and emerging wearable technologies. Despite the promise of digital health, we emphasise the importance of addressing its limitations, including interpretation challenges, accuracy of findings, and artificial intelligence-driven algorithms. We summarise the most recent recommendation of the Virtual Care Task Force to scaling virtual medical services in Canada.

In the setting of limited healthcare resources, outpatient management of individuals newly diagnosed with COVID-19 was commonly implemented, some taking advantage of various personal health technologies, but only rarely using a multi-parameter chest-patch for continuous monitoring. Here we describe the development and validation of a COVID-19 decompensation index (CDI) model based on chest patch-derived continuous sensor data to predict COVID-19 hospitalizations in outpatient-managed COVID-19 positive individuals, achieving an overall AUC of the ROC Curve of 0.84 on 308 event negative participants, and 22 event positive participants, out of an overall study cohort of 400 participants. We retrospectively compare the performance of CDI to standard of care modalities, finding that the machine learning model outperforms the standard of care modalities in terms of both numbers of events identified and with a lower false alarm rate. While only a pilot phase study, the CDI represents a promising application of machine learning within a continuous remote patient monitoring system."

Important subtopics of eHealth are health data sharing and telemedicine. Most of the clinical documentation to be shared is collected in patient records to support patient care. More sophisticated approaches to electronic patient records are trans-institutional or (inter-)national. Other aims for clinical documentation are quality management, reimbursement, legal issues, and medical research. Basic prerequisite for eHealth is interoperability, which can be divided into technical, semantic and process interoperability. There is a variety of international standards to support interoperability. Telemedicine is a subtopic of eHealth, which bridges spatial distance by using ICT for medical (inter-)actions. We distinguish telemedicine among healthcare professionals and telemedicine between health care professionals and patients. Both have a great potential to face the challenges of aging societies, the increasing number of chronically ill patients, multimorbidity and low number of physicians in remote areas. With ongoing digitalization more and more data are available digitally. Clinical documentation is an important source for big data analysis and artificial intelligence.

More than 3 million measurements were collected including heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, cardiac output, cardiac index, systemic vascular resistance, respiratory rate, blood oxygen saturation, and body temperature. Cardiovascular deterioration appeared early after admission and in parallel with changes in the respiratory parameters, showing a significant difference in trajectories within sub-populations at high risk. Early detection of cardiovascular deterioration of COVID-19 patients is achievable when using frequent remote patient monitoring."

However, challenges arise from the unregulated use of these devices, including questionable data reliability, potential misinterpretation of information, unintended psychological impacts, and an influx of clinically nonactionable data that may overburden the health care system. Further, these technologies could exacerbate, rather than mitigate, health disparities. Experience with wearables in atrial fibrillation underscores these challenges. The prevalent use of D2C wearables necessitates a collaborative approach among stakeholders to ensure effective integration into cardiovascular care.

RECENT FINDINGS: Digital technologies are increasingly used by healthcare professionals and those living with heart failure to support more personalised and timely shared decision-making, earlier identification of problems, and an improved experience of care. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the acceptability and implementation of a range of digital technologies, including remote monitoring and health tracking, mobile health (wearable technology and smartphone-based applications), and the use of machine learning to augment data interpretation and decision-making. Much has been learned over recent decades on the challenges and opportunities of technology development, including how best to evaluate the impact of digital health interventions on health and healthcare, the human factors involved in implementation and how best to integrate dataflows into the clinical pathway. Supporting patients with heart failure as well as healthcare professionals (both with a broad range of health and digital literacy skills) is crucial to success.

The lessons learned from the soft launch are used to modify and fine-tune the workflow process and study protocol. METHODS: This soft launch was conducted at NorthShore University HealthSystem's Evanston Hospital from December 2020 to March 2021. Patients were provided with non-invasive wearable biosensors that continuously collect ambulatory physiological data, and a study phone that collects patient-reported outcomes. The physiological data are analyzed by machine learning algorithms, potentially identifying physiological perturbation in HF patients. Alerts from this algorithm may be cascaded with other patient status data to inform home health nurses' (HHNs') management via a structured protocol. HHNs review the monitoring platform daily. If the patient's status meets specific criteria, HHNs perform assessments and escalate patient cases to the HF team for further guidance on early intervention. RESULTS: We enrolled five patients into the soft launch. Four participants adhered to study activities. Two out of five patients were readmitted, one due to HF, one due to infection. Observed miscommunication and protocol gaps were noted for protocol amendment. The study team adopted an organizational development method from change management theory to reconfigure the study protocol. CONCLUSION: We sought to automate the monitoring aspects of post-discharge care by aligning a new technology that generates streaming data from a wearable device with a complex, multi-provider workflow into a novel protocol using iterative design, implementation, and evaluation methods to monitor post-discharge HF patients. CRPM with structured escalation and telemonitoring protocol shows potential to maintain patients in their home environment and reduce HF-related readmissions. Our results suggest that further education to engage and empower frontline workers using advanced technology is essential to scale up the approach."

To decrease the amount of communication loss as well as the amount of time required to wait before detection and improve detection quality, the designed wearable device is also operated with a multi-objective framework. Additionally, a design method for wearable IoT devices is established, utilizing distinct mathematical approaches to solve these objectives. As a result, the monitored parametric values are saved in a different IoT application platform. Since the proposed study focuses on a multi-objective framework, state design and deep learning (DL) optimization techniques are combined, reducing the complexity of detection in wearable technology. Wearable devices with IoT processes have even been included in current methods. However, a solution cannot be duplicated using mathematical approaches and optimization strategies. Therefore, developed wearable gadgets can be applied to real-time medical applications for fast remote monitoring of an individual. Additionally, the proposed technique is tested in real-time, and an IoT simulation tool is utilized to track the compared experimental results under five different situations. In all of the case studies that were examined, the planned method performs better than the current state-of-the-art methods."

2023 Sep,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.45075 [doi] e45075,Talukdar D; De Deus LF; Sehgal N,The Evaluation of Remote Monitoring Technology Across Participants With Different Skin Tones.,United States,"BACKGROUND: Many research studies seek to improve vital sign monitoring to enhance the conditions under which doctors and caregivers track patients' health. Non-invasive and contactless monitoring has emerged as an optimal solution for this problem, with telemedicine, self-monitoring, and well-being tools being the next generation of technology in the biomedical field. However, there is worldwide concern about the general purpose and bias toward a certain demographic group of these techniques. In particular, skin tone and the accuracy of monitoring dark skin tone groups have been key questions among researchers, with the lack of results and studies contributing to this uncertainty. METHODS: This paper proposes a benchmark for remote monitoring solutions against a medical device across different skin tone people. Around 330 videos from 90 patients were analyzed, and heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) were compared across different subgroups. The Fitzpatrick scale (1-6) was used to classify participants into three skin tone groups: 1 and 2, 3 and 4, and 5 and 6. RESULTS: The results showed that our proposed methodology could estimate heart rate with a mean absolute error of 3 bpm across all samples and subgroups. Moreover, for heart rate variability (HRV) metrics, we achieved the following results: in terms of mobility assistive equipment (MAE), the HRV-inter-beat interval (IBI) was 10 ms, the HRV-standard deviation of normal to normal heartbeats (SDNN) was 14 ms, and the HRV-root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) between normal heartbeats was 22 ms. No significant performance decrease was found for any skin tone group, and there was no error trend toward a certain group. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that our methodology meets acceptable agreement levels for the proposed metrics. Furthermore, the experiments showed that skin tone did not impact the results, which remained within the same range across all groups. Moreover, it enables the end users to understand their general well-being and improve their overall health."

Data collected from mHealth applications, for example, on sensor devices carried by patients, can be mined and analyzed using artificial intelligence-based solutions to facilitate remote and (near) real-time decision-making in health care settings. However, such data often sit in data silos, and patients are often concerned about the privacy implications of sharing their raw data. Federated learning (FL) is a potential solution, as it allows multiple data owners to collaboratively train a machine learning model without requiring access to each other's raw data. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this scoping review is to gain an understanding of FL and its potential in dealing with sensitive and heterogeneous data in mHealth applications. Through this review, various stakeholders, such as health care providers, practitioners, and policy makers, can gain insight into the limitations and challenges associated with using FL in mHealth and make informed decisions when considering implementing FL-based solutions. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review following the guidelines of PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews). We searched 7 commonly used databases. The included studies were analyzed and summarized to identify the possible real-world applications and associated challenges of using FL in mHealth settings. RESULTS: A total of 1095 articles were retrieved during the database search, and 26 articles that met the inclusion criteria were included in the review. The analysis of these articles revealed 2 main application areas for FL in mHealth, that is, remote monitoring and diagnostic and treatment support. More specifically, FL was found to be commonly used for monitoring self-care ability, health status, and disease progression, as well as in diagnosis and treatment support of diseases. The review also identified several challenges (eg, expensive communication, statistical heterogeneity, and system heterogeneity) and potential solutions (eg, compression schemes, model personalization, and active sampling). CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review has highlighted the potential of FL as a privacy-preserving approach in mHealth applications and identified the technical limitations associated with its use. The challenges and opportunities outlined in this review can inform the research agenda for future studies in this field, to overcome these limitations and further advance the use of FL in mHealth."

Early diagnosis and treatment of SCC are essential to improve outcomes. Here we report a deep learning model-derived SCC-Score to detect and predict SCC from time-series data recorded continuously by a medical wearable. In this single-arm, single-center, observational cohort study, vital signs and physical activity were recorded with a wearable for 31,234 h in 79 patients (54 Inpatient Cohort (IC)/25 Outpatient Cohort (OC)). Hours with normal physical functioning without evidence of SCC (regular hours) were presented to a deep neural network that was trained by a self-supervised contrastive learning objective to extract features from the time series that are typical in regular periods. The model was used to calculate a SCC-Score that measures the dissimilarity to regular features. Detection and prediction performance of the SCC-Score was compared to clinical documentation of SCC (AUROC ± SD). In total 124 clinically documented SCC occurred in the IC, 16 in the OC. Detection of SCC was achieved in the IC with a sensitivity of 79.7% and specificity of 87.9%, with AUROC of 0.91 ± 0.01 (OC sensitivity 77.4%, specificity 81.8%, AUROC 0.87 ± 0.02). Prediction of infectious SCC was possible up to 2 days before clinical diagnosis (AUROC 0.90 at -24 h and 0.88 at -48 h). We provide proof of principle for the detection and prediction of SCC in patients treated for hematological malignancies using wearable data and a deep learning model. As a consequence, remote patient monitoring may enable pre-emptive complication management."

Digital technology can be of great help in this contest, thanks to remote monitoring, made possible with the use of wearable or implantable instruments. The latter are currently generally inserted inside defibrillators or resynchronization systems, or inserted inside the pulmonary circulation for monitoring pulmonary pressure. Parameters such as thoracic impedance, physical activity, heart rate variability, atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, blood pressure, and O(2) saturation can be controlled remotely. The data relating to the actual benefit in terms of avoidable events (death and hospitalizations) are not definitive, but certainly from an organizational point of view, the benefit is evident, both on the part of the patient and of the organization of care. The latter, provided in the form of televisits, requires a re-modulation of the system, making use of trained personnel, a well-structured network, and digital technologies (platforms, electronic health records) that are not yet perfectly developed. The evolution of the solutions offered by artificial intelligence guarantees a rapid and progressive refinement of telemedicine in this sector."

Acoustic techniques such as sonar and ultrasound sensors are also used for consumer applications, such as ranging and in vivo medical/healthcare applications. It has been of long-term interest to doctors and clinical practitioners to realize continuous healthcare monitoring in hospitals and/or homes. Physiological and biopotential signals in real-time serve as important health indicators to predict and prevent serious illness. Emerging electromagnetic-acoustic (EMA) sensing techniques synergistically combine the merits of EM sensing with acoustic imaging to achieve comprehensive detection of physiological and biopotential signals. Further, EMA enables complementary fusion sensing for challenging healthcare settings, such as real-world long-term monitoring of treatment effects at home or in remote environments. This article reviews various examples of EMA sensing instruments, including implementation, performance, and application from the perspectives of circuits to systems. The novel and significant applications to healthcare are discussed.

The Ag/MXene-Poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogel displayed integrated merits of highly strain sensitive (GF = 3.26), self-healing (within 10 min, 91% healing efficiency), and excellent antibacterial activity. The hydrogel could be assembled into a wearable skin-like sensor to monitor human movement, including large deformations (finger, elbow, wrist, and knee bending) and tiny deformations (mouth's movement and throat vocalization) in real time. Therefore, this work shed a new light on the development of flexible wearable skin-like sensors for the personalized healthcare monitoring, human-machine interfaces, and artificial intelligence."

If the HT is diagnosed early, effective treatment can control the BP and avert adverse outcomes. Physiological signals like electrocardiography (ECG), photoplethysmography (PPG), heart rate variability (HRV), and ballistocardiography (BCG) can be used to monitor health status but are not directly correlated with BP measurements. The manual detection of HT using these physiological signals is time consuming and prone to human errors. Hence, many computer-aided diagnosis systems have been developed. This paper is a systematic review of studies conducted on the automated detection of HT using ECG, HRV, PPG and BCG signals. In this review, we have identified 23 studies out of 250 screened papers, which fulfilled our eligibility criteria. Details of the study methods, physiological signal studied, database used, various nonlinear techniques employed, feature extraction, and diagnostic performance parameters are discussed. The machine learning and deep learning based methods based on ECG and HRV signals have yielded the best performance and can be used for the development of computer-aided diagnosis of HT. This work provides insights that may be useful for the development of wearable for continuous cuffless remote monitoring of BP based on ECG and HRV signals."

This research aims to learn and report about the current state of user activities, in real-time, in a specially designed private indoor environment with sensors in infection transmission control of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, a real-time learning system that evolves and updates with each incoming piece of data from the environment is developed to predict user activities categorized for remote monitoring. Accordingly, various experiments are conducted in the private indoor space. Multiple sensors, with their inputs, are analyzed through the experiments. The experiment environment, installed with microgrids and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, has provided correlating data of various sensors from that special care context during the pandemic. The data is applied to classify user activities and develop a real-time learning and monitoring system to predict the IoT data. The microgrids were operated with the real-time learning system developed by comprehensive experiments on classification learning, regression learning, Error-Correcting Output Codes (ECOC), and deep learning models. With the help of machine learning experiments, data optimization, and the multilayered-tandem organization of the developed neural networks, the efficiency of this real-time monitoring system increases in learning the activity of users and predicting their actions, which are reported as feedback on the monitoring interfaces.

This method is subject to human error and cannot provide continuous remote monitoring. Continuous monitoring using wearable sensors may provide a more comprehensive assessment of lower-limb muscular function. In this work, we propose an algorithm to classify stair climbing periods and estimate SCP from a lower-back worn accelerometer, which strongly agrees with the clinical standard (r = 0.92, p < 0.001; ICC = 0.90, [0.82, 0.94]). Data were collected in-lab from healthy adults (n = 65) performing the four-step SCPT and a walking assessment while instrumented (accelerometer + gyroscope), which allowed us to investigate tradeoffs between sensor modalities. Using two classifiers, we were able to identify periods of stair ascent with >89% accuracy [sensitivity = >0.89, specificity = >0.90] using two ensemble machine learning algorithms, trained on accelerometer signal features. Minimal changes in model performances were observed using the gyroscope alone (±0−6% accuracy) versus the accelerometer model. While we observed a slight increase in accuracy when combining gyroscope and accelerometer (about +3−6% accuracy), this is tolerable to preserve battery life in the at-home environment. This work is impactful as it shows potential for an accelerometer-based at-home assessment of SCP."

The Internet of Things (IoT) has recently drawn much interest as a potential remote health monitoring remedy. IoT-based systems can gather and analyze a wide range of physiological data, including blood oxygen levels, heart rates, body temperatures, and ECG signals, and then provide real-time feedback to medical professionals so they may take appropriate action. This paper proposes an IoT-based system for remote monitoring and early detection of health problems in home clinical settings. The system comprises three sensor types: MAX30100 for measuring blood oxygen level and heart rate; AD8232 ECG sensor module for ECG signal data; and MLX90614 non-contact infrared sensor for body temperature. The collected data is transmitted to a server using the MQTT protocol. A pre-trained deep learning model based on a convolutional neural network with an attention layer is used on the server to classify potential diseases. The system can detect five different categories of heartbeats: Normal Beat, Supraventricular premature beat, Premature ventricular contraction, Fusion of ventricular, and Unclassifiable beat from ECG sensor data and fever or non-fever from body temperature. Furthermore, the system provides a report on the patient's heart rate and oxygen level, indicating whether they are within normal ranges or not. The system automatically connects the user to the nearest doctor for further diagnosis if any critical abnormalities are detected."

Here, we aim to evaluate TILs as a percentage electronic TIL score (eTILs) and investigate its prognostic and predictive relevance in cutaneous melanoma. METHODS: We included stage I to IV cutaneous melanoma patients and used hematoxylin-eosin-stained slides for TIL analysis. We assessed eTILs as a continuous and categorical variable using the published cut-off of 16.6% and applied Cox regression models to evaluate associations of eTILs with relapse-free, distant metastasis-free, and overall survival. We compared eTILs of the primaries with matched metastasis. Moreover, we assessed the predictive relevance of eTILs in therapy-naïve metastases according to the first-line therapy. FINDINGS: We analysed 321 primary cutaneous melanomas and 191 metastatic samples. In simple Cox regression, tumour thickness (p < 0.0001), presence of ulceration (p = 0.0001) and eTILs ≤16.6% (p = 0.0012) were found to be significant unfavourable prognostic factors for RFS. In multiple Cox regression, eTILs ≤16.6% (p = 0.0161) remained significant and downgraded the current staging. Lower eTILs in the primary tissue was associated with unfavourable relapse-free (p = 0.0014) and distant metastasis-free survival (p = 0.0056). In multiple Cox regression adjusted for tumour thickness and ulceration, eTILs as continuous remained significant (p = 0.019). When comparing TILs in primary tissue and corresponding metastasis of the same patient, eTILs in metastases was lower than in primary melanomas (p < 0.0001). In therapy-naïve metastases, an eTILs >12.2% was associated with longer progression-free survival (p = 0.037) and melanoma-specific survival (p = 0.0038) in patients treated with anti-PD-1-based immunotherapy. In multiple Cox regression, lactate dehydrogenase (p < 0.0001) and eTILs ≤12.2% (p = 0.0130) were significantly associated with unfavourable melanoma-specific survival. INTERPRETATION: Assessment of TILs is prognostic in primary melanoma samples, and the eTILs complements staging. In therapy-naïve metastases, eTILs ≤12.2% is predictive of unfavourable survival outcomes in patients receiving anti-PD-1-based therapy.

It manifests with motor, cognitive and other types of symptoms, decreasing significantly the patients' quality of life. The recent advances in the Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence fields, including the subdomains of machine learning and deep learning, can support Parkinson's disease patients, their caregivers and clinicians at every stage of the disease, maximizing the treatment effectiveness and minimizing the respective healthcare costs at the same time. In this review, the considered studies propose machine learning models, trained on data acquired via smart devices, wearable or non-wearable sensors and other Internet of Things technologies, to provide predictions or estimations regarding Parkinson's disease aspects. Seven hundred and seventy studies have been retrieved from three dominant academic literature databases. Finally, one hundred and twelve of them have been selected in a systematic way and have been considered in the state-of-the-art systematic review presented in this paper. These studies propose various methods, applied on various sensory data to address different Parkinson's disease-related problems. The most widely deployed sensors, the most commonly addressed problems and the best performing algorithms are highlighted. Finally, some challenges are summarized along with some future considerations and opportunities that arise."

In this research, we present a machine learning (ML)-based remote monitoring method to estimate patient recovery from COVID-19 symptoms using automatically collected wearable device data, instead of relying on manually collected symptom data. We deploy our remote monitoring system, namely eCOVID, in two COVID-19 telemedicine clinics. Our system utilizes a Garmin wearable and symptom tracker mobile app for data collection. The data consists of vitals, lifestyle, and symptom information which is fused into an online report for clinicians to review. Symptom data collected via our mobile app is used to label the recovery status of each patient daily. We propose a ML-based binary patient recovery classifier which uses wearable data to estimate whether a patient has recovered from COVID-19 symptoms. We evaluate our method using leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation, and find that Random Forest (RF) is the top performing model. Our method achieves an F1-score of 0.88 when applying our RF-based model personalization technique using weighted bootstrap aggregation. Our results demonstrate that ML-assisted remote monitoring using automatically collected wearable data can supplement or be used in place of manual daily symptom tracking which relies on patient compliance."

Rehabilitation restores function, maintaining independence for longer. However, the poor availability and accessibility of rehabilitation limits its clinical impact. Artificial Intelligence (AI) guided interventions have improved many domains of healthcare, but whether rehabilitation can benefit from AI remains unclear. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of AI-supported physical rehabilitation technology tested in the clinical setting to understand: 1) availability of AI-supported physical rehabilitation technology; 2) its clinical effect; 3) and the barriers and facilitators to implementation. We searched in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Science Citation Index (Web of Science), CIRRIE (now NARIC), and OpenGrey. RESULTS: We identified 9054 articles and included 28 projects. AI solutions spanned five categories: App-based systems, robotic devices that replace function, robotic devices that restore function, gaming systems and wearables. We identified five randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which evaluated outcomes relating to physical function, activity, pain, and health-related quality of life. The clinical effects were inconsistent. Implementation barriers included technology literacy, reliability, and user fatigue. Enablers included greater access to rehabilitation programmes, remote monitoring of progress, reduction in manpower requirements and lower cost. CONCLUSION: Application of AI in physical rehabilitation is a growing field, but clinical effects have yet to be studied rigorously. Developers must strive to conduct robust clinical evaluations in the real-world setting and appraise post implementation experiences."

Of particular promise is the capacity of DHTs to autonomously facilitate remote monitoring and treatment. Diabetic Foot Ulcers (DFUs) are characterised by high rates of infection, amputation, mortality, and healthcare costs. With clinical outcomes contingent on activities that can be readily monitored, DFUs present a promising focus for the application of remote DHTs. OBJECTIVE: This scoping review has been conducted as a first step toward ascertaining fthe data-related challenges and opportunities for the development of more comprehensive, integrated, and individualised sense/act DHTs. We review the latest developments in the application of DHTs to the remote care of DFUs. We cover the types of DHTs in development and their features, technological readiness, and scope of clinical testing. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Only peer-reviewed original experimental and observational studies, case series and qualitative studies were included in literature searches. All reviews and manuscripts presenting pre-trial prototype technologies were excluded. METHODS: An initial search of three databases (Web of Science, MEDLINE, and Scopus) generated 1,925 English-language papers for screening. 388 papers were assessed as eligible for full-text screening by the review team. 81 manuscripts were found to meet the eligibility criteria. RESULTS: Only 19% of studies incorporated multiple DHTs. We categorised 56% of studies as 'Treatment-Manual', i.e. studies involving technologies aimed at treatment requiring manual data generation, and 26% as 'Prevention-Autonomous', i.e. studies of technologies generating data autonomously through wearable sensors aimed at ulcer prevention through patient behavioural change. Only 10% of studies involved more ambitious 'Treatment-Autonomous' interventions. We found that studies generally reported high levels of patient adherence and satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings point to a major potential role for DHTs in remote personalised medical management of DFUs. However, larger studies are required to assess their impact. Here, we see opportunities for developing much larger, more comprehensive, and integrated monitoring and decision support systems with the potential to address the disease in a more complete context by capturing and integrating data from multiple sources from subjective and objective measurements."

From fall detection to remotely monitoring behavioral patterns, vital functions and collection of air quality data, AAL has become pervasive in the modern era of independent living for the elderly section of the population. However, even with the current rate of progress, data access and data reliability has become a major hurdle especially when such data is intended to be used in new age modelling approaches such as those using machine learning. This paper presents a comprehensive data ecosystem comprising remote monitoring AAL sensors along with extensive focus on cloud native system architecture, secured and confidential access to data with easy data sharing. Results from a validation study illustrate the feasibility of using this system for remote healthcare surveillance. The proposed system shows great promise in multiple fields from various AAL studies to development of data driven policies by local governments in promoting healthy lifestyles for the elderly alongside a common data repository that can be beneficial to other research communities worldwide.Clinical Relevance- This study creates a cloud-based smart home data ecosystem, which can achieve the remote healthcare monitoring for aging population, enabling them to live more independently and decreasing hospital admission rates."

An ideal intelligent air filtration system should possess reliable filtration efficiency, low pressure drop, healthcare monitoring function, and man-machine interactive capability. However, no existing intelligent protection system covers all these essential aspects. Herein, we developed an intelligent wearable filtration system (IWFS) via advanced nanotechnology and machine learning. Based on the triboelectric mechanism, the fabricated IWFS exhibits a long-lasting high particle filtration efficiency and bacteria protection efficiency of 99% and 100%, respectively, with a low-pressure drop of 5.8 mmH(2)O. Correspondingly, the charge accumulation of the optimized IWFS (87 nC) increased to 3.5 times that of the pristine nanomesh, providing a significant enhancement of the particle filtration efficiency. Theoretical principles, including the enhancement of the β-phase and the lower surface potential of the modified nanomesh, were quantitatively investigated by molecular dynamics simulation, band theory, and Kelvin probe force microscopy. Furthermore, we endowed the IWFS with a healthcare monitoring function and man-machine interactive capability through machine learning and wireless transmission technology. Crucial physiological signals of people, including breath, cough, and speaking signals, were detected and classified, with a high recognition rate of 92%; the fabricated IWFS can collect healthcare data and transmit voice commands in real time without hindrance by portable electronic devices. The achieved IWFS not only has practical significance for human health management but also has great theoretical value for advanced wearable systems."

Everyone is talking about it, but only a few know what it is or how it works. One can look at the Metaverse as a 3D model of the Internet where it is possible to spend your reality parallel to the virtual world. In broad terms, Metaverse can be explained as a virtual space, graphically rich, leaning towards verisimilitude where people can do all sorts of things they do in real-life such as shop, play, socialize, and party. The pandemic has accelerated innovations in the digital age. Looking beyond revolutions in telehealth, payments, remote monitoring, and secure data-sharing are other essential innovations in the fields of artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and blockchain technology. The Metaverse is still in its nascent stage and evolving continuously, having a huge potential in health care to combine the technologies of AI, AR/VR, web 3.0, Internet of medical devices, and quantum computing, along with robotics to give a new direction to healthcare systems.

Other relevant signals, such as roll angle, inclination or a round kick evaluation, cannot be measured with them. This work proposes an alternative cadence-measurement system with less of the mentioned restrictions, without the need for distinct cadence-measurement apparatus attached to the pedal and shaft of the road bicycle. The proposed design applies an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to the seating pole of the bike. In an experiment, the motion data were gathered. A total of four different road cyclists participated in this study to collect different datasets for neural network training and evaluation. In total, over 10 h of road cycling data were recorded and used to train the neural network. The network's aim was to detect each revolution of the crank within the data. The evaluation of the data has shown that using pure accelerometer data from all three axes led to the best result in combination with the proposed network architecture. A working proof of concept was achieved with an accuracy of approximately 95% on test data. As the proof of concept can also be seen as a new method for measuring cadence, the method was compared with the ground truth. Comparing the ground truth and the predicted cadence, it can be stated that for the relevant range of 50 rpm and above, the prediction over-predicts the cadence with approximately 0.9 rpm with a standard deviation of 2.05 rpm. The results indicate that the proposed design is fully functioning and can be seen as an alternative method to detect the cadence of a road cyclist."

Conventional PF assessment tools have however limited feasibility for remote patient monitoring applications. To improve the safety of PF assessment, we previously developed and validated a quick and safe PF screening tool called Frailty Meter (FM). FM works by quantifying weakness, slowness, rigidity, and exhaustion during a 20-second repetitive elbow flexion/extension task using a wrist-worn sensor and generates a frailty index (FI) ranging from zero to one; higher values indicate progressively greater severity of frailty. However, the use of wrist-sensor limits its applications in telemedicine and remote patient monitoring. In this study, we developed a sensor-less FM based on deep learning-based image processing, which can be easily integrated into mobile health and enables remote assessment of physical frailty. The sensor-less FM extracts kinematic features of the forearm motion from the video of 20-second elbow flexion and extension recorded by a tablet camera, and then calculates frailty phenotypes and FI. To test the validity of sensor-less FM, 11 COPD patients admitted to a Telehealth pulmonary rehabilitation clinic and 10 healthy young volunteers (controls) were recruited. All participants completed the test indicating high feasibility. Strong correlations (0.72 < r < 0.99) were observed between the sensor-based FM and sensor-less FM to extract all frailty phenotypes and FI. After adjusting with age and body mass index(BMI), sensor-less FM enables distinguishing COPD group from controls (p<0.050) with the largest effect sizes observed for weakness (Cohen's effect size d=2.24), frailty index (d=1.70), and slowness (d=1.70). These pilot findings suggest feasibility and proof of concept validity of this sensor-less FM toward remote assessment of PF in COPD patients."

This makes remote monitoring and ambulatory cardiac rehabilitation (CR) therapy challenging. Current wearable multimodal devices enable remote monitoring. Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) can help in tackling multifaceted datasets. However, for clinical acceptance, easy interpretability of the AI models is crucial. The goal of the present study was to investigate whether a multi-parameter sensor could be used during a standardized activity test to interpret functional capacity in the longitudinal follow-up of CR patients. A total of 129 patients were followed for 3 months during CR using 6-min walking tests (6MWT) equipped with a wearable ECG and accelerometer device. Functional capacity was assessed based on 6MWT distance (6MWD). Linear and nonlinear interpretable models were explored to predict 6MWD. The t-distributed stochastic neighboring embedding (t-SNE) technique was exploited to embed and visualize high dimensional data. The performance of support vector machine (SVM) models, combining different features and using different kernel types, to predict functional capacity was evaluated. The SVM model, using chronotropic response and effort as input features, showed a mean absolute error of 42.8 m (±36.8 m). The 3D-maps derived using the t-SNE technique visualized the relationship between sensor-derived biomarkers and functional capacity, which enables tracking of the evolution of patients throughout the CR program. The current study showed that wearable monitoring combined with interpretable ML can objectively track clinical progression in a CR population. These results pave the road towards ambulatory CR."

The final aim of this paper was to develop ML methods for estimating blood pressure (BP) in a non-invasive way that is suitable in a telemedicine health-care monitoring context. The training of regression models useful for estimating systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was conducted using new extracted features from PPG signals processed using the Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform (MODWT). As a matter of fact, the interest was on the use of the most significant features obtained by the Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (MRMR) selection algorithm to train eXtreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost) and Neural Network (NN) models. This aim was satisfactorily achieved by also comparing it with works in the literature; in fact, it was found that XGBoost models are more accurate than NN models in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements, obtaining a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for SBP and DBP, respectively, of 5.67 mmHg and 3.95 mmHg. For SBP measurement, this result is an improvement compared to that reported in the literature. Furthermore, the trained XGBoost regression model fulfills the requirements of the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) as well as grade A of the British Hypertension Society (BHS) standard."

Taking into account recent situation with COVID-19 pandemics, digital technologies allowed to improve management of viral infections via remote monitoring and diagnostics of infected patients. Up to date, various mobile health applications (apps) have been proposed, including apps for the patients diagnosed with cardiovascular pathologies. OBJECTIVE: The presented review aimed at the analyses of a range of mHealth solutions used to improve primary cardiac care. In addition, we studied the factors driving and hindering the wide introduction of mHealth services in the clinics. METHODS: The work was based on the guidelines of the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. The publication search was carried out using PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases. Studies published during the period from 2014 until January 2022 were selected for the analysis. The evaluation of risk of bias for the included studies was conducted using the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias tool. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: An overall 5513 studies were assessed for eligibility after which 39 studies were included.. The main trend in the mobile health for cardiological applications is the use of different types of wearable devices and Artificial Intelligence-platforms. In fact, mobile technology allows remotely to monitor, interpret, and analyze biomedical data collected from the patient. CONCLUSION: The results of this literature search demonstrated that patients diagnosed with cardiovascular disorders can potentially benefit from the application of mHealth in cardiology. However, despite the proven advantages of mHealth for cardiology, there are many challenges and concerns regarding effectiveness, safety, reliability and the lack of official regulation and guidelines from official organizations. Such issues require solutions and further work towards a wide implementation of mHealth technologies in cardiac practice."

Techniques for recognizing simple and single activities are typical for now, but recognizing complex activities such as concurrent and interleaving activity is still a major challenging issue. In this paper, we propose a two-phase hybrid deep machine learning approach using bi-directional Long-Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) and Skip-Chain Conditional random field (SCCRF) to recognize the complex activity. BiLSTM is a sequential generative deep learning inherited from Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). SCCRFs is a distinctive feature of conditional random field (CRF) that can represent long term dependencies. In the first phase of the proposed approach, we recognized the concurrent activities using the BiLSTM technique, and in the second phase, SCCRF identifies the interleaved activity. Accuracy of the proposed framework against the counterpart state-of-art methods using the publicly available datasets in a smart home environment is analyzed. Our experiment's result surpasses the previously proposed approaches with an average accuracy of more than 93%."

MXene is regarded as one of the most ideal candidate sensing materials due to its high electrical conductivity and controllable interlayer space. However, the easy-to-oxidize characteristic of MXene materials greatly restricts the sensitivity and reliability of sensor devices, especially in wet climates. Herein, a highly sensitive and waterproof flexible pressure sensor using a free-standing hydrophobic bacterial cellulose/Ti(3)C(2)T(x) MXene (HBT) hybrid film as a sensing layer is fabricated by facile and effective nanocellulose intercalation and fluorine modification strategies. The obtained pressure sensor delivers high sensitivity (65.5 kPa(-1)), fast response (50 ms), wide linear sensing range (0.002-30 kPa) with a low detection limit of 0.57 Pa, and excellent repeatability over 50,000 cycles. Meanwhile, owing to the highly hydrophobic surface of the HTB film, the outstanding sensing features could be well retained, although immersed in water several times. Benefiting from the excellent sensing properties and water resistance, the HBT sensor serves as a wearable force sensor to monitor the full-range human physiological motions regardless of whether the conditions are normal or wet. This work provides a new pathway to design the MXene pressure sensor with high reliability and demonstrates the promising usage of HBT sensors in portable biomedical electronics."

Its slow and variable progression makes the development of new treatments highly dependent on validated biomarkers that can quantify disease progression and response to drug interventions. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to build a tool that estimates FSHD clinical severity based on behavioral features captured using smartphone and remote sensor data. The adoption of remote monitoring tools, such as smartphones and wearables, would provide a novel opportunity for continuous, passive, and objective monitoring of FSHD symptom severity outside the clinic. METHODS: In total, 38 genetically confirmed patients with FSHD were enrolled. The FSHD Clinical Score and the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test were used to assess FSHD symptom severity at days 0 and 42. Remote sensor data were collected using an Android smartphone, Withings Steel HR+, Body+, and BPM Connect+ for 6 continuous weeks. We created 2 single-task regression models that estimated the FSHD Clinical Score and TUG separately. Further, we built 1 multitask regression model that estimated the 2 clinical assessments simultaneously. Further, we assessed how an increasingly incremental time window affected the model performance. To do so, we trained the models on an incrementally increasing time window (from day 1 until day 14) and evaluated the predictions of the clinical severity on the remaining 4 weeks of data. RESULTS: The single-task regression models achieved an R(2) of 0.57 and 0.59 and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 2.09 and 1.66 when estimating FSHD Clinical Score and TUG, respectively. Time spent at a health-related location (such as a gym or hospital) and call duration were features that were predictive of both clinical assessments. The multitask model achieved an R(2) of 0.66 and 0.81 and an RMSE of 1.97 and 1.61 for the FSHD Clinical Score and TUG, respectively, and therefore outperformed the single-task models in estimating clinical severity. The 3 most important features selected by the multitask model were light sleep duration, total steps per day, and mean steps per minute. Using an increasing time window (starting from day 1 to day 14) for the FSHD Clinical Score, TUG, and multitask estimation yielded an average R(2) of 0.65, 0.79, and 0.76 and an average RMSE of 3.37, 2.05, and 4.37, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that smartphone and remote sensor data could be used to estimate FSHD clinical severity and therefore complement the assessment of FSHD outside the clinic. In addition, our results illustrated that training the models on the first week of data allows for consistent and stable prediction of FSHD symptom severity. Longitudinal follow-up studies should be conducted to further validate the reliability and validity of the multitask model as a tool to monitor disease progression over a longer period.

The manufacturers of these devices provide proprietary software that labels the sensor data at specified time intervals with activity and sleep information. If the device wearer has a health condition affecting their movement, such as a stroke, these labels and their values can vary greatly from manufacturer to manufacturer. Consequently, generating outcome predictions based on data collected from patients attending inpatient rehabilitation wearing different sensor devices can be challenging, which hampers usefulness of these data for patient care decisions. In this article, we present a data-driven approach to combining datasets collected from different device manufacturers. With the ability to combine datasets, we merge data from three different device manufacturers to form a larger dataset of time series data collected from 44 patients receiving inpatient therapy services. To gain insights into the recovery process, we use this dataset to build models that predict a patient's next day physical activity duration and next night sleep duration. Using our data-driven approach and the combined dataset, we obtained a normalized root mean square error prediction of 9.11% for daytime physical activity and 11.18% for nighttime sleep duration. Our sleep result is comparable to the accuracy we achieved using the manufacturer's sleep labels (12.26%). Our device-independent predictions are suitable for both point-of-care and remote monitoring applications to provide information to clinicians for customizing therapy services and potentially decreasing recovery time."

Current gait analysis methods, such as wearables or cameras, have privacy and operational constraints, especially when used with older adults. Millimeter-Wave (MMW) radar is a promising solution for gait applications because of its low-cost, better privacy, and resilience to ambient light and climate conditions. This paper presents a novel human gait analysis method that combines the micro-Doppler spectrogram and skeletal pose estimation using MMW radar for HAR. In our approach, we used the Texas Instruments IWR6843ISK-ODS MMW radar to obtain the micro-Doppler spectrogram and point clouds for 19 human joints. We developed a multilayer Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize and classify five different gait patterns with an accuracy of 95.7 to 98.8% using MMW radar data. During training of the CNN algorithm, we used the extracted 3D coordinates of 25 joints using the Kinect V2 sensor and compared them with the point clouds data to improve the estimation. Finally, we performed a real-time simulation to observe the point cloud behavior for different activities and validated our system against the ground truth values. The proposed method demonstrates the ability to distinguish between different human activities to obtain clinically relevant gait information."

However, wireless, continuous monitoring and analysis of these activities directly from the throat skin have not been developed. Here, we report the design and validation of a fully integrated standalone stretchable device platform that provides wireless measurements and machine learning-based analysis of diverse vibrations and muscle electrical activities from the throat. We demonstrate that the modified composite hydrogel with low contact impedance and reduced adhesion provides high-quality long-term monitoring of local muscle electrical signals. We show that the integrated triaxial broad-band accelerometer also measures large body movements and subtle physiological activities/vibrations. We find that the combined data processed by a 2D-like sequential feature extractor with fully connected neurons facilitates the classification of various motion/speech features at a high accuracy of over 90%, which adapts to the data with noise from motion artifacts or the data from new human subjects. The resulting standalone stretchable device with wireless monitoring and machine learning-based processing capabilities paves the way to design and apply wearable skin-interfaced systems for the remote monitoring and treatment evaluation of various diseases."

Outdoor open raceway pond (ORP) cultivation enables utilization of sunlight and atmospheric carbon dioxide to drive microalgal biomass synthesis for production of bioproducts including biofuels; however, environmental conditions are highly dynamic and fluctuate both diurnally and seasonally, making ORP productivity prediction challenging without time-intensive physical measurements and location-specific calibrations. Here, for the first time, we present an image-based deep learning method for the prediction of ORP productivity. Our method is based on parameter profile plot images of sensor parameters, including pH, dissolved oxygen, temperature, photosynthetically active radiation, and total dissolved solids. These parameters can be remotely monitored without physical interaction with ORPs. We apply the model to data we generated during the Unified Field Studies of the Algae Testbed Public-Private-Partnership (ATP(3) UFS), the largest publicly available ORP data set to date, which includes millions of sensor records and 598 productivities from 32 ORPs operated in 5 states in the United States. We demonstrate that this approach significantly outperforms an average value based traditional machine learning method (R(2) = 0.77 ≫ R(2) = 0.39) without considering bioprocess parameters (e.g., biomass density, hydraulic retention time, and nutrient concentrations). We then evaluate the sensitivity of image and monitoring data resolutions and input parameter variations. Our results demonstrate ORP productivity can be effectively predicted from remote monitoring data, providing an inexpensive tool for microalgal production and operational forecasting."
2021 Sep-Dec,Digital biomarkers,10.1159/000517885 [doi],Landers M; Dorsey R; Saria S,"Digital Endpoints: Definition, Benefits, and Current Barriers in Accelerating Development and Adoption.",Switzerland,"The assessment of health and disease requires a set of criteria to define health status and progression. These health measures are referred to as ""endpoints."" A ""digital endpoint"" is defined by its use of sensor-generated data often collected outside of a clinical setting such as in a patient's free-living environment. Applicable sensors exist in an array of devices and can be applied in a diverse set of contexts. For example, a smartphone's microphone might be used to diagnose or predict mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease or a wrist-worn activity monitor (such as those found in smartwatches) may be used to measure a drug's effect on the nocturnal activity of patients with sickle cell disease. Digital endpoints are generating considerable excitement because they permit a more authentic assessment of the patient's experience, reveal formerly untold realities of disease burden, and can cut drug discovery costs in half. However, before these benefits can be realized, effort must be applied not only to the technical creation of digital endpoints but also to the environment that allows for their development and application. The future of digital endpoints rests on meaningful interdisciplinary collaboration, sufficient evidence that digital endpoints can realize their promise, and the development of an ecosystem in which the vast quantities of data that digital endpoints generate can be analyzed. The fundamental nature of health care is changing. With coronavirus disease 2019 serving as a catalyst, there has been a rapid expansion of home care models, telehealth, and remote patient monitoring. The increasing adoption of these health-care innovations will expedite the requirement for a digital characterization of clinical status as current assessment tools often rely upon direct interaction with patients and thus are not fit for purpose to be administered remotely. With the ubiquity of relatively inexpensive sensors, digital endpoints are positioned to drive this consequential change. It is therefore not surprising that regulators, physicians, researchers, and consultants have each offered their assessment of these novel tools. However, as we further describe later, the broad adoption of digital endpoints will require a cooperative effort. In this article, we present an analysis of the current state of digital endpoints. We also attempt to unify the perspectives of the parties involved in the development and deployment of these tools. We conclude with an interdependent list of challenges that must be collaboratively addressed before these endpoints are widely adopted."

Unfortunately, existing SV measurement methods are limited in the clinic because of their invasiveness (eg, thermodilution), location (eg, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging), or unreliability (eg, bioimpedance). Multimodal wearable sensing, leveraging the seismocardiogram, a sternal vibration signal associated with cardiomechanical activity, offers a means to monitoring SV conveniently, affordably, and continuously. However, it has not been evaluated in a population with significant anatomical and physiological differences (ie, children with CHD) or compared against a true gold standard (ie, cardiac magnetic resonance). Here, we present the feasibility of wearable estimation of SV in a diverse CHD population (N=45 patients). Methods and Results We used our chest-worn wearable biosensor to measure baseline ECG and seismocardiogram signals from patients with CHD before and after their routine cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging, and derived features from the measured signals, predominantly systolic time intervals, to estimate SV using ridge regression. Wearable signal features achieved acceptable SV estimation (28% error with respect to cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging) in a held-out test set, per cardiac output measurement guidelines, with a root-mean-square error of 11.48 mL and R(2) of 0.76. Additionally, we observed that using a combination of electrical and cardiomechanical features surpassed the performance of either modality alone. Conclusions A convenient wearable biosensor that estimates SV enables remote monitoring of cardiac function and may potentially help identify decompensation in patients with CHD."

Unlike traditional in-person evaluation or ecological momentary assessment (EMA) questionnaire-based approaches, these data sources open many possibilities in remote patient monitoring. However, defining robust models is challenging due to the data's noisy and frequently missing observations. This work proposes an attention-based Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network-based pipeline for predicting mobility impairment based on WHODAS 2.0 evaluation from such digital biomarkers. Furthermore, we addressed the missing observation problem by utilising hidden Markov models and the possibility of including information from unlabelled samples via transfer learning. We validated our approach using two wearable/mobile sensor data sets collected in the wild and socio-demographic information about the patients. Our results showed that in the WHODAS 2.0 mobility impairment prediction task, the proposed pipeline outperformed a prior baseline while additionally providing interpretability with attention heatmaps. Moreover, using a much smaller cohort via task transfer learning, the same model could learn to predict generalised anxiety severity accurately based on GAD-7 scores."

Such a feature enabled the bending sensor to simultaneously have a wide dynamic range of bending strain (0.025-5.4%), high gauge factor (∼74), and high linearity (R(2) ∼ 0.99). Furthermore, the bending sensor can capture repeated instantaneous changes in strain and various types of vibrations, owing to its fast response time. Moreover, the bending direction can be differentiated with a single layer of the sensor, and using an array of sensors integrated on a glove, object recognition was demonstrated via machine learning. Finally, a self-monitoring proprioceptive ionic electroactive polymer (IEAP) actuator capable of operating in liquid was demonstrated. Such features of our bending sensor will enable a simple and effective way of detecting sophisticated motion, thus potentially advancing wearable healthcare monitoring electronics and enabling proprioceptive soft robotics."

Data-driven tools and novel technologies have the capability to address these shortcomings, but insights from all stakeholders in the care continuum remain lacking. A structured online questionnaire was given to respondents (n = 1432) in nine global geographies to investigate attitudes to the use of data and novel technologies in the management of vascular disease. Patients with coronary or peripheral artery disease (n = 961), physicians responsible for their care (n = 345), and administrators/healthcare leaders with responsibility for commissioning/procuring cardiovascular services (n = 126) were included. Narrative themes arising from the survey included patients' desire for more personalized healthcare, shared decision-making, and improved communication. Patients, administrators, and physicians perceived and experienced deficiencies in continuity of care, and all acknowledged the potential for data-driven techniques and novel technologies to address some of these shortcomings. Further, physicians and administrators saw the 'upstream' segment of the care journey-before diagnosis, at point of diagnosis, and when determining treatment-as key to enabling tangible improvements in patient experience and outcomes. Finally, despite acceptance that data sharing is critical to the success of such interventions, there remains persistent issues related to trust and transparency. The current fragmented care continuum could be improved and streamlined through the adoption of advanced data analytics and novel technologies, including diagnostic and monitoring techniques. Such an approach could enable the refocusing of healthcare from intermittent contacts and intervention-only focus to a more holistic patient view."

Security and privacy are key concerns on the IoMT, owing to the huge scale and deployment of IoMT networks. Machine learning (ML) and blockchain (BC) technologies have significantly enhanced the capabilities and facilities of healthcare 5.0, spawning a new area known as ""Smart Healthcare."" By identifying concerns early, a smart healthcare system can help avoid long-term damage. This will enhance the quality of life for patients while reducing their stress and healthcare costs. The IoMT enables a range of functionalities in the field of information technology, one of which is smart and interactive health care. However, combining medical data into a single storage location to train a powerful machine learning model raises concerns about privacy, ownership, and compliance with greater concentration. Federated learning (FL) overcomes the preceding difficulties by utilizing a centralized aggregate server to disseminate a global learning model. Simultaneously, the local participant keeps control of patient information, assuring data confidentiality and security. This article conducts a comprehensive analysis of the findings on blockchain technology entangled with federated learning in healthcare. 5.0. The purpose of this study is to construct a secure health monitoring system in healthcare 5.0 by utilizing a blockchain technology and Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to detect any malicious activity in a healthcare network and enables physicians to monitor patients through medical sensors and take necessary measures periodically by predicting diseases. The proposed system demonstrates that the approach is optimized effectively for healthcare monitoring.

Miniaturized wearable sensors are auspicious tools for biomedicine and healthcare systems. In this paper, we present D-SORM, a sensor fusion-based digital solution intended to assist clinicians and improve their diagnosis by providing objective measurements and automatic recognition. The aim is to supply an interface for remote monitoring to the medical staff. METHODS: D-SORM platform estimates the wearable device attitude based on its acquired data, and visualizes it in real-time using a graphical user interface (GUI). It also integrates two modules which serve two different medical applications. The first one is arm tele-rehabilitation, where sessions are done online. The practitioner gives the instructions while wearing the device, and the patient has to reproduce the gestures. A processing unit is dedicated to compute statistical features and calculate the success rate. The second one is human motion tracking for elderly care. A novel machine learning architecture is proposed, based on feature fusion, to predict the activities of daily living. RESULTS: The rehabilitation mechanism was tested under supervised conditions, by performing a set of movements. D-SORM provides extra information and objective measurements, thus facilitates the diagnosis of clinicians. The human activity recognition is also validated using a public dataset. With D-SORM, an efficiency ranging from 97.7% to 99.65% is ensured under unsupervised conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed design constitutes a digital clinical tool for medical teams allowing remote health monitoring. It overcomes geographical barriers while providing faster and highly accurate assessment."

In this proof-of-concept study, we used a machine learning approach to explore the potential added value of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and patient-generated health data (PGHD) in predicting post-discharge complications for gastrointestinal (GI) and lung cancer surgery patients. METHODS: We formulated post-discharge complication prediction as a binary classification task. Features were extracted from clinical variables, PROs (MD Anderson Symptom Inventory [MDASI]), and PGHD (VivoFit) from a cohort of 52 patients with 134 temporal observation points pre- and post-discharge that were collected from two pilot studies. We trained and evaluated supervised learning classifiers via nested cross-validation. RESULTS: A logistic regression model with L(2) regularization trained with clinical data, PROs and PGHD from wearable pedometers achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic of 0.74. CONCLUSIONS: PROs and PGHDs captured through remote patient telemonitoring approaches have the potential to improve prediction performance for postoperative complications."

Although most of them would like to stay in their own homes, as they feel comfortable and safe, in some cases, older people are taken to special institutions, such as nursing homes. In order to provide serious and quality care to elderly people at home, continuous remote monitoring is perceived as a solution to keep them connected to healthcare service providers. The new trend in medical health services, in general, is to move from 'hospital-centric' services to 'home-centric' services with the aim of reducing the costs of medical treatments and improving the recovery experience of patients, among other benefits for both patients and medical centers. Smart energy data captured from electrical home appliance sensors open a new opportunity for remote healthcare monitoring, linking the patient's health-state/health-condition with routine behaviors and activities over time. It is known that deviation from the normal routine can indicate abnormal conditions such as sleep disturbance, confusion, or memory problems. This work proposes the development and deployment of a smart energy data with activity recognition (SEDAR) system that uses machine learning (ML) techniques to identify appliance usage and behavior patterns oriented to older people living alone. The proposed system opens the door to a range of applications that go beyond healthcare, such as energy management strategies, load balancing techniques, and appliance-specific optimizations. This solution impacts on the massive adoption of telehealth in third-world economies where access to smart meters is still limited."

To reduce the outbreak impact of COVID-19 virus illness, continual identification and remote surveillance of patients are essential. Medical service delivery based on the Internet of Things (IoT) technology backed up by the fog-cloud paradigm is an efficient and time-sensitive solution for remote patient surveillance. Conspicuously, a comprehensive framework based on Radio Frequency Identification Device (RFID) and body-wearable sensor technologies supported by the fog-cloud platform is proposed for the identification and management of COVID-19 patients. The J48 decision tree is used to assess the infection degree of the user based on corresponding symptoms. RFID is used to detect Temporal Proximity Interactions (TPI) among users. Using TPI quantification, Temporal Network Analysis is used to analyze and track the current stage of the COVID-19 spread. The statistical performance and accuracy of the framework are assessed by utilizing synthetically-generated data for 250,000 users. Based on the comparative analysis, the proposed framework acquired an enhanced measure of classification accuracy, and sensitivity of 96.68% and 94.65% respectively.

The viscoelastic strain of stretchable materials often results in nonlinear stress-strain characteristics over a broad range of strains, consequently making the stretchable sensors at the body joints less accurate in predicting and recognizing human gestures. Accurate recognition of human gestures can be further deteriorated by environmental changes such as temperature and humidity. Here, we demonstrated an environment-adaptable high stress-strain linearity (up to ε = 150%) and high-durability (>100,000 cycles) stretchable sensor conformally laminated onto the body joints for human gesture recognition. The serpentine configuration of our ionic liquid-based stretchable film enabled us to construct broad data sets of mechanical strain and temperature changes for machine learning-based gesture recognition. Signal recognition and training of distinct strains and environmental stimuli using a machine learning-based algorithm analysis successfully measured and predicted the joint motion in a temperature-changing environment with an accuracy of 92.86% (R-squared). Therefore, we believe that our serpentine-shaped ion gel-based stretchable sensor harmonized with machine-learning analysis will be a significant achievement toward environmentally adaptive and multianalyte sensing applications. Our proposed machine learning-enabled multisensor system may enable the development of future electronic devices such as wearable electronics, soft robotics, electronic skin, and human-machine interaction systems."

B,10.1039/d3tb02247a [doi],Iravani S; Rabiee N; Makvandi P,Advancements in MXene-based composites for electronic skins.,England,"MXenes are a class of two-dimensional (2D) materials that have gained significant attention in the field of electronic skins (E-skins). MXene-based composites offer several advantages for E-skins, including high electrical conductivity, mechanical flexibility, transparency, and chemical stability. Their mechanical flexibility allows for conformal integration onto various surfaces, enabling the creation of E-skins that can closely mimic human skin. In addition, their high surface area facilitates enhanced sensitivity and responsiveness to external stimuli, making them ideal for sensing applications. Notably, MXene-based composites can be integrated into E-skins to create sensors that can detect various stimuli, such as temperature, pressure, strain, and humidity. These sensors can be used for a wide range of applications, including health monitoring, robotics, and human-machine interfaces. However, challenges related to scalability, integration, and biocompatibility need to be addressed. One important challenge is achieving long-term stability under harsh conditions such as high humidity. MXenes are susceptible to oxidation, which can degrade their electrical and mechanical properties over time. Another crucial challenge is the scalability of MXene synthesis, as large-scale production methods need to be developed to meet the demand for commercial applications. Notably, the integration of MXenes with other components, such as energy storage devices or flexible electronics, requires further developments to ensure compatibility and optimize overall performance. By addressing issues related to material stability, mechanical flexibility, scalability, sensing performance, and power supply, MXene-based E-skins can develop the fields of healthcare monitoring/diagnostics, prosthetics, motion monitoring, wearable electronics, and human-robot interactions. The integration of MXenes with emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence or internet of things, can unlock new functionalities and applications for E-skins, ranging from healthcare monitoring to virtual reality interfaces. This review aims to examine the challenges, advantages, and limitations of MXenes and their composites in E-skins, while also exploring the future prospects and potential advancements in this field."

Wearable sensors enable the collection of real-world data that can complement such clinical assessments and provide a more comprehensive insight into disease symptoms. In this context, almost all studies are focused on assessing lower limb function via monitoring of gait, physical activity and ambulation. In this study, we monitor upper limb function during activities of daily living in individuals with HD (n = 16), prodromal HD (pHD, n = 7), and controls (CTR, n = 16) using a wrist-worn wearable sensor, called PAMSys ULM, over seven days. The participants were highly compliant in wearing the sensor with an average daily compliance of 99% (100% for HD, 98% for pHD, and 99% for CTR). Goal-directed movements (GDM) of the hand were detected using a deep learning model, and kinematic features of each GDM were estimated. The collected data was used to predict disease groups (i.e., HD, pHD, and CTR) and clinical scores using a combination of statistical and machine learning-based models. Significant differences in GDM features were observed between the groups. HD participants performed fewer GDMs with long duration (> 7.5 seconds) compared to CTR (p-val = 0.021, d = -0.86). In velocity and acceleration metrics, the highest effect size feature was the entropy of the velocity zero-crossing length segments (HD vs CTR p-val <0.001, d = -1.67; HD vs pHD p-val = 0.043, d=-0.98; CTR vs pHD p-val = 0.046, d=0.96). In addition, this same variable showed a strongest correlation with clinical scores. Classification models achieved good performance in distinguishing HD, pHD and CTR individuals with a balanced accuracy of 67% and a 0.72 recall for the HD group, while regression models accurately predicted clinical scores. Notably the explained variance for the upper extremity function subdomain scale of Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) was the highest, with the model capturing 60% of the variance. Our findings suggest the potential of wearables and machine learning for early identification of phenoconversion, remote monitoring in HD, and evaluating new treatments efficacy in clinical trials and medicine."

The accurate activity classification results from the HAR enhance the performance of the healthcare system with broad applications. HAR results are useful in monitoring a person's health, and the system predicts abnormal activities based on user movements. The HAR system's abnormal activity predictions provide better healthcare monitoring and reduce users' health issues. The conventional HAR systems use wearable sensors, such as inertial measurement unit (IMU) and stretch sensors for activity recognition. These approaches show remarkable performances to the user's basic activities such as sitting, standing, and walking. However, when the user performs complex activities, such as running, jumping, and lying, the sensor-based HAR systems have a higher degree of misclassification results due to the reading errors from sensors. These sensor errors reduce the overall performance of the HAR system with the worst classification results. Similarly, radiofrequency or vision-based HAR systems are not free from classification errors when used in real time. In this paper, we address some of the existing challenges of HAR systems by proposing a human image threshing (HIT) machine-based HAR system that uses an image dataset from a smartphone camera for activity recognition. The HIT machine effectively uses a mask region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN) for human body detection, a facial image threshing machine (FIT) for image cropping and resizing, and a deep learning model for activity classification. We demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed HIT machine-based HAR system through extensive experiments and results. The proposed HIT machine achieved 98.53% accuracy when the ResNet architecture was used as its deep learning model."

Models include technology such as machine learning and smart wearables, that can be used to integrate patient data and improve continuity of care. This model may have benefits in situations where patient deterioration must be detected quickly so that a rapid response can occur such as cardiopulmonary settings. AIM: The purpose of this scoping review was to examine the evidence for a digital hospital model of care, in the context of cardiac and pulmonary settings. DESIGN: Scoping review. DATA SOURCES: Databases searched were using PsycInfo, Ovid MEDLINE, and CINAHL. Studies written in English and containing key terms related to digital hospital and cardiopulmonary care were included. The Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for systematic reviews was used to assess the risk of bias. RESULTS: Thirteen (13) studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. For cardiac conditions, a deep-learning-based rapid response system warning system for predicting patient deterioration leading to cardiac arrest had up to 257% higher sensitivity than conventional methods. There was also a reduction in the number of patients who needed to be examined by a physician. Using continuous telemonitoring with a wireless real-time electrocardiogram compared with non-monitoring, there was improved initial resuscitation and 24-hour post-event survival for high-risk patients. However, there were no benefits for survival to discharge. For pulmonary conditions, a natural language processing algorithm reduced the time to asthma diagnosis, demonstrating high predictive values. Virtual inhaler education was found to be as effective as in-person education, and prescription error was reduced following the implementation of computer-based physician order entry electronic medical records and a clinical decision support tool. CONCLUSIONS: While we currently have only a brief glimpse at the impact of technology care delivery for cardiac and respiratory conditions, technology presents an opportunity to improve quality and safety in care, but only with the support of adequate infrastructure and processes.

Survivors experience significant impairment in mobility and daily activities, which requires extensive rehabilitative interventions to assist them to regain lost skills and restore independence. The advent of remote rehabilitation architecture and enabling technology mandates the elaboration of sensing mechanisms tailored to individual clinical needs. This study aims to review current trends in the application of sensing mechanisms in remote monitoring and rehabilitation in neurological diseases, and to provide clinical insights to develop bespoke sensing mechanisms. A systematic search was performed using the PubMED database to identify 16 papers published for the period between 2018 to 2022. Teleceptive sensors (56%) were utilized more often than wearable proximate sensors (50%). The most commonly used modality was infrared (38%) and acceleration force (38%), followed by RGB color, EMG, light and temperature, and radio signal. The strategy adopted to improve the sensing mechanism included a multimodal sensor, the application of multiple sensors, sensor fusion, and machine learning. Most of the stroke studies utilized biofeedback control systems (78%) while the majority of studies for neurodegenerative disorders used sensors for remote monitoring (57%). Functional assessment tools that the sensing mechanism may emulate to produce clinically valid information were proposed and factors affecting user adoption were described. Lastly, the limitations and directions for further development were discussed."

Over 4 million Americans are hospitalized every year due to heart failure (HF), with a median length of stay of 4 days and an in-hospital mortality rate that exceeds 5%. Hospitalizations of patients with HF can be prevented by early detection of lung congestion. Our study assessed a new contact-free optical medical device used for the early detection of lung congestion. METHODS: The Gili system is an FDA-cleared device used for measuring chest motion vibration data. Lung congestion in the study was assessed clinically and verified via two cardiologists. An algorithm was developed using machine learning techniques, and cross-validation of the findings was performed to estimate the accuracy of the algorithm. RESULTS: A total of 227 patients were recruited (101 cases vs. 126 controls). The sensitivity and specificity for the device in our study were 0.91 (95% CI: 0.86-0.93) and 0.91 (95% CI: 0.87-0.94), respectively. In all instances, the observed estimates of PPVs and NPVs were at least 0.82 and 0.90, respectively. The accuracy of the algorithm was not affected by different covariates (including respiratory or valvular conditions). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the efficacy of a contact-free optical device for detecting lung congestion. Further validation of the study results across a larger and precise scale is warranted."

The steady progress of IHD leads to an irreversible condition called myocardial infarction (MI). The detection of MI can be done by observing the altered electrocardiogram (ECG) characteristics. Often, automated ECG analysis is preferred in place of visual inspection to reduce time and ensure reliable detection even when the recording quality is not very good. This paper presents an automated approach to classify recent MI, past MI, and normal sinus rhythm (NSR) classes based on the morphological features of the ECG. In clinical practice, a standard 12-lead ECG setup is typically employed to identify MI. However, acquiring a 12-lead ECG is not always convenient. Hence, in this study, we have explored the possibility of using a minimal number of ECG leads by deriving the augmented limb leads using leads I and II. A well-known and widely used ensemble machine learning tool, the random forest (RF) classifier is trained using features extracted from the derived augmented limb leads and their combinations. An RF classifier built using features extracted from all limb leads has outperformed classifiers built on combinations of them with five-fold cross-validation training accuracy of 97.9 (±0.008) % and testing accuracy of 98 %.Clinical relevance- As high sensitivity is reported in identifying recent MI and past MI classes, the proposed approach is suitable for preventative healthcare applications since it is less likely that subjects with recent or past MI will be misclassified. Due to its low computational complexity, better interpretability, and comparable performance to the state-of-the-art results, the proposed approach can be employed in clinical and cardiac health screening applications. It also has the potential to be employed in remote monitoring with mobile and wearable devices because it is built on features extracted from only lead I and II ECG recordings."

This study aimed to develop and compare prognosis prediction machine learning models based on invasive laboratory and noninvasive clinical and demographic data from patients' day of admission. Three Support Vector Machine (SVM) models were developed and compared using invasive, non-invasive, and both groups. The results suggested that non-invasive features could provide mortality predictions that are similar to the invasive and roughly on par with the joint model. Feature inspection results from SVM-RFE and sparsity analysis displayed that, compared with the invasive model, the non-invasive model can provide better performances with a fewer number of features, pointing to the presence of high predictive information contents in several non-invasive features, including SPO2, age, and cardiovascular disorders. Furthermore, while the invasive model was able to provide better mortality predictions for the imminent future, non-invasive features displayed better performance for more distant expiration intervals. Early mortality prediction using non-invasive models can give us insights as to where and with whom to intervene. Combined with novel technologies, such as wireless wearable devices, these models can create powerful frameworks for various medical assignments and patient triage."

However, such techniques are not always effectively implemented or timely available in the routine clinical practice. In recent years, the widespread availability of e-health solutions has stimulated the development of blood pressure telemonitoring (BPT) systems, which allow remote BP tracking and tighter and more efficient monitoring of patients' health status. RECENT FINDINGS: There is currently strong evidence that BPT may be of benefit for hypertension screening and diagnosis and for improving hypertension management. The advantage is more significant when BPT is coupled with multimodal interventions involving a physician, a nurse or pharmacist, and including education on lifestyle and risk factors and drug management. Several randomized controlled studies documented enhanced hypertension management and improved BP control of hypertensive patients through BPT. Potential additional effects of BPT are represented by improved compliance to treatment, intensification, and optimization of drug use, improved quality of life, reduction in risk of developing cardiovascular complications, and cost-saving. Applications based on m-health and making use of wearables or smartwatches integrated with machine learning models are particularly promising for the future development of efficient BPT solutions, and they will provide remarkable support decision tools for doctors. BPT and telehealth will soon disrupt hypertension management. However, which approach will be the most effective and whether it will be sustainable in the long-term still need to be elucidated."

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the utility of wearable telemonitoring technologies to predict treatment outcomes using patient activity metrics and machine learning. METHODS: In this prospective, single-center, single-cohort study, patients scheduled for pancreatectomy were provided with a wearable telemonitoring device to be worn prior to surgery. Patient clinical data were collected and all patients were evaluated using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program surgical risk calculator (ACS-NSQIP SRC). Machine learning models were developed to predict whether patients would have a textbook outcome and compared with the ACS-NSQIP SRC using area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves. RESULTS: Between February 2019 and February 2020, 48 patients completed the study. Patient activity metrics were collected over an average of 27.8 days before surgery. Patients took an average of 4162.1 (SD 4052.6) steps per day and had an average heart rate of 75.6 (SD 14.8) beats per minute. Twenty-eight (58%) patients had a textbook outcome after pancreatectomy. The group of 20 (42%) patients who did not have a textbook outcome included 14 patients with severe complications and 11 patients requiring readmission. The ACS-NSQIP SRC had an AUROC curve of 0.6333 to predict failure to achieve a textbook outcome, while our model combining patient clinical characteristics and patient activity data achieved the highest performance with an AUROC curve of 0.7875. CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning models outperformed ACS-NSQIP SRC estimates in predicting textbook outcomes after pancreatectomy. The highest performance was observed when machine learning models incorporated patient clinical characteristics and activity metrics."

It has been shown to improve psychological and physiological function across populations. However, a means to remotely use and monitor this approach would allow for wider use of this technique. Advancements in wearable and digital technology present an opportunity for the widespread application of this approach. OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of the study was to determine the feasibility of fully remote, self-administered short sessions of HRV-directed biofeedback in a diverse population of health care workers (HCWs). The secondary aim was to determine whether a fully remote, HRV-directed biofeedback intervention significantly alters longitudinal HRV over the intervention period, as monitored by wearable devices. The tertiary aim was to estimate the impact of this intervention on metrics of psychological well-being. METHODS: To determine whether remotely implemented short sessions of HRV biofeedback can improve autonomic metrics and psychological well-being, we enrolled HCWs across 7 hospitals in New York City in the United States. They downloaded our study app, watched brief educational videos about HRV biofeedback, and used a well-studied HRV biofeedback program remotely through their smartphone. HRV biofeedback sessions were used for 5 minutes per day for 5 weeks. HCWs were then followed for 12 weeks after the intervention period. Psychological measures were obtained over the study period, and they wore an Apple Watch for at least 7 weeks to monitor the circadian features of HRV. RESULTS: In total, 127 HCWs were enrolled in the study. Overall, only 21 (16.5%) were at least 50% compliant with the HRV biofeedback intervention, representing a small portion of the total sample. This demonstrates that this study design does not feasibly result in adequate rates of compliance with the intervention. Numerical improvement in psychological metrics was observed over the 17-week study period, although it did not reach statistical significance (all P>.05). Using a mixed effect cosinor model, the mean midline-estimating statistic of rhythm (MESOR) of the circadian pattern of the SD of the interbeat interval of normal sinus beats (SDNN), an HRV metric, was observed to increase over the first 4 weeks of the biofeedback intervention in HCWs who were at least 50% compliant. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we found that using brief remote HRV biofeedback sessions and monitoring its physiological effect using wearable devices, in the manner that the study was conducted, was not feasible. This is considering the low compliance rates with the study intervention. We found that remote short sessions of HRV biofeedback demonstrate potential promise in improving autonomic nervous function and warrant further study. Wearable devices can monitor the physiological effects of psychological interventions."

While there is no cure, levodopa therapy has been shown to mitigate symptoms. A patient on levodopa experiences cycles in the severity of their symptoms, characterized by an ON state-when the drug is active-and an OFF state-when symptoms worsen as the drug wears off. The longitudinal progression of the disease is monitored using episodic assessments performed by trained physicians in the clinic, such as the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Lately, there has been an effort in the field to develop continuous, objective measures of motor symptoms based on wearable sensors and other remote monitoring devices. In this work, we present an effort towards such a solution that uses a single wearable inertial sensor to automatically assess the postural instability and gait disorder (PIGD) of a Parkinson's disease patient. Sensor data was collected from two independent studies of subjects performing the UPDRS test and then used to train and validate a convolutional neural network model. Given the typical limited size of such studies we also employed the use of generative adversarial networks to improve the performance of deep-learning models that usually require larger amounts of data for training. We show that for a 2-min walk test, our method's predicted PIGD scores can be used to identify a patient's ON/OFF states better than a physician evaluated on the same criteria. This result paves the way for more reliable, continuous tracking of Parkinson's disease symptoms."

In the healthcare industry, Internet of Things (IoT) driven fog computing is being developed to speed up the services for the general public and save billions of lives. This new computing platform, based on the fog computing paradigm, may reduce latency when transmitting and communicating signals with faraway servers, allowing medical services to be delivered more quickly in both spatial and temporal dimensions. One of the necessary qualities of computing systems that can enable the completion of healthcare operations is latency reduction. Fog computing can provide reduced latency when compared to cloud computing due to the use of only low-end computers, mobile phones, and personal devices in fog computing. In this paper, a new framework for healthcare monitoring for managing real-time notification based on fog computing has been proposed. The proposed system monitors the patient's body temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure values obtained from the sensors that are embedded into a wearable device and notifies the doctors or caregivers in real time if there occur any contradictions in the normal threshold value using the machine learning algorithms. The notification can also be set for the patients to alert them about the periodical medications or diet to be maintained by the patients. The cloud layer stores the big data into the cloud for future references for the hospitals and the researchers."

This topic is very important, as telemedicine and mHealth, when applied to dermatology, could improve both the quality of healthcare for citizens and the workflow in the health domain. The proposed study was centered on the last three years. We conducted an overview on the opportunities, the perspectives, and the problems involved in TD integration with mHealth. The methodology of the narrative review was based on: (I) a search of PubMed and Scopus and (II) an eligibility assessment, using properly proposed parameters. The outcome of the study showed that during the COVID-19 pandemic, TD integration with mHealth advanced rapidly. This integration enabled the monitoring of dermatological problems and facilitated remote specialist visits, reducing face-to-face interactions. AI and mobile apps have empowered citizens to take an active role in their healthcare. This differs from other imaging sectors where information exchange is limited to professionals. The opportunities for TD in mHealth include improving service quality, streamlining healthcare processes, reducing costs, and providing more accessible care. It can be applied to various conditions, such as (but not limited to) acne, vitiligo, psoriasis, and skin cancers. Integration with AI and augmented reality (AR), as well as the use of wearable sensors, are anticipated as future developments. However, integrating TD with mHealth also brings about problems and challenges related to regulations, ethics, cybersecurity, data privacy, and device management. Scholars and policymakers need to address these issues while involving citizens in the process."

In this regard, how to establish a reliable interfacial interaction is the key requirement for the successful integration of geometrically different components. Here, we present 1D/2D heterodimensional hybrids via dopant induced hybridization of 2D Ti(3)C(2)T(x) MXene with 1D nitrogen-doped graphene nanoribbon. Edge abundant nanoribbon structures allow a high level nitrogen doping (∼6.8 at%), desirable for the strong coordination interaction with Ti(3)C(2)T(x) MXene surface. For piezoresistive pressure sensor application, strong adhesion between the conductive layers and at the conductive layer/elastomer interface significantly diminishes the sensing hysteresis down to 1.33% and enhances the sensing stability up to 10 000 cycles at high pressure (100 kPa). Moreover, large-area pressure sensor array reveals a high potential for smart seat cushion-based posture monitoring application with high accuracy (>95%) by exploiting machine learning algorithm."

They provide the flexibility of monitoring elders remotely for their families and caregivers. Activities of daily living are an efficient way to effectively monitor elderly people at home and patients at caregiving facilities. The monitoring of such actions depends largely on IoT-based devices, either wireless or installed at different places. This paper proposes an effective and robust layered architecture using multisensory devices to recognize the activities of daily living from anywhere. Multimodality refers to the sensory devices of multiple types working together to achieve the objective of remote monitoring. Therefore, the proposed multimodal-based approach includes IoT devices, such as wearable inertial sensors and videos recorded during daily routines, fused together. The data from these multi-sensors have to be processed through a pre-processing layer through different stages, such as data filtration, segmentation, landmark detection, and 2D stick model. In next layer called the features processing, we have extracted, fused, and optimized different features from multimodal sensors. The final layer, called classification, has been utilized to recognize the activities of daily living via a deep learning technique known as convolutional neural network. It is observed from the proposed IoT-based multimodal layered system's results that an acceptable mean accuracy rate of 84.14% has been achieved."

Innovations made using technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), edge computing, cloud computing and artificial intelligence are helping address this crisis. The urge for remote monitoring, symptom analysis and early detection of diseases lead to tremendous increase in the deployment of wearable sensor devices. They facilitate seamless gathering of physiological data such as electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, respiration traces (RESP), galvanic skin response (GSR), pulse rate, body temperature, photoplethysmograms (PPG), oxygen saturation (SpO2) etc. For diagnosis and analysis purpose, the gathered data needs to be stored. Wearable devices operate on batteries and have a memory constraint. In mHealth application architectures, this gathered data is hence stored on cloud based servers. While transmitting data from wearable devices to cloud servers via edge devices, a lot of energy is consumed. This paper proposes a deep learning based compression model SCAElite that reduces the data volume, enabling energy efficient transmission. RESULTS: Stress Recognition in Automobile Drivers dataset and MIT-BIH dataset from PhysioNet are used for validation of algorithm performance. The model achieves a compression ratio of up to 300 fold with reconstruction errors within 8% over the stress recognition dataset and 106.34-fold with reconstruction errors within 8% over the MIT-BIH dataset. The computational complexity of SCAElite is 51.65% less compared to state-of-the-art deep compressive model. CONCLUSION: It is experimentally validated that SCAElite guarantees a high compression ratio with good quality restoration capabilities for physiological signal compression in mHealth applications. It has a compact architecture and is computationally more efficient compared to state-of-the-art deep compressive model."

A gold standard for quantitatively measuring physiotherapy participation is crucial to understanding physiotherapy adherence in managing recovery from LBP. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and evaluate a system with wearable inertial sensors to objectively detect the performance of unsupervised exercises for LBP comprising movement in multiple planes and sitting postures. METHODS: A quantitative classification design was used within a machine learning framework to detect exercise performance and posture in a cohort of healthy participants. A set of 8 inertial sensors were placed on the participants, and data were acquired as they performed 7 McKenzie low back exercises and 3 sitting posture positions. Engineered time series features were extracted from the data and used to train 9 models by using a 6-fold cross-validation approach, from which the best 2 models were selected for further study. In addition, a convolutional neural network was trained directly on the time series data. A feature importance analysis was performed to identify sensor locations and channels that contributed the most to the models. Finally, a subset of sensor locations and channels was included in a hyperparameter grid search to identify the optimal sensor configuration and best performing algorithms for exercise and posture classification. The final models were evaluated using the F(1) score in a 10-fold cross-validation approach. RESULTS: In total, 19 healthy adults with no history of LBP each completed at least one full session of exercises and postures. Random forest and XGBoost (extreme gradient boosting) models performed the best out of the initial set of 9 engineered feature models. The optimal hardware configuration was identified as a 3-sensor setup-lower back, left thigh, and right ankle sensors with acceleration, gyroscope, and magnetometer channels. The XGBoost model achieved the highest exercise (F(1) score: mean 0.94, SD 0.03) and posture (F(1) score: mean 0.90, SD 0.11) classification scores. The convolutional neural network achieved similar results with the same sensor locations, using only the accelerometer and gyroscope channels for exercise classification (F(1) score: mean 0.94, SD 0.02) and the accelerometer channel alone for posture classification (F(1) score: mean 0.88, SD 0.07). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the potential of a 3-sensor lower body wearable solution (eg, smart pants) that can identify exercises in multiple planes and proper sitting postures, which is suitable for the treatment of LBP. This technology has the potential to improve the effectiveness of LBP rehabilitation by facilitating quantitative feedback, early problem diagnosis, and possible remote monitoring."

Taking the Fried frailty criteria as a reference to determine physical frailty and frailty phenotypes (slowness, weakness, exhaustion, inactivity), this study aimed to explore the benefit of machine learning to determine the least number of digital biomarkers of physical frailty measurable from a pendant sensor during activities of daily living. Two hundred and fifty-nine older adults were classified into robust or pre-frail/frail groups based on the physical frailty assessments by the Fried frailty criteria. All participants wore a pendant sensor at the sternum level for 48 h. Of seventeen sensor-derived features extracted from a pendant sensor, fourteen significant features were used for machine learning based on logistic regression modeling and a recursive feature elimination technique incorporating bootstrapping. The combination of percentage time standing, percentage time walking, walking cadence, and longest walking bout were identified as optimal digital biomarkers of physical frailty and frailty phenotypes. These findings suggest that a combination of sensor-measured exhaustion, inactivity, and speed have potential to screen and monitor people for physical frailty and frailty phenotypes."

However, the practical applications of most wearable sensors are generally limited by their poor stretchability and sensitivity, unsatisfactory strength, lower conductivity, and single sensory function. Here a hydrogen bond cross-linked network based on carboxylic styrene butadiene rubber (XSBR) and hydrophilic sericin (SS) non-covalently modified carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is rationally designed and then fabricated into multi-functional sensors. The resultant versatile sensors are able to detect both weak and large deformations, which owns a low detection limit of 1% strain, high stretchability up to 217%, superior strength of 12.58 MPa, high sensitivity with a gauge factor up to 25.98, high conductivity of 0.071 S m(-1) , and lower percolation threshold of 0.504 wt%. Moreover, the prepared sensors also possess an impressively thermal response (0.01636 °C(-1) ) and realize the application in the measurement of human body temperature.

Blood oxygen level, heart rate, and body temperature data are crucial for managing the disease and ensuring timely medical care. This study proposes a low-cost wearable device employing non-contact sensors to monitor, process, and visualize critical variables, focusing on body temperature measurement as a key health indicator. The wearable device developed offers a non-invasive and continuous method to gather wrist and forehead temperature data. However, since there is a discrepancy between wrist and actual forehead temperature, this study incorporates statistical methods and machine learning to estimate the core forehead temperature from the wrist. This research collects 2130 samples from 30 volunteers, and both the statistical least squares method and machine learning via linear regression are applied to analyze these data. It is observed that all models achieve a significant fit, but the third-degree polynomial model stands out in both approaches. It achieves an R(2) value of 0.9769 in the statistical analysis and 0.9791 in machine learning."

Continuous remote monitoring of physiological parameters and symptom changes offers the potential for timely intervention, improved patient outcomes, and reduced health care costs. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated whether a real-time multimodal program using commercially available wearable technology, home-based Bluetooth-enabled spirometers, finger pulse oximeters, and smartphone apps is feasible and acceptable for patients with chronic respiratory diseases, as well as the value of low-burden, long-term passive data collection. METHODS: In a 3-arm prospective observational cohort feasibility study, we recruited 60 patients from the Royal Free Hospital and University College Hospital. These patients had been diagnosed with interstitial lung disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or post-COVID-19 condition (n=20 per group) and were followed for 180 days. This study used a comprehensive remote monitoring system designed to provide real-time and relevant data for both patients and clinicians. Data were collected using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture; Vanderbilt University) periodic surveys, Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapses-base active app questionnaires, wearables, finger pulse oximeters, smartphone apps, and Bluetooth home-based spirometry. The feasibility of remote monitoring was measured through adherence to the protocol, engagement during the follow-up period, retention rate, acceptability, and data integrity. RESULTS: Lowest-burden passive data collection methods, via wearables, demonstrated superior adherence, engagement, and retention compared with active data collection methods, with an average wearable use of 18.66 (SD 4.69) hours daily (77.8% of the day), 123.91 (SD 33.73) hours weekly (72.6% of the week), and 463.82 (SD 156.70) hours monthly (64.4% of the month). Highest-burden spirometry tasks and high-burden active app tasks had the lowest adherence, engagement, and retention, followed by low-burden questionnaires. Spirometry and active questionnaires had the lowest retention at 0.5 survival probability, indicating that they were the most burdensome. Adherence to and quality of home spirometry were analyzed; of the 7200 sessions requested, 4248 (59%) were performed. Of these, 90.3% (3836/4248) were of acceptable quality according to American Thoracic Society grading. Inclusion of protocol holidays improved retention measures. The technologies used were generally well received. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide evidence supporting the feasibility and acceptability of remote monitoring for capturing both subjective and objective data from various sources for respiratory diseases. The high engagement level observed with passively collected data suggests the potential of wearables for long-term, user-friendly remote monitoring in respiratory disease management. The unique piloting of certain features such as protocol holidays, alert notifications for missing data, and flexible support from the study team provides a reference for future studies in this field.

We derived and validated an arteriovenous fistula failure model (AVF-FM) based on machine learning. Methods: The AVF-FM is an XG-Boost algorithm aimed at predicting AVF failure within three months among in-centre dialysis patients. The model was trained in the derivation set (70% of initial cohort) by exploiting the information routinely collected in the Nephrocare European Clinical Database (EuCliD(®)). Model performance was tested by concordance statistic and calibration charts in the remaining 30% of records. Features importance was computed using the SHAP method. Results: We included 13,369 patients, overall. The Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC) of AVF-FM was 0.80 (95% CI 0.79-0.81). Model calibration showed excellent representation of observed failure risk. Variables associated with the greatest impact on risk estimates were previous history of AVF complications, followed by access recirculation and other functional parameters including metrics describing temporal pattern of dialysis dose, blood flow, dynamic venous and arterial pressures. Conclusions: The AVF-FM achieved good discrimination and calibration properties by combining routinely collected clinical and sensor data that require no additional effort by healthcare staff. Therefore, it can potentially enable risk-based personalization of AVF surveillance strategies."

The system is based on using a single ultra-wideband (UWB) impulse-radar as a sensing device. Using UWB radars, we aim to recognize a person and some preselected movements without camera-type monitoring. Via the experimental work, we have also demonstrated that, by using a UWB signal, it is possible to detect small chest movements remotely to recognize coughing, for example. In addition, based on statistical data analysis, a person's posture in a room can be recognized in a steady situation. In addition, we implemented a machine learning technique (k-nearest neighbour) to automatically classify a static posture using UWB radar data. Skewness, kurtosis and received power are used in posture classification during the postprocessing. The classification accuracy achieved is more than 99%. In this paper, we also present reliability and fault tolerance analyses for three kinds of UWB radar network architectures to point out the weakest item in the installation. This information is highly important in the system's implementation."

Various stakeholders worldwide use ICTs, including individuals, non-profit organizations, health practitioners, and governments. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, ICT has improved the quality of healthcare, the exchange of information, training of healthcare professionals and patients, and facilitated the relationship between patients and healthcare providers. This study systematically reviews the literature on ICT-based automatic and remote monitoring methods, as well as different ICT techniques used in the care of COVID-19-infected patients. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this systematic literature review is to identify the e-Health methods, associated ICTs, method implementation strategies, information collection techniques, advantages, and disadvantages of remote and automatic patient monitoring and care in COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The search included primary studies that were published between January 2020 and June 2022 in scientific and electronic databases, such as EBSCOhost, Scopus, ACM, Nature, SpringerLink, IEEE Xplore, MEDLINE, Google Scholar, JMIR, Web of Science, Science Direct, and PubMed. In this review, the findings from the included publications are presented and elaborated according to the identified research questions. Evidence-based systematic reviews and meta-analyses were conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework. Additionally, we improved the review process using the Rayyan tool and the Scale for the Assessment of Narrative Review Articles (SANRA). Among the eligibility criteria were methodological rigor, conceptual clarity, and useful implementation of ICTs in e-Health for remote and automatic monitoring of COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Our initial search identified 664 potential studies; 102 were assessed for eligibility in the pre-final stage and 65 articles were used in the final review with the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The review identified the following eHealth methods-Telemedicine, Mobile Health (mHealth), and Telehealth. The associated ICTs are Wearable Body Sensors, Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms, Internet-of-Things, or Internet-of-Medical-Things (IoT or IoMT), Biometric Monitoring Technologies (BioMeTs), and Bluetooth-enabled (BLE) home health monitoring devices. Spatial or positional data, personal and individual health, and wellness data, including vital signs, symptoms, biomedical images and signals, and lifestyle data are examples of information that is managed by ICTs. Different AI and IoT methods have opened new possibilities for automatic and remote patient monitoring with associated advantages and weaknesses. Our findings were represented in a structured manner using a semantic knowledge graph (e.g., ontology model). CONCLUSIONS: Various e-Health methods, related remote monitoring technologies, different approaches, information categories, the adoption of ICT tools for an automatic remote patient monitoring (RPM), advantages and limitations of RMTs in the COVID-19 case are discussed in this review. The use of e-Health during the COVID-19 pandemic illustrates the constraints and possibilities of using ICTs. ICTs are not merely an external tool to achieve definite remote and automatic health monitoring goals; instead, they are embedded in contexts. Therefore, the importance of the mutual design process between ICT and society during the global health crisis has been observed from a social informatics perspective. A global health crisis can be observed as an information crisis (e.g., insufficient information, unreliable information, and inaccessible information); however, this review shows the influence of ICTs on COVID-19 patients' health monitoring and related information collection techniques."

Seismocardiogram (SCG) is now easily accessible owing to the advance of wearable sensor technology. However, SCG biometric has not been widely explored due to the challenging motion artifact removal. In this paper, we design placing the sensors at different body parts under different activities to determine the best sensor location. In addition, we develop SCG noise removal algorithm and utilize machine learning approach to perform biometric authentication tasks. We validate the proposed methods on 20 healthy young adults. The dataset contains acceleration data of sitting, standing, walking, and sitting post-exercise activities with the sensor placed at the wrists, neck, heart and sternum. We demonstrate that vertical and dorsal-ventral SCG near the heart and the sternum produce reliable SCG biometric evidenced by achieving the state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, we present the efficacy of the devised noise removal procedure in the authentication during walking motion.Clinical relevance- A seismocardiography-based biometric authentication system can help serve privacy preserving and reveal cardiovascular functioning information in clinics."

B,10.1039/d1tb01237a [doi],Bokka N; Karhade J; Sahatiya P,Deep learning enabled classification of real-time respiration signals acquired by MoSSe quantum dot-based flexible sensors.,England,"Respiration rate is a vital parameter which is useful for the earlier identification of diseases. In this context, various types of devices have been fabricated and developed to monitor different breath rates. However, the disposability and biocompatibility of such sensors and the poor classification of different breath rates from sensor data are significant issues in medical services. This report attempts to focus on two important things: the classification of respiration signals from sensor data using deep learning and the disposability of devices. The use of the novel Janus MoSSe quantum dot (MoSSe QD) structure allows for stable respiration sensing because of unchanged wear rates under humid conditions, and also, the electron affinity and work function values suggest that MoSSe has a higher tendency to donate electrons and interact with the hydrogen molecule. Furthermore, for the real-time classification of different respiration signals, a 1D convolutional neural network (1D CNN) was incorporated. This algorithm was applied to four different breath patterns which achieved a state-of-the-art 10-trial accuracy of 98.18% for normal, 95.25% for slow, 97.64% for deep, and 98.18% for fast breaths. The successful demonstration of a stable, low-cost, and disposable respiration sensor with a highly accurate classification of signals is a major step ahead in developing wearable respiration sensors for future personal healthcare monitoring systems."

Remotely monitored wearable devices and sensors provide precise, objective, and frequent measures of motor and non-motor symptoms. Here, we used consumer-grade wearable device and sensor data from the WATCH-PD study to develop a PD screening tool aimed at eliminating the gap between patient symptoms and diagnosis. Early-stage PD patients (n = 82) and age-matched comparison participants (n = 50) completed a multidomain assessment battery during a one-year longitudinal multicenter study. Using disease- and behavior-relevant feature engineering and multivariate machine learning modeling of early-stage PD status, we developed a highly accurate (92.3%), sensitive (90.0%), and specific (100%) random forest classification model (AUC = 0.92) that performed well across environmental and platform contexts. These findings provide robust support for further exploration of consumer-grade wearable devices and sensors for global population-wide PD screening and surveillance."

Medical infrastructure, which for decades sought to reduce the incidence and severity of communicable diseases, has proven insufficient in meeting the intensive, long-term monitoring needs of many NCD disease patient groups. In addition, existing portable devices with rigid electronics are still limited in clinical use due to unreliable data, limited functionality, and lack of continuous measurement ability. Here, a wearable system for at-home cardiovascular monitoring of postpartum women-a group with urgently unmet NCD needs in the United States-using a cloud-integrated soft sternal device with conformal nanomembrane sensors is introduced. A supporting mobile application provides device data to a custom cloud architecture for real-time waveform analytics, including medical device-grade blood pressure prediction via deep learning, and shares the results with both patient and clinician to complete a robust and highly scalable remote monitoring ecosystem. Validated in a month-long clinical study with 20 postpartum Black women, the system demonstrates its ability to remotely monitor existing disease progression, stratify patient risk, and augment clinical decision-making by informing interventions for groups whose healthcare needs otherwise remain unmet in standard clinical practice."

Triaging and prioritizing patients becomes particularly challenging especially for the patients who are far from hospital and use telemedicine system. To this end, the researchers exploiting the useful tool of machine learning to address this challenge. Hence, carrying out an intensive investigation and in-depth study in the field of using machine learning in E-triage and patient priority are essential and required. OBJECTIVES: This research aims to (1) provide a literature review and an in-depth study on the roles of machine learning in the fields of electronic emergency triage (E-triage) and prioritize patients for fast healthcare services in telemedicine applications.

We have searched all related keywords to investigate the databases of Science Direct, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, PubMed, and Medline for the articles, which have been published from January 2012 up to date. RESULTS: A new crossover matching between machine learning methods and telemedicine taxonomy is proposed. The crossover-taxonomy is developed in this study to identify the relationship between machine learning algorithm and the equivalent telemedicine categories whereas the machine learning algorithm has been utilized. The impact of utilizing machine learning is composed in proposing the telemedicine architecture based on synchronous (real-time/ online) and asynchronous (store-and-forward / offline) structure. In addition to that, list of machine learning algorithms, list of the performance metrics, list of inputs data and outputs results are presented. Moreover, open research challenges, the benefits of utilizing machine learning and the recommendations for new research opportunities that need to be addressed for the synergistic integration of multidisciplinary works are organized and presented accordingly. DISCUSSION: The state-of-the-art studies on the E-triage and priority systems that utilise machine learning algorithms in telemedicine architecture are discussed. This approach allows the researchers to understand the modernisation of healthcare systems and the efficient use of artificial intelligence and machine learning. In particular, the growing worldwide population and various chronic diseases such as heart chronic diseases, blood pressure and diabetes, require smart health monitoring systems in E-triage and priority systems, in which machine learning algorithms could be greatly beneficial. CONCLUSIONS: Although research directions on E-triage and priority systems that use machine learning algorithms in telemedicine vary, they are equally essential and should be considered. Hence, we provide a comprehensive review to emphasise the advantages of the existing research in multidisciplinary works of artificial intelligence, machine learning and healthcare services."

This is due to the convergence of various advancements related to digitalization and the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs)-ranging from the internet of things (IoT) and the internet of medical things (IoMT) to the fields of robotics, virtual and augmented reality, and massively parallel and cloud computing. Further progress has been made in the fields of addictive manufacturing and three-dimensional (3D) printing, sophisticated statistical tools such as big data visualization and analytics (BDVA) and artificial intelligence (AI), the use of mobile and smartphone applications (apps), remote monitoring and wearable sensors, and e-learning, among others.

However, no review has explored the landscape of smart home technologies that aim to promote physical activity and independent living among a wide range of age groups. OBJECTIVE: This review aims to map published studies on smart home technologies aimed at promoting physical activity among the general and aging populations to unveil the state of the art, its potential, and the research gaps and opportunities. METHODS: Articles were retrieved from 6 databases (PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, ACM Library, and Web of Science). The criteria for inclusion were that the articles must be user studies that dealt with smart home or Active Assisted Living technologies and physical activity, were written in English, and were published in peer-reviewed journals. In total, 3 researchers independently and collaboratively assessed the eligibility of the retrieved articles and elicited the relevant data and findings using tables and charts. RESULTS: This review synthesized 20 articles that met the inclusion criteria, 70% (14/20) of which were conducted between 2018 and 2020. Three-quarters of the studies (15/20, 75%) were conducted in Western countries, with the United States accounting for 25% (5/20). Activities of daily living were the most studied (9/20, 45%), followed by physical activity (6/20, 30%), therapeutic exercise (4/20, 20%), and bodyweight exercise (1/20, 5%). K-nearest neighbor and naïve Bayes classifier were the most used machine learning algorithms for activity recognition, with at least 10% (2/20) of the studies using either algorithm. Ambient and wearable technologies were equally studied (8/20, 40% each), followed by robots (3/20, 15%). Activity recognition was the most common goal of the evaluated smart home technologies, with 55% (11/20) of the studies reporting it, followed by activity monitoring (7/20, 35%). Most studies (8/20, 40%) were conducted in a laboratory setting. Moreover, 25% (5/20) and 10% (2/20) were conducted in a home and hospital setting, respectively. Finally, 75% (15/20) had a positive outcome, 15% (3/20) had a mixed outcome, and 10% (2/20) had an indeterminate outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that smart home technologies, especially digital personal assistants, coaches, and robots, are effective in promoting physical activity among the young population. Although only few studies were identified among the older population, smart home technologies hold bright prospects in assisting and aiding older people to age in place and function independently, especially in Western countries, where there are shortages of long-term care workers. Hence, there is a need to do more work (eg, cross-cultural studies and randomized controlled trials) among the growing aging population on the effectiveness and acceptance of smart home technologies that aim to promote physical activity."

With advancements in remote monitoring and Artificial Intelligence, automatic tele-rehabilitation systems that can measure joint angles, recognize exercises, and provide feedback based on movement analysis are being developed. Such platforms can offer valuable information to clinicians for improved care planning. However, with various methods and sensors being used, understanding their pros, cons, and performance is important. This paper reviews and compares the performance of recent vision-based, wearable, and pressure-sensing technologies used in lower limb tele-rehabilitation systems over the past 10 years (from 2014 to 2023). We selected studies that were published in English and focused on joint angle estimation, activity recognition, and exercise assessment. Vision-based approaches were the most common, accounting for 42% of studies. Wearable technology followed at approximately 37%, and pressure-sensing technology appeared in 21% of studies. Identified gaps include a lack of uniformity in reported performance metrics and evaluation methods, a need for cross-subject validation, inadequate testing with patients and older adults, restricted sets of exercises evaluated, and a scarcity of comprehensive datasets on lower limb exercises, especially those involving movements while lying down."

Artificial intelligence-based neural networks are promising technologies for automatically detecting lung nodules employing patient monitoring data acquired from sensor technology through an Internet-of-Things (IoT)-based patient monitoring system. However, the standard neural networks rely on manually acquired features, which reduces the effectiveness of detection. In this paper, we provide a novel IoT-enabled healthcare monitoring platform and an improved grey-wolf optimization (IGWO)-based deep convulution neural network (DCNN) model for lung cancer detection. The Tasmanian Devil Optimization (TDO) algorithm is utilized to select the most pertinent features for diagnosing lung nodules, and the convergence rate of the standard grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm is modified, resulting in an improved GWO algorithm. Consequently, an IGWO-based DCNN is trained on the optimal features obtained from the IoT platform, and the findings are saved in the cloud for the doctor's judgment. The model is built on an Android platform with DCNN-enabled Python libraries, and the findings are evaluated against cutting-edge lung cancer detection models."

For instance, healthcare, transport, and shopping applications are designed on the basis of the mobile cloud. For executing mobile-cloud applications, offloading and scheduling are fundamental mechanisms. However, mobile healthcare workflow applications with these methods are widely ignored, demanding applications in various aspects for healthcare monitoring, live healthcare service, and biomedical firms. However, these offloading and scheduling schemes do not consider the workflow applications' execution in their models. This paper develops a lightweight secure efficient offloading scheduling (LSEOS) metaheuristic model. LSEOS consists of light weight, and secure offloading and scheduling methods whose execution offloading delay is less than that of existing methods. The objective of LSEOS is to run workflow applications on other nodes and minimize the delay and security risk in the system. The metaheuristic LSEOS consists of the following components: adaptive deadlines, sorting, and scheduling with neighborhood search schemes. Compared to current strategies for delay and security validation in a model, computational results revealed that the LSEOS outperformed all available offloading and scheduling methods for process applications by 10% security ratio and by 29% regarding delays."

Patient comfort and willingness to participate in such efforts is a prominent factor for their adoption. As IoT technology has provided solutions for all technical issues, patient concerns are those that seem to restrict their wider adoption. To enhance patient awareness of the system properties and enhance their willingness to adopt IoMT solutions, this paper presents a novel methodology to integrate patient concerns in the design requirements of such systems. It comprises a number of straightforward steps that an IoMT designer can follow, starting from identifying patient concerns, incorporating them in system design requirements as criticalities, proceeding to system implementation and testing, and finally, verifying that it fulfills the concerns of the patients. To showcase the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, the paper applies it in the design and implementation of a fall detection system for elderly patients remotely monitored in their homes."

IoT-based healthcare has a significant impact on real-time remote monitoring of patients' health and consequently improving treatments and reducing healthcare costs. In fact, IoT has made healthcare more reliable, efficient, and accessible. Two major drawbacks which IoT suffers from can be expressed as: first, thelimited battery capacityof thesensorsis quickly depleted due to the continuous stream of data; second, the dependence of the system on the cloud for computations and processing causes latency in data transmission which is not accepted in real-time monitoring applications. This research is conducted to develop a real-time, secure, and energy-efficient platform which provides a solution for reducing computation load on the cloud and diminishing data transmission delay. In the proposed platform, the sensors utilize a state-of-the-art power saving technique known as Compressive Sensing (CS). CS allows sensors to retrieve the sensed data using fewer measurements by sending a compressed signal. In this framework, the signal reconstruction and processing are computed locally on a Heterogeneous Multicore Platform (HMP) device to decrease the dependency on the cloud. In addition, a framework has been implemented to control the system, set different parameters, display the data as well as send live notifications to medical experts through the cloud in order to alert them of any eventual hazardous event or abnormality and allow quick interventions. Finally, a case study of the system is presented demonstrating the acquisition and monitoring of the data for a given subject in real-time. The obtained results reveal that the proposed solution reduces 15.4% of energy consumption in sensors, that makes this prototype a good candidate for IoT employment in healthcare."

The National Institutes of Health called on digital health leaders to contribute to a high-quality data repository that will support researchers to make discoveries that are otherwise not possible with small, limited data sets. OBJECTIVE: To this end, we seek to develop a COVID-19 digital biomarker for early detection of physiological exacerbation or decompensation. We propose the development and validation of a COVID-19 decompensation Index (CDI) in a 2-phase study that builds on existing wearable biosensor-derived analytics generated by physIQ's end-to-end cloud platform for continuous physiological monitoring with wearable biosensors. This effort serves to achieve two primary objectives: (1) to collect adequate data to help develop the CDI and (2) to collect rich deidentified clinical data correlating with outcomes and symptoms related to COVID-19 progression. Our secondary objectives include evaluation of the feasibility and usability of pinpointIQ, a digital platform through which data are gathered, analyzed, and displayed. METHODS: This is a prospective, nonrandomized, open-label, 2-phase study. Phase I will involve data collection for the digital data hub of the National Institutes of Health as well as data to support the preliminary development of the CDI. Phase II will involve data collection for the hub and contribute to continued refinement and validation of the CDI. While this study will focus on the development of a CDI, the digital platform will also be evaluated for feasibility and usability while clinicians deliver care to continuously monitored patients enrolled in the study. RESULTS: Our target CDI will be a binary classifier trained to distinguish participants with and those without decompensation. The primary performance metric for CDI will be the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve with a minimum performance criterion of ≥0.75 (α=.05; power [1-β]=0.80). Furthermore, we will determine the sex or gender and race or ethnicity of the participants, which would account for differences in the CDI performance, as well as the lead time-time to predict decompensation-and its relationship with the ultimate disease severity based on the World Health Organization COVID-19 ordinal scale. CONCLUSIONS: Using machine learning techniques on a large data set of patients with COVID-19 could provide valuable insights into the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and a digital biomarker for COVID-19 decompensation. Through this study, we intend to develop a tool that can uniquely reflect physiological data of a diverse population and contribute to high-quality data that will help researchers better understand COVID-19.

A wearable ECG patch was designed to collect ECG signals and send the signals to an Android smartphone via Bluetooth. An Android APP was developed to display the ECG waveforms in real time and transmit every 30 s ECG data to a remote cloud server. A machine learning (CatBoost)-based ECG classification method was proposed to detect AF in the cloud server. In case of detected AF, the cloud server pushed the ECG data and classification results to the web browser of a doctor. Finally, the Android APP displayed the doctor's diagnosis for the ECG signals. Experimental results showed the proposed CatBoost classifier trained with 17 selected features achieved an overall F(1) score of 0.92 on the test set (n = 7,270). The proposed wearable ECG monitoring system may potentially be useful for long-term ECG telemonitoring for AF detection."

Wearability is essential while collecting data from a human, who should be able to wear the device with sufficient comfort. In this study, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and silver nanowires (AgNWs) were supersonically sprayed onto a fabric to ensure good adhesiveness, resulting in a washable, stretchable, and wearable fabric without affecting the performance of the designed features. This rGO/AgNW-decorated fabric can be used to monitor external stimuli such as strain and temperature. In addition, it is used as a heater and as a supercapacitor and features an antibacterial hydrophobic surface that minimizes potential infection from external airborne viruses or virus-containing droplets. Herein, the wearability, stretchability, washability, mechanical durability, temperature-sensing capability, heating ability, wettability, and antibacterial features of this metallized fabric are explored. This multifunctionality is achieved in a single fabric coated with rGO/AgNWs via supersonic spraying."

The physical health and well-being of the elderly population are affected by their level of physical activity. Therefore, monitoring daily activities can help improve the quality of life. This becomes especially a huge challenge for those, who suffer from dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Thus, it is of great importance for personnel in care homes/rehabilitation centers to monitor their daily activities and progress. Unlike normal subjects, it is required to place the sensor on the back of this group of patients, which makes it even more challenging to detect walking from other activities. With the latest advancements in the field of health sensing and sensor technology, a huge amount of accelerometer data can be easily collected. In this study, a Machine Learning (ML) based algorithm was developed to analyze the accelerometer data collected from patients with walking difficulties, who live in one of the municipalities in Denmark. The ML algorithm is capable of accurately classifying the walking activity of these individuals with different walking abnormalities. Various statistical, temporal, and spectral features were extracted from the time series data collected using an accelerometer sensor placed on the back of the participants. The back sensor placement is desirable in patients with dementia and Alzheimer's disease since they may remove visible sensors to them due to the nature of their diseases. Then, an evolutionary optimization algorithm called Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) was used to select a subset of features to be used in the classification step. Four different ML classifiers such as k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Random Forest (RF), Stacking Classifier (Stack), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) were trained and compared on an accelerometry dataset consisting of 20 participants. These models were evaluated using the leave-one-group-out cross-validation (LOGO-CV) technique. The Stack model achieved the best performance with average sensitivity, positive predictive values (precision), F(1)-score, and accuracy of 86.85%, 93.25%, 88.81%, and 93.32%, respectively, to classify walking episodes. In general, the empirical results confirmed that the proposed models are capable of classifying the walking episodes despite the challenging sensor placement on the back of the patients, who suffer from walking disabilities."

This raises a pertinent question: which devices and parameters perform best in exacerbation detection? METHODS: A total of 149 patients with asthma (90 children, 59 adults) participated in a 6-month observational study. Participants (or parents) regularly (daily for the first 2 weeks and weekly for the next 5.5 months, with increased frequency during exacerbations) performed self-examinations using 3 devices: an artificial intelligence (AI)-aided home stethoscope (providing wheezes, rhonchi, and coarse and fine crackles intensity; respiratory and heart rate; and inspiration-to-expiration ratio), a peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) meter, and a peak expiratory flow (PEF) meter and filled out a health state survey. The resulting 6,029 examinations were evaluated by physicians for the presence of exacerbations. For each registered parameter, a machine learning model was trained, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated to assess its utility in exacerbation detection. RESULTS: The best single-parameter discriminators of exacerbations were wheezes intensity for young children (AUC 84% [95% CI, 82%-85%]), rhonchi intensity for older children (AUC 81% [95% CI, 79%-84%]), and survey answers for adults (AUC 92% [95% CI, 89%-95%]). The greatest efficacy (in terms of AUC) was observed for a combination of several parameters. CONCLUSIONS: The AI-aided home stethoscope provides reliable information on asthma exacerbations. The parameters provided are effective for children, especially those younger than 5 years of age. The introduction of this tool to the health care system might enhance asthma exacerbation detection substantially and make remote monitoring of patients easier."

The multi-source mixed-frequency health data overwhelm the modeling capacity of existing statistical and machine learning models, due to many challenging properties. Although predictive analytics for big health data plays an important role in telemonitoring, there is a lack of rigorous prediction model that can automatically predicts patients' health conditions, e.g., Disease Severity Indicators (DSIs), from multi-source mixed-frequency data. Sleep disorder is a prevalent cardiac syndrome that is characterized by abnormal respiratory patterns during sleep. Although wearable devices are available to administrate sleep studies at home, the manual scoring process to generate the DSI remains a bottleneck in automated monitoring and diagnosis of sleep disorder. To address the multi-fold challenges for precise prediction of the DSI from high-dimensional multi-source mixed-frequency data in sleep disorder, we propose a sparse linear mixed model that combines the modified Cholesky decomposition with group lasso penalties to enable joint group selection of fixed effects and random effects. A novel Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm integrated with an efficient Majorization Maximization (MM) algorithm is developed for model estimation of the proposed sparse linear mixed model with group variable selection. The proposed method was applied to the SHHS data for telemonitoring and diagnosis of sleep disorder and found that a few significant feature groups that are consistent with prior medical studies on sleep disorder. The proposed method also outperformed a few benchmark methods with the highest prediction accuracy."

Machine learning allows to automate sleep stage classification, but trust and reliability issues have hampered its adoption in clinical applications. Estimating uncertainty is a crucial factor in enhancing reliability by identifying regions of heightened and diminished confidence. In this study, we used an uncertainty-centred machine learning pipeline, U-PASS, to automate sleep staging in a challenging real-world dataset of single-channel electroencephalography and accelerometry collected with a wearable device from an elderly population. We were able to effectively limit the uncertainty of our machine learning model and to reliably inform clinical experts of which predictions were uncertain to improve the machine learning model's reliability. This increased the five-stage sleep-scoring accuracy of a state-of-the-art machine learning model from 63.9% to 71.2% on our dataset. Remarkably, the machine learning approach outperformed the human expert in interpreting these wearable data. Manual review by sleep specialists, without specific training for sleep staging on wearable electroencephalography, proved ineffective. The clinical utility of this automated remote monitoring system was also demonstrated, establishing a strong correlation between the predicted sleep parameters and the reference polysomnography parameters, and reproducing known correlations with the apnea-hypopnea index. In essence, this work presents a promising avenue to revolutionize remote patient care through the power of machine learning by the use of an automated data-processing pipeline enhanced with uncertainty estimation."

Older adults, including people with dementia, want to live independently and feel in control of their lives for as long as possible. Assistive technologies powered by artificial intelligence and internet of things devices are being proposed to provide living environments that support the users' safety, psychological, and medical needs through remote monitoring and interventions. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the functional, psychosocial, and environmental needs of people living with dementia, their caregivers, clinicians, and health and social care service providers toward the design and implementation of smart home systems. METHODS: We used an iterative user-centered design approach comprising 9 substudies. First, semistructured interviews (9 people with dementia, 9 caregivers, and 10 academic and clinical staff) and workshops (35 pairs of people with dementia and caregivers, and 12 health and social care clinicians) were conducted to define the needs of people with dementia, home caregivers, and professional stakeholders in both daily activities and technology-specific interactions. Then, the spectrum of needs identified was represented via patient-caregiver personas and discussed with stakeholders in a workshop (14 occupational therapists; 4 National Health Service pathway directors; and 6 researchers in occupational therapy, neuropsychiatry, and engineering) and 2 focus groups with managers of health care services (n=8), eliciting opportunities for innovative care technologies and public health strategies. Finally, these design opportunities were discussed in semistructured interviews with participants of a smart home trial involving environmental sensors, physiological measurement devices, smartwatches, and tablet-based chatbots and cognitive assessment puzzles (10 caregivers and 2 people with dementia). A thematic analysis revealed factors that motivate household members to use these technologies. RESULTS: Outcomes of these activities include a qualitative and quantitative analysis of patient, caregiver, and clinician needs and the identification of challenges and opportunities for the design and implementation of remote monitoring systems in public health pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Participatory design methods supported the triangulation of stakeholder perspectives to aid the development of more patient-centered interventions and their translation to clinical practice and public health strategy. We discuss the implications and limitations of our findings, the value and the applicability of our methodology, and directions for future research."

For this information to be interpretable, machine learning (ML) processes are necessary. RESEARCH QUESTION: Can a machine learning model successfully identify patients expected to have low gait speed in the early recovery period following joint replacement surgery? METHODS: A commercial database from a smartphone-based care management platform passively collecting mobility data pre- and post-lower limb arthroplasty was used. We sought to create a ML model to predict gait speed recovery curves and identify patients at risk of poor gait speed outcome, a measure associated with range of motion and patient-reported outcomes. Model performance including sensitivity, specificity, precision, and accuracy were determined. Receiver operator curve (ROC) analysis was used to compare true and false positive rates. To benchmark our model, we compared threshold-based notifications based on the patient's current gait speed. RESULTS: The performance of the predictive model was significantly improved compared to baseline of threshold-based exceptions using current gait speed. The ML model currently provides 53 % precision, 88 % accuracy, 36 % sensitivity, and 95 % specificity on the held-out test set. The ROC analysis suggests good clinical performance (AUC=0.81). SIGNIFICANCE: Utilization of ML to predict gait recovery following total joint replacement is feasible and provides results with excellent specificity. This model will allow inclusion of additional data for retraining as patient populations evolve. Clinician feedback regarding notifications, including resulting actions and outcomes, can be used to further inform the model and improve clinical utility."

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the efficacy of an artificial intelligence-based heart failure detection model for peripartum cardiomyopathy detection. STUDY DESIGN: We first built a deep-learning model for heart failure detection using retrospective data at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center. Cases were adult and nonpregnant female patients with a heart failure diagnosis; controls were adult nonpregnant female patients without heart failure. The model was then tested on an independent cohort of pregnant women at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center with or without peripartum cardiomyopathy. We also tested the model in an external cohort of pregnant women at Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist. Key outcomes were assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. We also repeated our analysis using only lead I electrocardiogram as an input to assess the feasibility of remote monitoring via wearables that can capture single-lead electrocardiogram data. RESULTS: The University of Tennessee Health Science Center heart failure cohort comprised 346,339 electrocardiograms from 142,601 patients. In this cohort, 60% of participants were Black and 37% were White, with an average age (standard deviation) of 53 (19) years. The heart failure detection model achieved an area under the curve of 0.92 on the holdout set. We then tested the ability of the heart failure model to detect peripartum cardiomyopathy in an independent University of Tennessee Health Science Center cohort of pregnant women and an external Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist cohort of pregnant women. The independent University of Tennessee Health Science Center cohort included 158 electrocardiograms from 115 patients; our deep-learning model achieved an area under the curve of 0.83 (0.77-0.89) for this data set. The external Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist cohort involved 80 electrocardiograms from 43 patients; our deep-learning model achieved an area under the curve of 0.94 (0.91-0.98) for this data set. For identifying peripartum cardiomyopathy diagnosed ≥10 days after delivery, the model achieved an area under the curve of 0.88 (0.81-0.94) for the University of Tennessee Health Science Center cohort and of 0.96 (0.93-0.99) for the Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist cohort. When we repeated our analysis by building a heart failure detection model using only lead-I electrocardiograms, we obtained similarly high detection accuracies, with areas under the curve of 0.73 and 0.93 for the University of Tennessee Health Science Center and Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist cohorts, respectively. CONCLUSION: Artificial intelligence can accurately detect peripartum cardiomyopathy from electrocardiograms alone. A simple electrocardiographic artificial intelligence-based peripartum screening could result in a timelier diagnosis. Given that results with 1-lead electrocardiogram data were similar to those obtained using all 12 leads, future studies will focus on remote screening for peripartum cardiomyopathy using smartwatches that can capture single-lead electrocardiogram data."

While standardized neuropsychological tests are inconvenient for this purpose, wearable sensor technology collecting physiological and behavioral data looks promising to provide proxy measures of cognitive function. The objective of this study was to evaluate the predictive ability of digital physiological features, based on sensor data from wrist-worn wearables, in determining neuropsychological test scores in individuals with MCI. METHODS: We used the dataset collected from a 10-week single-arm clinical trial in older adults (50-70 years old) diagnosed with amnestic MCI (N = 30) who received a digitally delivered multidomain therapeutic intervention. Cognitive performance was assessed before and after the intervention using the Neuropsychological Test Battery (NTB) from which composite scores were calculated (executive function, processing speed, immediate memory, delayed memory and global cognition). The Empatica E4, a wrist-wearable medical-grade device, was used to collect physiological data including blood volume pulse, electrodermal activity, and skin temperature. We processed sensors' data and extracted a range of physiological features. We used interpolated NTB scores for 10-day intervals to test predictability of scores over short periods and to leverage the maximum of wearable data available. In addition, we used individually centered data which represents deviations from personal baselines. Supervised machine learning was used to train models predicting NTB scores from digital physiological features and demographics. Performance was evaluated using ""leave-one-subject-out"" and ""leave-one-interval-out"" cross-validation. RESULTS: The final sample included 96 aggregated data intervals from 17 individuals. In total, 106 digital physiological features were extracted. We found that physiological features, especially measures of heart rate variability, correlated most strongly to the executive function compared to other cognitive composites. The model predicted the actual executive function scores with correlation r = 0.69 and intra-individual changes in executive function scores with r = 0.61. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated that wearable-based physiological measures, primarily HRV, have potential to be used for the continuous assessments of cognitive function in individuals with MCI."

The integration of innovative technologies, such as the Internet of Things, wearable technologies, artificial intelligence, and ambient-assisted living applications, represents a valuable solution for this scope. Designing such an integrated system requires addressing several aspects (eg, equipment selection, data management, analytics, costs, and users' needs) and involving different areas of expertise (eg, medical science, service design, biomedical and computer engineering). OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is 2-fold; we aimed to design the functionalities of a smart health platform addressing 5 chronic conditions prevalent in the older population (ie, hearing loss, cardiovascular diseases, cognitive impairments, mental health problems, and balance disorders) by considering both older adults' and clinicians' perspectives and to evaluate the identified smart health platform functionalities with a small group of older adults. METHODS: Overall, 24 older adults (aged >65 years) and 118 clinicians were interviewed through focus group activities and web-based questionnaires to elicit the smart health platform requirements. Considering the elicited requirements, the main functionalities of smart health platform were designed. Then, a focus group involving 6 older adults was conducted to evaluate the proposed solution in terms of usefulness, credibility, desirability, and learnability. RESULTS: Eight main functionalities were identified and assessed-cognitive training and hearing training (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 6/6, 100%; learnability: 6/6, 100%), monitoring of physiological parameters (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 6/6, 100%; learnability: 5/6, 83%), physical training (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 5/6, 83%; learnability: 2/6, 33%), psychoeducational intervention (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 4/6, 67%; learnability: 2/6, 33%), mood monitoring (usefulness: 4/6, 67%; credibility: 4/6, 67%; desirability: 3/6, 50%; learnability: 5/6, 50%), diet plan (usefulness: 5/6, 83%; credibility: 4/6, 67%; desirability: 1/6, 17%; learnability: 2/6, 33%), and environment monitoring and adjustment (usefulness: 1/6, 17%; credibility: 1/6, 17%; desirability: 0/6, 0%; learnability: 0/6, 0%). Most of them were highly appreciated by older participants, with the only exception being environment monitoring and adjustment. The results showed that the proposed functionalities met the needs and expectations of users (eg, improved self-management of patients' disease and enhanced patient safety). However, some aspects need to be addressed (eg, technical and privacy issues). CONCLUSIONS: The presented smart health platform functionalities seem to be able to meet older adults' needs and desires to enhance their self-awareness and self-management of their medical condition, encourage healthy and independent living, and provide evidence-based support for clinicians' decision-making. Further research with a larger and more heterogeneous pool of stakeholders in terms of demographics and clinical conditions is needed to assess system acceptability and overall user experience in free-living conditions."

To mimic and surpass the high-gauge-factor sensing properties of human skin, structure design and appropriate material selection of sensors are both essentially required. Here, we present an efficient, low-cost fabrication strategy to construct an ultra-highly sensitive, flexible pressure sensor by embedding the aligned nickel-coated carbon fibers (NICFs) in a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate. Our design substantially contributes to ultrahigh sensitivity through the parallel circuit formed by aligned NICFs as well as surface spinosum microstructure molded by sandpaper. As a result, the sensor exhibits excellent sensitivity (15 525 kPa(-1)), a fast response time (30 ms), and good stability over 3000 loading-unloading cycles. Furthermore, these superior sensing properties trigger applications in water quality and wave monitoring in conjunction with mechanical flexibility and robustness. As a precedent for adjusting the sensitivities of the sensor, the NICFs/PDMS sensor provides a promising method for multiscenario healthcare monitoring, multiscale pressure spatial distribution, and human-machine interfacing."

Bespoke subject-specific treatment (medication or deep brain stimulation (DBS)) is critical for management, yet depends on precise assessment cardinal PD symptoms - bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor. Clinician diagnosis is the basis of treatment, yet it allows only a cross-sectional assessment of symptoms which can vary on an hourly basis and is liable to inter- and intra-rater subjectivity across human examiners. Automated symptomatic assessment has attracted significant interest to optimise treatment regimens between clinician visits, however, no wearable has the capacity to simultaneously assess all three cardinal symptoms. Challenges in the measurement of rigidity, mapping muscle activity out-of-clinic and sensor fusion have inhibited translation. In this study, we address all through a novel wearable sensor system and machine learning algorithms. The sensor system is composed of a force-sensor, three inertial measurement units (IMUs) and four custom mechanomyography (MMG) sensors. The system was tested in its capacity to predict Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores based on quantitative assessment of bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor in PD patients. 23 PD patients were tested with the sensor system in parallel with exams conducted by treating clinicians and 10 healthy subjects were recruited as a comparison control group. Results prove the system accurately predicts UPDRS scores for all symptoms (85.4% match on average with physician assessment) and discriminates between healthy subjects and PD patients (96.6% on average). MMG features can also be used for remote monitoring of severity and fluctuations in PD symptoms out-of-clinic. This closed-loop feedback system enables individually tailored and regularly updated treatment, facilitating better outcomes for a very large patient population."

For that, an enhanced deep learning network using Bayes theorem (EDLN-BT) benefits to obtain and verify various patient health data in a specific aspect, making it easy to supervise the patient's activities. RESULTS: The IoT-IMM-based EDLN-BT results show the smart health care monitoring has undergone substantial growth, improving patient satisfaction for the quality of the healthcare services offered in hospitals and many other healthcare facilities. It helps predict health diseases with increased accuracy, prediction rate with minimal residual error delay, and energy consumption."

Exponential rise in future Radio-Frequency (RF) sensing systems have demonstrated its applications in areas such as wearable consumer electronics, remote healthcare monitoring, wireless implants, and smart buildings. In this paper, we propose a novel, non-wearable, device-free, privacy-preserving Wi-Fi imaging-based occupancy detection system for future smart buildings. The proposed system is developed using off-the-shelf non-wearable devices such as Wi-Fi router, network interface card, and an omnidirectional antenna for future body centric communication. The core idea is to detect presence of person along its activities of daily living without deploying a device on person's body. The Wi-Fi signals received using non-wearable devices are converted into time-frequency scalograms. The occupancy is detected by classifying the scalogram images using an auto-encoder neural network. In addition to occupancy detection, the deep neural network also identifies the activity performed by the occupant. Moreover, a novel encryption algorithm using Chirikov and Intertwining map-based is also proposed to encrypt the scalogram images. This feature enables secure storage of scalogram images in a database for future analysis. The classification accuracy of the proposed scheme is 91.1%."

Epilepsy, a chronic brain syndrome characterized by recurrent, unpredictable attacks, affects individuals of all ages. IoT-based seizure monitoring can greatly enhance seizure patients' quality of life. IoT device acquires patient data and transmits it to a computer program so that doctors can examine it. Currently, doctors invest significant manual effort in inspecting Electroencephalograph (EEG) signals to identify seizure activity. However, EEG-based seizure detection algorithms face challenges in real-world scenarios due to non-stationary EEG data and variable seizure patterns among patients and recording sessions. Therefore, a sophisticated computer-based approach is necessary to analyze complex EEG records. In this work, the authors proposed a hybrid approach by combining traditional convolution neural (CN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) along with an attention mechanism for the automatic recognition of epileptic seizures through EEG signal analysis. This attention mechanism focuses on significant subsets of EEG data for class recognition, resulting in improved model performance. The proposed methods are evaluated using a publicly available UCI epileptic seizure recognition dataset, which consists of five classes: four normal conditions and one abnormal seizure condition. Experimental results demonstrate that the suggested approach achieves an overall accuracy of 97.05% for the five-class EEG recognition data, with an accuracy of 99.52% for binary classification distinguishing seizure cases from normal instances. Furthermore, the proposed intelligent seizure recognition model is compatible with an IoMT (Internet of Medical Things) cloud-based smart healthcare framework."

The rapid growth of IoT technology has revolutionized human life by inaugurating the concept of smart devices, smart healthcare, smart industry, smart city, smart grid, among others. IoT devices' security has become a serious concern nowadays, especially for the healthcare domain, where recent attacks exposed damaging IoT security vulnerabilities. Traditional network security solutions are well established. However, due to the resource constraint property of IoT devices and the distinct behavior of IoT protocols, the existing security mechanisms cannot be deployed directly for securing the IoT devices and network from the cyber-attacks. To enhance the level of security for IoT, researchers need IoT-specific tools, methods, and datasets. To address the mentioned problem, we provide a framework for developing IoT context-aware security solutions to detect malicious traffic in IoT use cases. The proposed framework consists of a newly created, open-source IoT data generator tool named IoT-Flock. The IoT-Flock tool allows researchers to develop an IoT use-case comprised of both normal and malicious IoT devices and generate traffic. Additionally, the proposed framework provides an open-source utility for converting the captured traffic generated by IoT-Flock into an IoT dataset. Using the proposed framework in this research, we first generated an IoT healthcare dataset which comprises both normal and IoT attack traffic. Afterwards, we applied different machine learning techniques to the generated dataset to detect the cyber-attacks and protect the healthcare system from cyber-attacks. The proposed framework will help in developing the context-aware IoT security solutions, especially for a sensitive use case like IoT healthcare environment."

To acquire wearing comfort and high-quality signals, patches with tissue-like softness, elastic recovery, damage tolerance, and robust bioelectronic interface are highly desired yet challenging to achieve. Here, we report a dry epidermal patch made from a supramolecular polymer (SESA) and an in situ transferred carbon nanotubes' percolation network. The polymer possesses a hybrid structure of copolymerized permanent scaffold permeated by multiple dynamic interactions, which imparts a desired mechanical response transition from elastic recoil to energy dissipation with increased elongation. Such SESA-based patches are soft (Young's modulus ∼0.1 MPa) and elastic within physiologically relevant strain levels (97% elastic recovery at 50% tensile strain), intrinsically mechanical-electrical damage-resilient (∼90% restoration from damage after 5 min), and interference-immune in dynamic signal acquisition (stretch, underwater, sweat). We demonstrate its versatile physiological sensing applications, including electrocardiogram recording under various disturbances, machine-learning-enabled hand-gesture recognition through electromyogram measurement, subtle radial artery pulse, and drastic knee kinematics sensing. This epidermal patch offers a promising noninvasive, long-duration, and ambulant bioelectronic interfacing with anti-interference robustness."

Here, as a throwaway waste material, a chewed gum can be reused for the preparation of wearable iontronics simply. A new gum sensor was constructed by regularly stretching a chewed gum in 6 M NaCl aqueous or even a Chinese edible salt solution for increasing the ionic conductivity. This gum sensor can be shaped arbitrarily, and the preparation process is green, pollution-free, with low energy consumption, and repeatable. Herein, this gum sensor can be utilized for real-time human healthcare monitoring effectively (i.e., facial mood changes, finger flexion, long time walking, and continuous ankle movement) and shows a fast response time of 297 ms and a reliable cycling performance in monitoring body motions. Furthermore, the gum sensor (containing edible salt) can act as a signal transmitter for intelligent information encryption and transmission in the light of the international Morse code with excellent repeatability and stability. Hence, this work will greatly possess wide potential application prospects in wearable electronics and information encryption. This gum sensor also provides a ponderable option in the next generation of artificial intelligence devices, which can address the troubles of material selections in sensor preparation."

The study group consisted of 41 STEMI patients and 49 control patients referred for elective coronary angiography and having normal left ventricular function and no valvular heart disease or arrhythmia. MCG signals were recorded on the upper sternum in supine position upon arrival to the catheterization laboratory. In this study, we used a dedicated wearable sensor equipped with 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis gyroscope and 1-lead ECG in order to facilitate the detection of STEMI in a clinically meaningful way. A supervised machine learning approach was used. Stability of beat morphology, signal strength, maximum amplitude and its timing were calculated in six axes from each window with varying band-pass filters in 2-90 Hz range. In total, 613 features were investigated.

Current diagnosis relies on subjective lung auscultation by physicians. Enabling this capability via a low-profile, objective wearable device for remote patient monitoring (RPM) could offer pre-emptive, accurate respiratory data to patients. With this goal as our aim, we used a low-profile accelerometer-based wearable system that utilizes deep learning to objectively detect wheezing along with respiration rate using a single sensor. The miniature patch consists of a sensitive wideband MEMS accelerometer and low-noise CMOS interface electronics on a small board, which was then placed on nine conventional lung auscultation sites on the patient's chest walls to capture the pulmonary-induced vibrations (PIVs). A deep learning model was developed and compared with a deterministic time-frequency method to objectively detect wheezing in the PIV signals using data captured from 52 diverse patients with respiratory diseases. The wearable accelerometer patch, paired with the deep learning model, demonstrated high fidelity in capturing and detecting respiratory wheezes and patterns across diverse and pertinent settings. It achieved accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 95%, 96%, and 93%, respectively, with an AUC of 0.99 on the test set-outperforming the deterministic time-frequency approach. Furthermore, the accelerometer patch outperforms the digital stethoscopes in sound analysis while offering immunity to ambient sounds, which not only enhances data quality and performance for computational wheeze detection by a significant margin but also provides a robust sensor solution that can quantify respiration patterns simultaneously."

As there is no effective therapy or vaccine yet, rigorous implementation of traditional public health measures such as isolation and quarantine remains the most effective tool to control the outbreak. When an asymptomatic individual with COVID-19 exposure is being quarantined, it is necessary to perform temperature and symptom surveillance. As such surveillance is intermittent in nature and highly dependent on self-discipline, it has limited effectiveness. Advances in biosensor technologies made it possible to continuously monitor physiological parameters using wearable biosensors with a variety of form factors. OBJECTIVE: To explore the potential of using wearable biosensors to continuously monitor multidimensional physiological parameters for early detection of COVID-19 clinical progression. METHOD: This randomised controlled open-labelled trial will involve 200-1000 asymptomatic subjects with close COVID-19 contact under mandatory quarantine at designated facilities in Hong Kong. Subjects will be randomised to receive a remote monitoring strategy (intervention group) or standard strategy (control group) in a 1:1 ratio during the 14 day-quarantine period. In addition to fever and symptom surveillance in the control group, subjects in the intervention group will wear wearable biosensors on their arms to continuously monitor skin temperature, respiratory rate, blood pressure, pulse rate, blood oxygen saturation and daily activities. These physiological parameters will be transferred in real time to a smartphone application called Biovitals Sentinel. These data will then be processed using a cloud-based multivariate physiology analytics engine called Biovitals to detect subtle physiological changes. The results will be displayed on a web-based dashboard for clinicians' review. The primary outcome is the time to diagnosis of COVID-19. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been obtained from institutional review boards at the study sites. Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals."

Hospital readmissions are common within the first year after transplant and are linked to increased morbidity and mortality. Nearly half of these admissions to the hospital appear to be preventable. Mobile health (mHealth) technologies hold promise to reduce admission to the hospital and improve patient outcomes, as they allow real-time monitoring and timely clinical intervention. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine whether an innovative mHealth intervention can reduce hospital readmission and unscheduled visits to the emergency department or transplant clinic. Our second objective is to assess the use of clinical and continuous ambulatory physiologic data to develop machine learning algorithms to predict the risk of infection, organ rejection, and early mortality in adult heart, kidney, and liver transplant recipients. METHODS: Remote Mobile Outpatient Monitoring in Transplant (Reboot) 2.0 is a two-phased single-center study to be conducted at the University Health Network in Toronto, Canada. Phase one will consist of a 1-year concealed randomized controlled trial of 400 adult heart, kidney, and liver transplant recipients. Participants will be randomized to receive either personalized communication using an mHealth app in addition to standard of care phone communication (intervention group) or standard of care communication only (control group). In phase two, the prior collected data set will be used to develop machine learning algorithms to identify early markers of rejection, infection, and graft dysfunction posttransplantation. The primary outcome will be a composite of any unscheduled hospital admission, visits to the emergency department or transplant clinic, following discharge from the index admission. Secondary outcomes will include patient-reported outcomes using validated self-administered questionnaires, 1-year graft survival rate, 1-year patient survival rate, and the number of standard of care phone voice messages. RESULTS: At the time of this paper's completion, no results are available. CONCLUSIONS: Building from previous work, this project will aim to leverage an innovative mHealth app to improve outcomes and reduce hospital readmission in adult solid organ transplant recipients. Additionally, the development of machine learning algorithms to better predict adverse health outcomes will allow for personalized medicine to tailor clinician-patient interactions and mitigate the health care burden of a growing patient population.

Margin reflex distance 1 (MRD1) and margin reflex distance 2 (MRD2) of 406 eyes from 203 participants were manually evaluated by 3 ophthalmologists and the photographs of 406 eyes were measured automatically for 8 morphologic eyelid features. The Spearman's correlation coefficient, intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland-Altman analyses were used to determine the agreement between manual and automatic MRDs.Results: The dice coefficient was 0.922 and 0.974 for eyelid and cornea segmentation, respectively. A strong correlation was shown between manually and automatically measured MRD1 (r = 0.993, ICC = 0.996) and MRD2 (r = 0.950, ICC = 0.974). Bland-Altman analyses also showed excellent reliability with bias being 0.04 mmbetween automated and manual MRD1 measurements and 0.06 mm for MRD2. Automatically measured 8 features (MRD1, MRD2, palpebral fissure, medial area, lateral area, cornea area, upper and lower eyelid lengths) were found to be increased with age and peaked around the age range of 21 to 30 years.Conclusions: The proposed novel integrative analysis scheme was comparable with human performance. The approach with excellent reliability and reproductivity showed great potential for automated diagnosis and remote monitoring of eyelid-related diseases."

The term ""Digital health"" covers vide range technologies, such as mobile health and applications, electronic records, telehealth and telemedicine, wearable devices, robotics, virtual reality and artificial intelligence. METHODS: Scientometrics is the method that we have done in this study by Cite Space and VOSviewer software, and the result of searching the Web of Science database in plain text format to perform analysis and scientometrics and create outputs in the form of graphs and tables in the field of digital health has been used in stroke rehabilitation. RESULT: A total of 2933 documents related to digital health technologies in stroke rehabilitation were identified by searching for the terms ""stroke rehabilitation"" or ""stroke recovery"" in the title and ""digital health"" across all fields. The strongest citations related to cerebrovascular disease spanned from 1994 to 2007, with randomised clinical trials occurring almost simultaneously and ended by 2012. Consequently, stroke rehabilitation by virtual reality technology has obtained the most citations and clinical trials and as an important part of digital health in the future research process. CONCLUSION: This scientometric study offers insights into how digital health technology can assist stroke patients in self-managing their health and well-being, in addition to supporting integrated stroke rehabilitation. The analysis revealed that three themes were present: author contributors and collaboration networks, temporal evolution, the strongest citation explosions for digital health technologies in stroke rehabilitation research, and semantic analysis."

Moreover, it can also inflate the costs of existing health care systems because of the many metabolic complications that it can cause. The current methods for assessing malnutrition can be cumbersome. A trained practitioner must be present to conduct an assessment, or patients must travel to facilities with specialized equipment to obtain their measurements. Therefore, digital health care is a possible way of closing this gap as it is rapidly gaining traction as a scalable means of improving efficiency in the health care system. It allows for the remote monitoring of nutritional status without requiring the physical presence of practitioners or the use of advanced medical equipment. As such, there is an increasing interest in expanding the range of digital applications to facilitate remote monitoring and management of health issues. In this study, we discuss the feasibility of a novel digital remote method for diagnosing malnutrition using facial morphometrics. Many malnutrition screening assessments include subjective assessments of the head and the face. Facial appearance is often used by clinicians as the first point of qualitative indication of health status. Hence, there may be merit in quantifying these subtle but observable changes using facial morphometrics. Modern advancements in artificial intelligence, data science, sensors, and computing technologies allow facial features to be accurately digitized, which could potentially allow these previously intuitive assessments to be quantified. This study aims to stimulate further discussion and discourse on how this emerging technology can be used to provide real-time access to nutritional status. The use of facial morphometrics extends the use of currently available technology and may provide a scalable, easily deployable solution for nutritional status to be monitored in real time. This will enable clinicians and dietitians to keep track of patients remotely and provide the necessary intervention measures as required, as well as providing health care institutions and policy makers with essential information that can be used to inform and enable targeted public health approaches within affected populations."

This review explores advanced thermal sensing technologies and computer vision-based thermal imaging techniques employed for pig disease and piglet crush symptom monitoring on pig farms. Infrared thermography (IRT) is a non-invasive and efficient technology for measuring pig body temperature, providing advantages such as non-destructive, long-distance, and high-sensitivity measurements. Unlike traditional methods, IRT offers a quick and labor-saving approach to acquiring physiological data impacted by environmental temperature, crucial for understanding pig body physiology and metabolism. IRT aids in early disease detection, respiratory health monitoring, and evaluating vaccination effectiveness. Challenges include body surface emissivity variations affecting measurement accuracy. Thermal imaging and deep learning algorithms are used for pig behavior recognition, with the dorsal plane effective for stress detection. Remote health monitoring through thermal imaging, deep learning, and wearable devices facilitates non-invasive assessment of pig health, minimizing medication use. Integration of advanced sensors, thermal imaging, and deep learning shows potential for disease detection and improvement in pig farming, but challenges and ethical considerations must be addressed for successful implementation. This review summarizes the state-of-the-art technologies used in the pig farming industry, including computer vision algorithms such as object detection, image segmentation, and deep learning techniques. It also discusses the benefits and limitations of IRT technology, providing an overview of the current research field. This study provides valuable insights for researchers and farmers regarding IRT application in pig production, highlighting notable approaches and the latest research findings in this field."

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an intelligent monitoring system for improving CPAP compliance. METHODS: This is a prospective, open label, parallel, randomized controlled trial including 60 newly diagnosed patients with OSA requiring CPAP (Apnea-Hypopnea Index [AHI] >15) from Lleida, Spain. Participants were randomized (1:1) to standard management or the MiSAOS intelligent monitoring system, involving (1) early compliance detection, thus providing measures of patient's CPAP compliance from the very first days of usage; (2) machine learning-based prediction of midterm future CPAP compliance; and (3) rule-based recommendations for the patient (app) and care team. Clinical and anthropometric variables, daytime sleepiness, and quality of life were recorded at baseline and after 6 months, together with patient's compliance, satisfaction, and health care costs. RESULTS: Randomized patients had a mean age of 57 (SD 11) years, mean AHI of 50 (SD 27), and 13% (8/60) were women. Patients in the intervention arm had a mean (95% CI) of 1.14 (0.04-2.23) hours/day higher adjusted CPAP compliance than controls (P=.047). Patients' satisfaction was excellent in both arms, and up to 88% (15/17) of intervention patients reported willingness to keep using the MiSAOS app in the future. No significant differences were found in costs (control: mean €90.2 (SD 53.14) (US $105.76 [SD 62.31]); intervention: mean €96.2 (SD 62.13) (US $112.70 [SD 72.85]); P=.70; €1=US $1.17 was considered throughout). Overall costs combined with results on compliance demonstrated cost-effectiveness in a bootstrap-based simulation analysis. CONCLUSIONS: A machine learning-based intelligent monitoring system increased daily compliance, reported excellent patient satisfaction similar to that reported in usual care, and did not incur in a substantial increase in costs, thus proving cost-effectiveness. This study supports the implementation of intelligent eHealth frameworks for the management of patients with CPAP-treated OSA and confirms the value of patients' empowerment in the management of chronic diseases.

Furthermore, the widespread use of remote monitoring medical devices, under the umbrella of the ""Internet of Medical Things"" (IoMT), has simplified the retrieval of patient information as they allow continuous monitoring and direct access to data by healthcare providers. However, due to possible issues in real-world settings, such as loss of connectivity, irregular use, misuse, or poor adherence to a monitoring program, the data collected might not be sufficient to implement accurate algorithms. For this reason, data augmentation techniques can be used to create synthetic datasets sufficiently large to train machine learning models. In this work, we apply the concept of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to perform a data augmentation from patient data obtained through IoMT sensors for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) monitoring. We also apply an explainable AI algorithm to demonstrate the accuracy of the synthetic data by comparing it to the real data recorded by the sensors. The results obtained demonstrate how synthetic datasets created through a well-structured GAN are comparable with a real dataset, as validated by a novel approach based on machine learning."

While the demand for telemedicine surged worldwide and some countries responded flexibly, in Japan, most telemedicine services were limited to telephone consultations, and full-fledged telemedicine did not become widespread. In addition, the digitalization process in both medicine and wider society lags behind some other nations. It is necessary to accelerate digital transformation in healthcare to build a sustainable society that is resilient to crises, such as new pandemics. In particular, as Japan is facing an issue of super-aged society, a sustainable care model for people with Parkinson's disease, dementia, and intractable neurological diseases should be established. Many neurodegenerative and intractable neurological diseases are progressive; as the disease progresses, patients could become difficult to visit specialists. Although online medical care has many advantages, it does not provide the same quality of information as face-to-face consultations. However, new technology can overcome the limitations of online medical care. As an evolutionary direction for telemedicine, three-dimensional telemedicine technologies are being developed, which enable online medical treatment to be delivered as if the patient was sharing the same space. Telemonitoring can enable the objective and continuous evaluation of patient information at home through the use of motion capture, wearable devices, and other devices. The advancement of digital transformation in medical care should be a game-changer in accumulating big data and analyzing it using artificial intelligence."

However, these measurements are often not as accurate or reliable as clinical evaluations because it is challenging to objectively distinguish the unique gait characteristics of PD. We explore the inference of patients' stage of PD from their gait using machine learning analyses of data gathered from their smartphone sensors. Specifically, we investigate supervised machine learning (ML) models to classify the severity of the motor part of the UPDRS (MDS-UPDRS 2.10-2.13). Our goals are to facilitate remote monitoring of PD patients and to answer the following questions: (1) What is the patient PD stage based on their gait? (2) Which features are best for understanding and classifying PD gait severities? (3) Which ML classifier types best discriminate PD patients from healthy controls (HC)? and (4) Which ML classifier types can discriminate the severity of PD gait anomalies? METHODOLOGY: Our work uses smartphone sensor data gathered from 9520 patients in the mPower study, of whom 3101 participants uploaded gait recordings and 344 subjects and 471 controls uploaded at least 3 walking activities. We selected 152 PD patients who performed at least 3 recordings before and 3 recordings after taking medications and 304 HC who performed at least 3 walking recordings. From the accelerometer and gyroscope sensor data, we extracted statistical, time, wavelet and frequency domain features, and other lifestyle features were derived directly from participants' survey data. We conducted supervised classification experiments using 10-fold cross-validation and measured the model precision, accuracy, and area under the curve (AUC). RESULTS: The best classification model, best feature, highest classification accuracy, and AUC were (1) random forest and entropy rate, 93% and 0.97, respectively, for walking balance (MDS-UPDRS-2.12); (2) bagged trees and MinMaxDiff, 95% and 0.92, respectively, for shaking/tremor (MDS-UPDRS-2.10); (3) bagged trees and entropy rate, 98% and 0.98, respectively, for freeze of gait; and (4) random forest and MinMaxDiff, 95% and 0.99, respectively, for distinguishing PD patients from HC. CONCLUSION: Machine learning classification was challenging due to the use of data that were subjectively labeled based on patients' answers to the MDS-UPDRS survey questions. However, with use of a significantly larger number of subjects than in prior work and clinically validated gait features, we were able to demonstrate that automatic patient classification based on smartphone sensor data can be used to objectively infer the severity of PD and the extent of specific gait anomalies."

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) can be a rapid, real time and non-invasive imaging method for frequent patient surveillance. Here, we report the validation of a portable, robust OCT device in 232 patients (lesions: 347) in different clinical settings. The device deployed with algorithm-based automated diagnosis, showed efficacy in delineation of oral benign and normal (n = 151), OPML (n = 121), and malignant lesions (n = 75) in community and tertiary care settings. This study showed that OCT images analyzed by automated image processing algorithm could distinguish the dysplastic-OPML and malignant lesions with a sensitivity of 95% and 93%, respectively. Furthermore, we explored the ability of multiple (n = 14) artificial neural network (ANN) based feature extraction techniques for delineation high grade-OPML (moderate/severe dysplasia). The support vector machine (SVM) model built over ANN, delineated high-grade dysplasia with sensitivity of 83%, which in turn, can be employed to triage patients for tertiary care. The study provides evidence towards the utility of the robust and low-cost OCT instrument as a point-of-care device in resource-constrained settings and the potential clinical application of device in screening and surveillance of oral cancer."

Due to the miniature size and ability of wireless data transfer, Body Sensor Networks (BSNs) have become the center of attention in current medical media technologies. For a long-term and reliable healthcare system, high energy efficiency, transmission reliability, and longer battery lifetime of wearable sensors devices are required. There is a dire need for empowering sensor-based wearable techniques in BSNs from every aspect i.e., data collection, healthcare monitoring, and diagnosis. The consideration of protocol layers, data routing, and energy optimization strategies improves the efficiency of healthcare delivery. Hence, this work presents some key contributions. Firstly, it proposes a novel avant-garde framework to simultaneously optimize the energy efficiency, battery lifetime, and reliability for smart and connected healthcare. Secondly, in this study, an Adaptive Transmission Data Rate (ATDR) mechanism is proposed, which works on the average constant energy consumption by varying the active time of the sensor node to optimize the energy over the dynamic wireless channel. Moreover, a Self-Adaptive Routing Algorithm (SARA) is developed to adopt a dynamic source routing mechanism with an energy-efficient and shortest possible path, unlike the conventional routing methods. Lastly, real-time datasets are adopted for intensive experimental setup for revealing pervasive and cost-effective healthcare through wearable devices. It is observed and analysed that proposed algorithms outperform in terms of high energy efficiency, better reliability, and longer battery lifetime of portable devices."

However, traditional plastic or elastomer substrates with impermeability, uncomfortableness, mechanical mismatches, and nondegradability greatly restricted their practical applications. Therefore, the fabrication of such pressure sensors with high flexibility, facile degradability, and breathability is still a critical challenge and highly desired. Herein, we present a wearable, breathable, degradable, and highly sensitive MXene/protein nanocomposites-based pressure sensor. The fabricated MXene/protein-based pressure sensor is assembled from a breathable conductive MXene coated silk fibroin nanofiber (MXene-SF) membrane and a silk fibroin nanofiber membrane patterned with a MXene ink-printed (MXene ink-SF) interdigitated electrode, which can serve as the sensing layer and the electrode layer, respectively. The assembled pressure sensor exhibits a wide sensing range (up to 39.3 kPa), high sensitivity (298.4 kPa(-1) for 1.4-15.7 kPa; 171.9 kPa(-1) for 15.7-39.3 kPa), fast response/recovery time (7/16 ms), reliable breathability, excellent cycling stability over 10 000 cycles, good biocompatibility, and robust degradability. Furthermore, it shows great sensing performance in monitoring human psychological signals, acting as an artificial skin for the quantitative illustration of pressure distribution, and wireless biomonitoring in real time. Considering the biodegradable and breathable features, the sensor may become promising to find potential applications in smart electronic skins, human motion detection, disease diagnosis, and human-machine interaction."

This viewpoint offers a perspective on current use of digital health technologies in cardiac rehabilitation, heart failure and secondary prevention. Important barriers which need to be addressed for implementation in medical practice are discussed. To conclude, a future ideal digital tool and integrated healthcare system are envisioned.

The application of artificial intelligence and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in electronic health (E-health) can efficiently promote the development of sustainable and smart cities. The IoT sensors and intelligent algorithms enable the remote monitoring and analyzing of the healthcare data of patients, which reduces the medical and travel expenses in cities. Existing deep learning-based methods for healthcare sensor data classification have made great achievements. However, these methods take much time and storage space for model training and inference. They are difficult to be deployed in small devices to classify the physiological signal of patients in real time. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a micro time series classification model called the micro neural network (MicroNN). The proposed model is micro enough to be deployed on tiny edge devices. MicroNN can be applied to long-term physiological signal monitoring based on edge computing devices. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the classification accuracy and computation complexity of MicroNN. Experiment results show that MicroNN performs better than the state-of-the-art methods. The accuracies on the two datasets (MIT-BIH-AR and INCART) are 98.4% and 98.1%, respectively. Finally, we present an application to show how MicroNN can improve the development of sustainable and smart cities."

The large amount of data collected demands automatic analysis pipelines to extract gait parameters that can be used as clinical endpoints. We introduce a deep learning-based automatic pipeline for wearables that processes tri-axial accelerometry data and extracts gait events-bout segmentation, initial contact (IC), and final contact (FC)-from a single sensor located at either the lower back (near L5), shin or wrist. The gait events detected are posteriorly used for gait parameter estimation, such as step time, length, and symmetry. We report results from a leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) validation on a pilot study dataset of five participants clinically diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (PD) and six healthy controls (HC). Participants wore sensors at three body locations and walked on a pressure-sensing walkway to obtain reference gait data. Mean absolute errors (MAE) for the IC events ranged from 22.82 to 33.09 milliseconds (msecs) for the lower back sensor while for the shin and wrist sensors, MAE ranges were 28.56-64.66 and 40.19-72.50 msecs, respectively. For the FC-event detection, MAE ranges were 29.06-48.42, 40.19-72.70 and 36.06-60.18 msecs for the lumbar, wrist and shin sensors, respectively. Intraclass correlation coefficients, ICC(2,k), between the estimated parameters and the reference data resulted in good-to-excellent agreement (ICC ≥ 0.84) for the lumbar and shin sensors, excluding the double support time (ICC = 0.37 lumbar and 0.38 shin) and swing time (ICC = 0.55 lumbar and 0.59 shin). The wrist sensor also showed good agreements, but the ICCs were lower overall than for the other two sensors. Our proposed analysis pipeline has the potential to extract up to 100 gait-related parameters, and we expect our contribution will further support developments in the fields of wearable sensors, digital health, and remote monitoring in clinical trials."

Sophisticated, remote monitoring technologies now exist that support at-home care. Advances in the research of smart homes for health monitoring have shown these technologies are capable of recognizing and predicting health changes in near-real time. However, few nurses are familiar enough with this technology to use smart homes for optimizing patient care or expanding their reach into the home between healthcare touch points. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this work is to explore a partnership between nurses and smart homes for automated remote monitoring and assessing of patient health. We present a series of health event cases to demonstrate how this partnership may be harnessed to effectively detect and report on clinically relevant health events that can be automatically detected by smart homes. PARTICIPANTS: 25 participants with multiple chronic health conditions. METHODS: Ambient sensors were installed in the homes of 25 participants with multiple chronic health conditions. Motion, light, temperature, and door usage data were continuously collected from participants' homes. Descriptions of health events and participants' associated behaviors were captured via weekly nursing telehealth visits with study participants and used to analyze sensor data representing health events. Two cases of participants with congestive heart failure exacerbations, one case of urinary tract infection, two cases of bowel inflammation flares, and four cases of participants with sleep interruption were explored. RESULTS: For each case, clinically relevant health events aligned with changes from baseline in behavior data patterns derived from sensors installed in the participant's home. In some cases, the detected event was precipitated by additional behavior patterns that could be used to predict the event. CONCLUSIONS: We found evidence in this case series that continuous sensor-based monitoring of patient behavior in home settings may be used to provide automated detection of health events.

In addition, the substrate prevents the evaporation of sweat and is harmful to skin health. In this work, we have enabled the substrate-free laser scribed graphene (SFG) electronic skin (e-skin) with multifunctions. Compared with the e-skin with the substrate, the SFG has good gas permeability, low impedance, and flexibility. Only assisted using water, the SFG can be transferred to almost any objects including silicon and human skin and it can even be suspended. Many through-holes like stomas in leaf can be formed in the SFG, which make it breathable. After designing the pattern, the gauge factor (GF) of graphene electronic skin (GES) can be designed as the strain sensor. Physiological signals such as respiration, human motion, and electrocardiogram (ECG) can be detected. Moreover, the suspended SFG detect vibrations with high sensitivity. Due to the substrate-free structure, the impedance between SFG e-skin and the human body decreases greatly. Finally, an ECG detecting system has been designed based on the GES, which can monitor the body condition in real time. To analyze the ECG signals automatically, a convolutional neural network (CNN) was built and trained successfully. This work has high potential in the field of health telemonitoring."

However, the fabrication of 1D SABs that are compatible with conventional textile techniques for self-powered wearable electronics remains challenging. In this study, a cotton-yarn-based SAB (CYSAB) with a segmental structure is developed, in which carbon-black-modified, pristine yarn and Zn foil-wrapped segments are prepared to serve as the cathode, salt bridge, and anode, respectively. Upon electrolyte absorption, the CYSAB can be rapidly activated. Its performance is closely related to the ion concentration, infiltrated electrolyte volume, and evaporation rate. The CYSAB can tolerate repeated bending and washing without any significant influence on its power output. Moreover, the CYSABs can be woven into fabrics and connected in series and parallel configurations to produce an energy supplying headband, which can be activated by the sweat secreted from a volunteer during a cycling exercise to power light-emitting diode headlights. The developed CYSAB can also be integrated with yarn-based strain sensors to achieve a smart textile for the self-powered sensing of human motion and breathing. This weavable, washable, and scalable CYSAB is expected to contribute to the manufacturing of self-powered smart textiles for future applications in wearable healthcare monitoring."

In this clinical trial, we randomly assigned 500 patients discharged from hospital to home to use either a smartphone or wearable device to collect and transmit remote patient monitoring (RPM) data on activity patterns after hospital discharge. Analyses were conducted at the patient-day level using discrete-time survival analysis. Each arm was split into training and testing folds. The training set used fivefold cross-validation and then final model results are from predictions on the test set. A standard model comprised data collected up to the time of discharge including demographics, comorbidities, hospital length of stay, and vitals prior to discharge. An enhanced model consisted of the standard model plus RPM data. Traditional parametric regression models (logit and lasso) were compared to nonparametric machine learning approaches (random forest, gradient boosting, and ensemble). The main outcome was hospital readmission or death within 30 days of discharge. Prediction of 30-day hospital readmission significantly improved when including remotely-monitored patient data on activity patterns after hospital discharge and using nonparametric machine learning approaches. Wearables slightly outperformed smartphones but both had good prediction of 30-day hospital-readmission."

The advancements in AI have also improved virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality (MR) experience allowing a greater opportunity for use in the field of medicine. Objective To evaluate the knowledge, attitude and practice of AI and types of realities among Pakistani healthcare professionals (HCPs). Materials and methods This was a prospective, nationwide study designed at the Department of Neurosurgery at Punjab Institute of Neurosciences (PINS), Lahore, was conducted between January 2024 to February 2024. More than 500 HCPs were approached, out of which 176 participated in this survey consensually. A pre-formed general questionnaire based on knowledge, attitude and practices of AI and types of realities was modified according to local conditions. Google Forms (Google Inc., USA) was used to conduct the one-time sign up response. Statistical Package for Social Sciences (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 24, USA) was used to analyze submitted responses. Results About 69.9% respondents were male HCPs. Most of the respondents were from the fields of neurosurgery, medicine and general surgery, i.e., 10.80%, 10.20% and 4%, respectively. More than 90% HCPs used Internet and electronic devices daily. A majority of 62.50% respondents agreed that AI brings benefits for the patients, while at the same time, 45.50% agreed that they would not trust the assessment of AI more than that of HCPs. 61% HCPs feared that AI-based systems could be manipulated from the outside sources, like terrorists and hackers. Although 90% respondents knew the definition of AR and VR, a strikingly low 40% respondents could only identify the practical applications of these realities when asked in a mini-quiz. About 61.40% HCPs never used any AI-based application throughout their clinical practice, but Google Health was used by 29.50% respondents, followed by Remote Patient Monitoring AI application used by 3.4% individuals. Conclusion There is an evident under-utilization of AI and types of realities in clinical practice in Pakistan. Lack of awareness, paucity of resources and conventional clinical practices are the key reasons identified. Pakistan is on the path towards the point where the developed world is currently. There is a potential to move past the initial stages of AI implementation and into more advanced modes of adopting AI and types of realities."

Continuous monitoring of multiple advanced physiological parameters during diuresis may allow better differentiation of patients into subgroups according to their responses. In this study, 29 HF patients were monitored during outpatient intravenous diuresis, using a noninvasive wearable multi-parameter monitor. Analysis of changes in these parameters during the course of diuresis aimed to recognize subgroups with different response patterns. Parameters did not change significantly, however, subgroup analysis of the last quartile of treatment showed significant differences in cardiac output, cardiac index, stroke volume, pulse rate, and systemic vascular resistance according to gender, and in systolic blood pressure according to habitus. Changes in the last quartile could be differentiated using k-means, a technique of unsupervised machine learning. Moreover, patients' responses could be best clustered into four groups. Analysis of baseline parameters showed that two of the clusters differed by baseline parameters, body mass index, and diabetes status. To conclude, we show that physiological changes during diuresis in HF patients can be categorized into subgroups sharing similar response trends, making noninvasive monitoring a potential key to personalized treatment in HF."

Artificial intelligence (AI) emerges as a promising tool to identify definitive predictors for ankle sprains. This paper aims to summarize the use of AI in investigating the ankle biomechanics of healthy and subjects with ankle sprains. METHODS: Articles published between 2010 and 2023 were searched from five electronic databases. 59 papers were included for analysis with regards to: i). types of motion tested (functional vs. purposeful ankle movement); ii) types of biomechanical parameters measured (kinetic vs kinematic); iii) types of sensor systems used (lab-based vs field-based); and, iv) AI techniques used. FINDINGS: Most studies (83.1%) examined biomechanics during functional motion. Single kinematic parameter, specifically ankle range of motion, could obtain accuracy up to 100% in identifying injury status. Wearable sensor exhibited high reliability for use in both laboratory and on-field/clinical settings. AI algorithms primarily utilized electromyography and joint angle information as input data. Support vector machine was the most used supervised learning algorithm (18.64%), while artificial neural network demonstrated the highest accuracy in eight studies. INTERPRETATIONS: The potential for remote patient monitoring is evident with the adoption of field-based devices. Nevertheless, AI-based sensors are underutilized in detecting ankle motions at risk of sprain. We identify three key challenges: sensor designs, the controllability of AI models, and the integration of AI-sensor models, providing valuable insights for future research."

Several vital signals, such as voice signals, can be acquired anytime and anywhere, achieved with the least possible discomfort to the patient thanks to the development of increasingly advanced devices. The integration of sensors with artificial intelligence techniques contributes to the realization of faster and easier solutions aimed at improving early diagnosis, personalized treatment, remote patient monitoring and better decision making, all tasks vital in a critical situation such as that of the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper presents a study about the possibility to support the early and non-invasive detection of COVID-19 through the analysis of voice signals by means of the main machine learning algorithms. If demonstrated, this detection capacity could be embedded in a powerful mobile screening application. To perform this important study, the Coswara dataset is considered. The aim of this investigation is not only to evaluate which machine learning technique best distinguishes a healthy voice from a pathological one, but also to identify which vowel sound is most seriously affected by COVID-19 and is, therefore, most reliable in detecting the pathology. The results show that Random Forest is the technique that classifies most accurately healthy and pathological voices. Moreover, the evaluation of the vowel /e/ allows the detection of the effects of COVID-19 on voice quality with a better accuracy than the other vowels."

The work tackles important RPM concerns such early health issue diagnosis and accurate real-time physiological data collection and analysis using wearable IoT devices. By assessing important health factors like heart rate, blood pressure, pulse, temperature, activity level, weight management, respiration rate, medication adherence, sleep patterns, and oxygen levels, the suggested Remote Patient Monitor Model (RPMM) attains a noteworthy accuracy of 97.23%. The model's capacity to identify spatial and temporal relationships in health data is improved by novel techniques such as the use of CNN for spatial analysis and feature extraction and LSTM for temporal sequence modeling. Early intervention is made easier by this synergistic approach, which enhances trend identification and anomaly detection in vital signs. A variety of datasets are used to validate the model's robustness, highlighting its efficacy in remote patient care.

The SF algorithm avoids incorrect predictions of the suspect. Health data are continuously monitored and recorded on the ThingSpeak cloud server. When a COVID-19 suspect is detected, an emergency email is sent to healthcare personnel with the GPS position of the suspect. A lightweight and fast deep learning model is used to recognize appropriate mask positioning; this restricts virus transmission. When tested with the real-world masked face dataset (RMFD) dataset, the enhanced MobileNetV2 neural network is optimal for Raspberry Pi. Our IoT device and deep learning model are 98.50% (compared to commercial devices) and 99.26% accurate, respectively, and the time required for face mask evaluation is 31.1 milliseconds. The proposed device is useful for remote monitoring of covid patients. Thus, the method will find medical application in the detection of COVID-19-positive patients. The device is also wearable."

Unattended stress is a silent killer and may lead to fatal physical and mental disorders if left unidentified. Stress identification based on individual judgement often leads to under-diagnosis and delayed treatment possibilities. EEG-based stress monitoring is quite popular in this context, but impractical to use for continuous remote monitoring.Continuous remote monitoring of stress using signals acquired from everyday wearables like smart watches is the best alternative here. Non-EEG data such as heart rate and ectodermal activity can also act as indicators of physiological stress. In this work, we have explored the possibility of using nonlinear features from non-EEG data such as (a) heart rate, (b) ectodermal activity, (c) body temperature (d) SpO2 and (e) acceleration in detecting four different types of neurological states; namely (1) Relaxed state, (2) State of Physical stress, (3) State of Cognitive stress and (4) State of Emotional stress. Physiological data of 20 healthy adults have been used from the noneeg database of PhysioNet.Results: We used two machine learning models; a linear logistic regression and a nonlinear random forest to detect (a) stress from relaxed state and (4) the four different neurological states. We trained the models using linear and nonlinear features separately. For the 2-class and 4-class problems, using nonlinear features increased the accuracy of the models. Moreover, it is also proved in this study that by using nonlinear features, we can avoid the use of complex machine learning models."

While the current standards include questionnaire-based assessments for monitoring activities of daily living (ADLs), there is an urgent need for advanced indoor localization technologies that ensure privacy. This study explores the use of Ultra-Wideband (UWB) technology for activity recognition in a mock condo in the Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital. UWB systems with built-in Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors were tested, using anchors set up across the condo and a tag worn by patients. We tested various UWB setups, changed the number of anchors, and varied the tag placement (on the wrist or chest). Wrist-worn tags consistently outperformed chest-worn tags, and the nine-anchor configuration yielded the highest accuracy. Machine learning models were developed to classify activities based on UWB and IMU data. Models that included positional data significantly outperformed those that did not. The Random Forest model with a 4 s data window achieved an accuracy of 94%, compared to 79.2% when positional data were excluded. These findings demonstrate that incorporating positional data with IMU sensors is a promising method for effective remote patient monitoring."

Sweat, one of the most suitable biological fluids for non-invasive monitoring, contains various chemical elements relating abundant information about human health conditions. In this work, a new type of non-invasive and highly stretchable potentiometric sweat sensor was developed based on all-solid-state ion-selective electrode (ISE) coupled with poly(dimethylsiloxane; PDMS) and polyurethane (PU). This highly stretchable composite of PDMS-PU allows the sensor to be robust, with the PDMS providing a flexible backbone and the PU enhancing the adhesion between the electrodes and the substrate. In addition, graphene-carbon nanotube (CNT) network 3D nanomaterials were introduced to modify the ion selective membrane (ISM) in order to increase the charge transfer activity of the ISEs, which also could minimize the formation of water layers on the electrode surface, as such nanomaterials are highly hydrophobic. As a result, the sensor demonstrated a wide detection range of NH(4)(+) from 10(-6) M to 10(-1) M with high stability and sensitivity-showing a high sensitivity of 59.6 ± 1.5 mV/log [NH(4)(+)] and an LOD lower than 10(-6) M. Under a strain of 40%, the sensor still showed a sensitivity of 42.7 ± 3.1 mV/log [NH(4)(+)]. The proposed highly stretchable and robust electrochemical sweat sensor provides a new choice for wearable-device-based personal daily healthcare management beyond hospital-centric healthcare monitoring."

Although neurological deficits require fast initiation of treatment in a restricted time, it is difficult for nonspecialists to detect and objectively assess the symptoms. In the clinical environment, diagnoses and decisions are based on clinical grading methods, including the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score or the Medical Research Council (MRC) score, which have been used to measure motor weakness. Objective grading in various environments is necessitated for consistent agreement among patients, caregivers, paramedics, and medical staff to facilitate rapid diagnoses and dispatches to appropriate medical centers. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to develop an autonomous grading system for stroke patients. We investigated the feasibility of our new system to assess motor weakness and grade NIHSS and MRC scores of 4 limbs, similar to the clinical examinations performed by medical staff. METHODS: We implemented an automatic grading system composed of a measuring unit with wearable sensors and a grading unit with optimized machine learning. Inertial sensors were attached to measure subtle weaknesses caused by paralysis of upper and lower limbs. We collected 60 instances of data with kinematic features of motor disorders from neurological examination and demographic information of stroke patients with NIHSS 0 or 1 and MRC 7, 8, or 9 grades in a stroke unit. Training data with 240 instances were generated using a synthetic minority oversampling technique to complement the imbalanced number of data between classes and low number of training data. We trained 2 representative machine learning algorithms, an ensemble and a support vector machine (SVM), to implement auto-NIHSS and auto-MRC grading. The optimized algorithms performed a 5-fold cross-validation and were searched by Bayes optimization in 30 trials. The trained model was tested with the 60 original hold-out instances for performance evaluation in accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC). RESULTS: The proposed system can grade NIHSS scores with an accuracy of 83.3% and an AUC of 0.912 using an optimized ensemble algorithm, and it can grade with an accuracy of 80.0% and an AUC of 0.860 using an optimized SVM algorithm. The auto-MRC grading achieved an accuracy of 76.7% and a mean AUC of 0.870 in SVM classification and an accuracy of 78.3% and a mean AUC of 0.877 in ensemble classification. CONCLUSIONS: The automatic grading system quantifies proximal weakness in real time and assesses symptoms through automatic grading. The pilot outcomes demonstrated the feasibility of remote monitoring of motor weakness caused by stroke. The system can facilitate consistent grading with instant assessment and expedite dispatches to appropriate hospitals and treatment initiation by sharing auto-MRC and auto-NIHSS scores between prehospital and hospital responses as an objective observation."

In this paper, we introduce a transfer-learning based Long-term Recurrent Convolution Network (LRCN) named as 'MyoNet' for the classification of lower limb movements, along with the prediction of the corresponding knee joint angle. The model consists of three blocks- (i) feature extractor block, (ii) joint angle prediction block, and (iii) movement classification block. Initially, the model is end-to-end trained for knee joint angle prediction followed by transferring the knowledge of a trained model to the movement classification through transfer-learning approach making a memory and computationally efficient design. The proposed MyoNet was evaluated on publicly available University of California (UC) Irvine machine learning repository dataset of the lower limb for 11 healthy subjects and 11 subjects with knee pathology for three movements type-walking, standing with knee flexion movements and sitting with knee extension movements. The average mean absolute error (MAE) resulted in the prediction of joint angle for healthy subjects and subjects with knee pathology are 8.1 % and 9.2 % respectively. Subsequently, an average classification accuracy of 98.1 % and 92.4 % were achieved for healthy subjects and subjects with knee pathology, respectively. Interestingly, the significance of this study in itself is promising with substantial improvement in the performance compared to state-of-the-art methodologies. The clinical significance of such surface electromyography signals (sEMG) based movement recognition and prediction of corresponding joint angle system could be beneficial for remote monitoring of rehabilitation progress by the physiotherapist using wearables."

AD is caused by triggers which can lead to rapid escalation of pathophysiological responses and if the trigger is not removed, AD can be fatal. There is currently no objective, non-invasive and accurate monitoring system available to automatically detect the onset of AD symptoms in real time in a non-clinical setting. Technology or Method: We developed a user-independent method of symptomatic AD detection in real time with a wearable physiological telemetry system (PTS) and a machine learning model using data from eleven participants with SCI. RESULTS: The PTS could detect onset of AD symptoms with an average accuracy of 94.10% and a false negative rate of 4.89%. CONCLUSIONS: The PTS can detect the onset of the symptoms AD with high sensitivity and specificity to assist people with SCIs in preventing the occurrence of AD. It would enable persons with high level SCIs to be more independent and pursue vocational activities while granting continuous medical oversight. Clinical Impact: The PTS could serve as a supplementary tool to current solutions to detect the onset of AD and prepare individuals who are newly injured to be better prepared for AD episodes. Moreover, it could be translated into a system to encourage individuals to practice better healthcare management to prevent future occurrences."

In parallel, ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) were collected each minute from the study participants. A 2-minute moving window, with one minute shift, was applied to each 16-minute exercise session to divide it into a total of fifteen 2-minute windows. Based on the self-reported RPE, each exercise window was labeled as ""high exertion"" or ""low exertion"" classes. The heart rate variability (HRV) characteristics in time and frequency domains were extracted from the collected ECG signals for each window. In addition, collected oxygen saturation levels, pulse rate, and RPMs were averaged for each window. The best predictive features were then selected using the minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) algorithm. Top selected features were then used to assess the accuracy of five ML classifiers to predict the level of exertion. The Naïve Bayes model demonstrated the best performance with an accuracy of 80% and an F1 score of 79%."

In this paper, we present a novel methodology for categorizing AIoMT devices through the application of decentralized processing, referred to as ""Federated Learning"" (FL). Our approach involves deploying a system on standard IoT devices and labeled IoMT devices for training purposes and attribute extraction. Through this process, we extract and map the interconnected attributes from a global federated cum aggression server. The aim of this terminology is to extract interdependent devices via federated learning, ensuring data privacy and adherence to operational policies. Consequently, a global training dataset repository is coordinated to establish a centralized indexing and synchronization knowledge repository. The categorization process employs generic labels for devices transmitting medical data through regular communication channels. We evaluate our proposed methodology across a variety of IoT, IoMT, and AIoMT devices, demonstrating effective classification and labeling. Our technique yields a reliable categorization index for facilitating efficient access and optimization of medical devices within global servers."

Data-driven models of human metabolism would constitute a reliable, fast, and continuously updating model for predictive analytics. Wearable devices, such as smart bands and impedance balances, allow the real time and remote monitoring of physiological parameters, providing for a flux of data carrying information on user metabolism. Here, we developed a data-driven model of end-user metabolism, the Personalized Metabolic Avatar (PMA), to estimate its personalized reactions to diets. PMA consists of a gated recurrent unit (GRU) deep learning model trained to forecast personalized weight variations according to macronutrient composition and daily energy balance. The model can perform simulations and evaluation of diet plans, allowing the definition of tailored goals for achieving ideal weight.

However, assessments of postural instability, known as postural sway, leverage force platforms or wearable accelerometers, and are most often conducted in laboratory environments and are thus not broadly accessible. Remote measures of postural sway captured during daily life may provide a more accessible alterative, but their ability to capture disease status and fall risk has not yet been established. We explored the utility of remote measures of postural sway in a sample of 33 PwMS. Remote measures of sway differed significantly from lab-based measures, but still demonstrated moderately strong associations with patient-reported measures of balance and mobility impairment. Machine learning models for predicting fall risk trained on lab data provided an Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.79, while remote data only achieved an AUC of 0.51. Remote model performance improved to an AUC of 0.74 after a new, subject-specific k-means clustering approach was applied for identifying the remote data most appropriate for modelling. This cluster-based approach for analyzing remote data also strengthened associations with patient-reported measures, increasing their strength above those observed in the lab. This work introduces a new framework for analyzing data from remote patient monitoring technologies and demonstrates the promise of remote postural sway assessment for assessing fall risk and characterizing balance impairment in PwMS."

For the analysis of medical scans, various studies integrate sophisticated deep learning strategies. A smart monitoring system is needed as a proactive diagnostic solution that may be employed in an epidemiological scenario such as COVID-19. Consequently, this work offers an intelligent medicare system that is an IoT-empowered, deep learning-based decision support system (DSS) for the automated detection and categorization of infectious diseases (COVID-19 and pneumothorax). The proposed DSS system was evaluated using three independent standard-based chest X-ray scans. The suggested DSS predictor has been used to identify and classify areas on whole X-ray scans with abnormalities thought to be attributable to COVID-19, reaching an identification and classification accuracy rate of 89.58% for normal images and 89.13% for COVID-19 and pneumothorax. With the suggested DSS system, a judgment depending on individual chest X-ray scans may be made in approximately 0.01 s. As a result, the DSS system described in this study can forecast at a pace of 95 frames per second (FPS) for both models, which is near to real-time."

Nevertheless, the process of regeneration presents the difficulty of effectively prioritizing the information of emergency patients in light of the extensive amount of data generated by several integrated health care devices. The main goal of this study is to be improving the procedure of prioritizing emergency patients by implementing the Real-time Triage Optimization Framework (RTOF), an innovative method that utilizes diverse data from the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). METHODS: The study's methodology utilized a variety of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) data, such as sensor data and texts derived from electronic medical records.

Photoplethysmography (PPG), a technology commonly used in wearable devices such as smartwatches, has shown promise for constructing ECGs. Several methods have been proposed for ECG reconstruction using PPG signals, but some require signal alignment during the training phase, which is not feasible in real-life settings where ECG signals are not collected at the same time as PPG signals. To address this challenge, we introduce PPG2ECGps, an end-to-end, patient-specific deep-learning neural network utilizing the W-Net architecture. This novel approach enables direct ECG signal reconstruction from PPG signals, eliminating the need for signal alignment. Our experiments show that the proposed model achieves mean values of 0.977 mV for Pearson's correlation coefficient, 0.037 mV for the root mean square error, and 0.010 mV for the normalized dynamic time-warped distance when comparing reconstructed ECGs to reference ECGs from a dataset of 500 records. As PPG signals are more accessible than ECG signals, our proposed model has significant potential to improve patient monitoring and diagnosis in healthcare settings via wearable devices."

The aims of this study were firstly to employ deep neural networks to convert IMU data to ankle joint angles that are indistinguishable from those derived from motion capture-based inverse kinematics (IK) - the reference standard; and secondly, to validate the robustness of this approach across contrasting walking speeds in healthy individuals. Kinematics data were simultaneously calculated using IMUs and IK from 9 subjects during walking on a treadmill at 0.5 m/s, 1.0 m/s and 1.5 m/s. A generative adversarial network was trained using gait data at two of the walking speeds to predict ankle kinematics from IMU data alone for the third walking speed. There were significant differences between IK and IMU joint angle predictions for ankle eversion and internal rotation during walking at 0.5 m/s and 1.0 m/s (p < 0.001); however, no significant differences in joint angles were observed between the generative adversarial network prediction and IK at any speed or plane of joint motion (p < 0.05). The RMS difference in ankle joint kinematics between the generative adversarial network and IK for walking at 1.0 m/s was 3.8°, 2.1° and 3.5° for dorsiflexion, inversion and axial rotation, respectively. The modeling approach presented for real-time IMU to ankle joint angle conversion, which can be readily expanded to other joints, may provide enhanced IMU capability in applications such as telemedicine, remote monitoring and rehabilitation."

However, current wearable electronics made from materials like conductive elastomers, hydrogels, and liquid metals face limitations, including low permeability, poor adhesion, inadequate conductivity, and limited stretchability. These issues hinder their effectiveness in long-term healthcare monitoring and exercise monitoring. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel design of web-droplet-like electronics featuring a semi-liquid metal coating for wearable applications. This innovative design offers high permeability, excellent stretchability, strong adhesion, and good conductivity for the electronic skin. The unique structure, inspired by the architecture of a spider web, significantly enhances air permeability compared to commercial breathable patches. Furthermore, the distribution of polyborosiloxane mimics the adhesive properties of spider web mucus, while the use of semi-liquid metals in this design results in remarkable conductivity (9 × 10(6) S/m) and tensile performance (up to 850% strain). This advanced electronic skin technology enables long-term monitoring of various physiological parameters and supports machine learning recognition functions with unparalleled advantages. This web-droplet structure design strategy holds great promise for commercial applications in medical health monitoring and disease diagnosis."

Coronary angiography, the principal diagnostic tool for CAD, is invasive, expensive, and requires a lot of skilled effort. The current study aims to develop an automated and non-invasive CAD detection model and improve its performance as closely as possible to clinically acceptable diagnostic sensitivity. Electrocardiogram (ECG) characteristics are observed to be altered due to CAD and can be studied to develop a screening tool for its detection. The subject's clinical information can help broadly identify the high-cardiac-risk population and serve as a primary step in diagnosing CAD. This paper presents an approach to automatically detect CAD based on clinical data, morphological ECG features, and heart rate variability (HRV) features extracted from short-duration Lead-II ECG recordings. A few popular machine-learning classifiers, including support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), K-nearest neighbours (KNN), Gaussian Naïve Bayes (GNB), and multi-layer perceptron (MLP), are trained on the extracted feature space, and their performance is evaluated. Classifiers built by integrating clinical data and features extracted from ECG recordings demonstrated better performance than those built on each feature set separately, and the RF classifier outperforms other considered machine learners and reports an average testing accuracy of 94% and a G-mean score of 92% with a 5-fold cross-validation training accuracy of 95(± 0.04)%.Clinical relevance- The proposed method uses a brief, single-lead ECG recording and performs similarly to current clinical practices in an explainable manner. This makes it suitable for deployment via wearable technology (like smart watch gadgets) and telemonitoring, which may facilitate an earlier and more widespread CAD diagnosis."

Prescribed small-ruminant foraging is considered a sustainable, cost-effective strategy, but demonstrating a link between animal presence and vegetation change is challenging. This study tested whether the effect of small-ruminant herd presence in Mediterranean woodlands can be detected by integrating remote sensing and herd tracking at the landscape scale. The daily foraging routes of seven shepherded goat herds that exploited a 100-km(2) forested area of the Judean Hills, Israel, were tracked over six years using GPS (Global Positioning System) collars. Herd locations were converted to stocking rates, with units of animal-presence-days per unit area per defined time period, and mapped at a spatial resolution of 10 m. We estimated pixel-level vegetation cover change based on a time series of 63 monthly Landsat-8 images expressed as the normalized soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI). Spatiotemporal trend analysis assessed the magnitude and direction of change, and a random forest machine-learning algorithm estimated the relative impact on vegetation cover change of environmental factors as well as the herd-related factors of stocking rate that accrued over six years and distance to the closest corral. The last two factors were among the most influential factors determining vegetation cover change in the regional and individual-herd analyses. In some respects, the permanent herds differed in their spatial pattern of stocking rate from the mobile herds that periodically relocated their night corral throughout the year, but stocking rate scaled logarithmically for all herds individually and combined. The combination of multi-season GPS tracking, remote sensing, and machine-learning techniques, applied at a regional scale, detected herd impacts on vegetation cover trends, consistent with livestock foraging being an effective tool for fuel reduction in Mediterranean woodlands."

However, the parameters used to interpret mNGS data, such as read count, genus rank, and coverage, lack explicit performance evaluation. In this study, the developed indicators as well as novel parameters were assessed for their performance in bacterium detection. Methods: We developed several relevant parameters, including 10M normalized reads, double-discard reads, Genus Rank Ratio, King Genus Rank Ratio, Genus Rank Ratio*Genus Rank, and King Genus Rank Ratio*Genus Rank. These parameters, together with frequently used read indicators including raw reads, reads per million mapped reads (RPM), transcript per kilobase per million mapped reads (TPM), Genus Rank, and coverage were analyzed for their diagnostic efficiency in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), a common source for detecting eight bacterium pathogens: Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Hemophilus influenzae, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Aspergillus fumigatus. Results: The results demonstrated that these indicators exhibited good diagnostic efficacy for the eight pathogens. The AUC values of all indicators were almost greater than 0.9, and the corresponding sensitivity and specificity values were almost greater than 0.8, excepted coverage. The negative predictive value of all indicators was greater than 0.9. The results showed that the use of double-discarded reads, Genus Rank Ratio*Genus Rank, and King Genus Rank Ratio*Genus Rank exhibited better diagnostic efficiency than that of raw reads, RPM, TPM, and in Genus Rank. These parameters can serve as a reference for interpreting mNGS data of BALF. Moreover, precision filters integrating our novel parameters were built to detect the eight bacterium pathogens in BALF samples through machine learning. Summary: In this study, we developed a set of novel parameters for pathogen identification in clinical mNGS based on reads and ranking. These parameters were found to be more effective in diagnosing pathogens than traditional approaches. The findings provide valuable insights for improving the interpretation of mNGS reports in clinical settings, specifically in BALF analysis."

OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a machine learning-based algorithm that can provide survival risk stratification for patients with advanced oral cancer who have comprehensive clinicopathologic and genetic data. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this prognostic cohort study, the elastic net penalized Cox proportional hazards regression-based risk stratification model was developed and validated using single-center data collected between January 1, 1996, and December 31, 2011. In total, comprehensive clinicopathologic and genetic data (including clinical, pathologic, and 44 cancer-related gene variant profiles) of 334 patients with stage III or IV oral squamous cell carcinoma were used to develop and validate the algorithm in this 15-year cohort study. Data analysis was conducted between February 1, 2018, and May 6, 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcomes were cancer-specific survival, distant metastasis-free survival, and locoregional recurrence-free survival. Model performance was compared in terms of the Akaike information criterion and the Harrell concordance index (C index). RESULTS: Complete data were available for 334 patients (315 men; median age at onset, 48 years [interquartile range, 42-56 years]). The predictive models using comprehensive clinicopathologic and genetic data outperformed those using clinicopathologic data alone. In the groups of postoperative patients receiving adjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy, the models demonstrated higher classification performance than those using clinicopathologic data alone in cancer-specific survival (mean [SD] C index, 0.689 [0.050] vs 0.673 [0.051]; P = .02) and locoregional recurrence-free survival (mean [SD] C index, 0.693 [0.039] vs 0.678 [0.035]; P = .004). The classification performance in distant metastasis-free survival was not different (mean [SD] C index, 0.702 [0.056] vs 0.688 [0.048]; P = .09). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A risk stratification model using comprehensive clinicopathologic and genetic data accurately differentiated the high-risk group from the low-risk group in cancer-specific survival and locoregional recurrence-free survival for postoperative patients with advanced oral cancer. This algorithm could be used through an online calculator to provide additional personalized information for postoperative management of patients with advanced oral squamous cell carcinoma."

Symptoms of MS fluctuate, and standard biannual clinical visits cannot capture these fluctuations. Remote monitoring techniques that leverage wearable sensors have recently emerged as an approach sensitive to disease variability. Previous research has shown that fall risk can be identified from walking data collected by wearable sensors in controlled laboratory conditions however this data may not be generalizable to variable home environments. To investigate fall risk and daily activity performance from remote data, we introduce a new open-source dataset featuring data collected from 38 PwMS, 21 of whom are identified as fallers and 17 as non-fallers based on their six-month fall history. This dataset contains inertial-measurement-unit data from eleven body locations collected in the laboratory, patient-reported surveys and neurological assessments, and two days of free-living sensor data from the chest and right thigh. Six-month (n = 28) and one-year repeat assessment (n = 15) data are also available for some patients. To demonstrate the utility of these data, we explore the use of free-living walking bouts for characterizing fall risk in PwMS, compare these data to those collected in controlled environments, and examine the impact of bout duration on gait parameters and fall risk estimates. Both gait parameters and fall risk classification performance were found to change with bout duration. Deep learning models outperformed feature-based models using home data; the best performance was observed with all bouts for deep-learning and short bouts for feature-based models when evaluating performance on individual bouts. Overall, short duration free-living walking bouts were found to be the least similar to laboratory walking, longer duration free-living walking bouts provided more significant differences between fallers and non-fallers, and an aggregation of all free-living walking bouts yields the best performance in fall risk classification."

Electrocardiogram (ECG), a fast, easy, and non-invasive method, is generally employed in the evaluation of heart conditions that lead to heart ailments and the identification of heart diseases. The deployment of IoT devices for arrhythmia classification offers many benefits such as remote patient care, continuous monitoring, and early recognition of abnormal heart rhythms. However, it is challenging to diagnose and manually classify arrhythmia as the manual diagnosis of ECG signals is a time-consuming process. Therefore, the current article presents the automated arrhythmia classification using the Farmland Fertility Algorithm with Hybrid Deep Learning (AAC-FFAHDL) approach in the IoT platform. The proposed AAC-FFAHDL system exploits the hyperparameter-tuned DL model for ECG signal analysis, thereby diagnosing arrhythmia. In order to accomplish this, the AAC-FFAHDL technique initially performs data pre-processing to scale the input signals into a uniform format. Further, the AAC-FFAHDL technique uses the HDL approach for detection and classification of arrhythmia. In order to improve the classification and detection performance of the HDL approach, the AAC-FFAHDL technique involves an FFA-based hyperparameter tuning process. The proposed AAC-FFAHDL approach was validated through simulation using the benchmark ECG database. The comparative experimental analysis outcomes confirmed that the AAC-FFAHDL system achieves promising performance compared with other models under different evaluation measures."

Recent advances in technology allow for remote monitoring of physiological measures such as heart rate, oxygen saturation, blood glucose, and blood pressure. However, the ability to accurately detect falls and monitor physical activity remotely without invading privacy or remembering to wear a costly device remains an ongoing concern. Our proposed system utilizes a millimeter-wave (mmwave) radar sensor (IWR6843ISK-ODS) connected to an NVIDIA Jetson Nano board for continuous monitoring of human activity. We developed a PointNet neural network for real-time human activity monitoring that can provide activity data reports, tracking maps, and fall alerts. Using radar helps to safeguard patients' privacy by abstaining from recording camera images. We evaluated our system for real-time operation and achieved an inference accuracy of 99.5% when recognizing five types of activities: standing, walking, sitting, lying, and falling. Our system would facilitate the ability to detect falls and monitor physical activity in home and institutional settings to improve telemedicine by providing objective data for more timely and targeted interventions.

Electrocardiographic artificial intelligence (ECG-AI) models for FCHD risk prediction using ECG data from wearable devices could enable wider screening/monitoring efforts. OBJECTIVES: To develop a single-lead ECG-based deep learning model for FCHD risk prediction and assess concordance between clinical and Apple Watch ECGs. METHODS: An FCHD single-lead (""lead I"" from 12-lead ECGs) ECG-AI model was developed using 167,662 ECGs (50,132 patients) from the University of Tennessee Health Sciences Center. Eighty percent of the data (5-fold cross-validation) was used for training and 20% as a holdout. Cox proportional hazards (CPH) models incorporating ECG-AI predictions with age, sex, and race were also developed. The models were tested on paired clinical single-lead and Apple Watch ECGs from 243 St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study participants. The correlation and concordance of the predictions were assessed using Pearson correlation (R), Spearman correlation (ρ), and Cohen's kappa. RESULTS: The ECG-AI and CPH models resulted in AUC = 0.76 and 0.79, respectively, on the 20% holdout and AUC = 0.85 and 0.87 on the Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist external validation data. There was moderate-strong positive correlation between predictions (R = 0.74, ρ = 0.67, and κ = 0.58) when tested on the 243 paired ECGs. The clinical (lead I) and Apple Watch predictions led to the same low/high-risk FCHD classification for 99% of the participants. CPH prediction correlation resulted in an R = 0.81, ρ = 0.76, and κ = 0.78. CONCLUSION: Risk of FCHD can be predicted from single-lead ECGs obtained from wearable devices and are statistically concordant with lead I of a 12-lead ECG."

Disease prediction is one of the emerging applications in current practices. In the method described in this paper, lung cancer prediction is implemented using deep learning and IoT, which is a challenging task in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). Because lung cancer is a dangerous medical disease that must be identified at a higher detection rate, disease-related information is obtained from IoT medical devices and transmitted to the server. The medical data are then processed and classified into two categories, benign and malignant, using a multi-layer CNN (ML-CNN) model. In addition, a particle swarm optimization method is used to improve the learning ability (loss and accuracy). This step uses medical data (CT scan and sensor information) based on the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). For this purpose, sensor information and image information from IoMT devices and sensors are gathered, and then classification actions are taken. The performance of the proposed technique is compared with well-known existing methods, such as the Support Vector Machine (SVM), probabilistic neural network (PNN), and conventional CNN, in terms of accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, F-score, and computation time. For this purpose, two lung datasets were tested to evaluate the performance: Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC) and Linear Imaging and Self-Scanning Sensor (LISS) datasets. Compared to alternative methods, the trial outcomes showed that the suggested technique has the potential to help the radiologist make an accurate and efficient early lung cancer diagnosis. The performance of the proposed ML-CNN was analyzed using Python, where the accuracy (2.5-10.5%) was high when compared to the number of instances, precision (2.3-9.5%) was high when compared to the number of instances, sensitivity (2.4-12.5%) was high when compared to several instances, the F-score (2-30%) was high when compared to the number of cases, the error rate (0.7-11.5%) was low compared to the number of cases, and the computation time (170 ms to 400 ms) was low compared to how many cases were computed for the proposed work, including previous known methods. The proposed ML-CNN architecture shows that this technique outperforms previous works."

When these people live alone, it is convenient that a caregiver or family member visits them periodically. However, these visits do not prevent falls when the elderly person is alone. Furthermore, in exceptional circumstances, such as a pandemic, we must avoid unnecessary mobility. This is why remote monitoring systems are currently on the rise, and several commercial solutions can be found. However, current solutions use devices attached to the waist or wrist, causing discomfort in the people who wear them. The users also tend to forget to wear the devices carried in these positions. Therefore, in order to prevent these problems, the main objective of this work is designing and recollecting a new dataset about falls, falling risks and activities of daily living using an ankle-placed device obtaining a good balance between the different activity types. This dataset will be a useful tool for researchers who want to integrate the fall detector in the footwear. Thus, in this work we design the fall-detection device, study the suitable activities to be collected, collect the dataset from 21 users performing the studied activities and evaluate the quality of the collected dataset. As an additional and secondary study, we implement a simple Deep Learning classifier based on this data to prove the system's feasibility."

However, the large-scale preparation of low-cost, high-sensitivity piezoresistive sensors still face huge challenges. Inspired by the specific structures and excellent metal conductivity of a family of two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal carbides and nitrides (MXene) and the high-performance sensing effect of human skin including randomly distributed microstructural receptors, we fabricate a highly sensitive MXene-based piezoresistive sensor with bioinspired microspinous microstructures formed by a simple abrasive paper stencil printing process. The obtained piezoresistive sensor shows high sensitivity (151.4 kPa(-1)), relatively short response time (<130 ms), subtle pressure detection limit of 4.4 Pa, and excellent cycle stability over 10,000 cycles. The mechanism of the high sensitivity of the sensor is dynamically revealed from the structural perspective by means of in situ electron microscopy experiment and finite element simulation. Bioinspired microspinous microstructures can effectively improve the sensitivity of the pressure sensor and the limit of the detectable subtle pressure. In practice, the sensor shows great performance in monitoring human physiological signals, detecting quantitatively pressure distributions, and remote monitoring of intelligent robot motion in real time."

Close follow-up through remote patient monitoring can help detect adverse outcomes earlier or prevent them, closing the gap between hospital and home care. However, equipment is limited due to economic and human resource constraints. This issue raises the need for efficient risk estimation to provide clinicians with insights into the potential benefit of remote monitoring for each patient. Standard models, such as the EuroSCORE, predict the mortality risk before the surgery. While these are used and validated in real settings, the models lack information collected during or following the surgery, determinant to predict adverse outcomes occurring further in the future. This paper proposes a Clinical Decision Support System based on Machine Learning to estimate the risk of severe complications within 90 days following cardiothoracic surgery discharge, an innovative objective underexplored in the literature. Health records from a cardiothoracic surgery department regarding 5 045 patients (60.8% male) collected throughout ten years were used to train predictive models. Clinicians' insights contributed to improving data preparation and extending traditional pipeline optimization techniques, addressing medical Artificial Intelligence requirements. Two separate test sets were used to evaluate the generalizability, one derived from a patient-grouped 70/30 split and another including all surgeries from the last available year. The achieved Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve on these test sets was 69.5% and 65.3%, respectively. Also, additional testing was implemented to simulate a real-world use case considering the weekly distribution of remote patient monitoring resources post-discharge. Compared to the random resource allocation, the selection of patients with respect to the outputs of the proposed model was proven beneficial, as it led to a higher number of high-risk patients receiving remote monitoring equipment."

Such technology can have a significant impact on health screening, chronic disease management and remote monitoring. A common approach is to collect sensor data and corresponding labels from a clinical grade device (e.g., blood pressure cuff) and train deep learning models to map one to the other. Although well intentioned, this approach often ignores a principled analysis of whether the input sensor data have enough information to predict the desired metric. We analyze the task of predicting blood pressure from PPG pulse wave analysis. Our review of the prior work reveals that many papers fall prey to data leakage and unrealistic constraints on the task and preprocessing steps. We propose a set of tools to help determine if the input signal in question (e.g., PPG) is indeed a good predictor of the desired label (e.g., blood pressure). Using our proposed tools, we found that blood pressure prediction using PPG has a high multi-valued mapping factor of 33.2% and low mutual information of 9.8%. In comparison, heart rate prediction using PPG, a well-established task, has a very low multi-valued mapping factor of 0.75% and high mutual information of 87.7%. We argue that these results provide a more realistic representation of the current progress toward the goal of wearable blood pressure measurement via PPG pulse wave analysis.

Traditional clinic-based BP readings are typically measured infrequently and under standardized/resting conditions and therefore do not capture BP values during normal everyday activity. Therefore, current hypertension guidelines emphasize the importance of incorporating out-of-office BP measurement into strategies for hypertension diagnosis and management. However, conventional home and ambulatory BP monitoring devices use the upper-arm cuff oscillometric method and only provide intermittent BP readings under static conditions or in a limited number of situations. New innovations include technologies for BP estimation based on processing of sensor signals supported by artificial intelligence tools, technologies for remote monitoring, reporting and storage of BP data, and technologies for BP data interpretation and patient interaction designed to improve hypertension management (""digital therapeutics""). The number and volume of data relating to new devices/technologies is increasing rapidly and will continue to grow. This International Society of Hypertension position paper describes the new devices/technologies, presents evidence relating to new BP measurement techniques and related indices, highlights standard for the validation of new devices/technologies, discusses the reliability and utility of novel BP monitoring devices, the association of these metrics with clinical outcomes, and the use of digital therapeutics. It also highlights the challenges and evidence gaps that need to be overcome before these new technologies can be considered as a user-friendly and accurate source of novel BP data to inform clinical hypertension management strategies."

Upper limb recovery requires high repetitions of task-specific practice. Stroke survivors are often prescribed task practices at home to supplement rehabilitation therapy. A poor quality of task practices, such as the use of compensatory movement patterns, results in maladaptive neuroplasticity and suboptimal motor recovery. There currently lacks a tool for the remote monitoring of movement quality of stroke survivors' task practices at home. The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of classifying movement quality at home using a wearable IMU. Nineteen stroke survivors wore an IMU sensor on the paretic wrist and performed four functional upper limb tasks in the lab and later at home while videorecording themselves. The lab data served as reference data to classify home movement quality using dynamic time warping. Incorrect and correct movement quality was labeled by a therapist. The home task practice movement quality was classified with an accuracy of 92% and F1 score of 0.95 for all tasks combined. Movement types contributing to misclassification were further investigated. The results support the feasibility of a home movement quality monitoring system to assist with upper limb rehabilitation post stroke."

This study seeks to explore the cost structure of telemonitoring for the elderly with AH and T2D in primary care and identify factors influencing costs for potential future expansions. METHODS: Infrastructure, operational, patient participation, and out-of-pocket costs were determined using a bottom-up approach. Infrastructure costs were determined by dividing equipment and telemonitoring platform expenses by the number of participants. Operational and patient participation costs were determined by considering patient training time, data measurement/review time, and teleconsultation time. The change in out-of-pocket costs was assessed in both groups using a structured questionnaire and 12-month expenditure data. Statistical analysis employed an unpaired sample t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, and chi-square test. RESULTS: A total of 117 patients aged 71.4±4.7 years were included in the study. The telemonitoring intervention incurred an annual infrastructure costs of €489.4 and operational costs of €97.3 (95% CI 85.7-109.0) per patient. Patient annual participation costs were €215.6 (95% CI 190.9-241.1). Average annual out-of-pocket costs for both groups were €345 (95% CI 221-469). After 12 months the telemonitoring group reported significantly lower out-of-pocket costs (€132 vs. €545, p<0.001), driven by reduced spending on food, dietary supplements, medical equipment, and specialist check-ups compared to the standard care group. CONCLUSION: To optimise the cost structure of telemonitoring, strategies like shortening the telemonitoring period, developing a national telemonitoring platform, using patient devices, integrating artificial intelligence into platforms, and involving nurse practitioners as telemedicine centre coordinators should be explored."

Most existing models in this field have been developed temperature screening methods using RCNN, face temperature encoder (FTE), and a combination of data from wearable sensors for predicting respiratory rate (RR) and monitoring blood pressure. These methods aim to facilitate remote screening and monitoring of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and COVID-19. However, these models require inadequate computing resources and are not suitable for lightweight environments. We propose a multimodal screening framework that leverages deep learning-inspired data fusion models to enhance screening results. A Variation Encoder (VEN) design proposes to measure skin temperature using Regions of Interest (RoI) identified by YoLo. Subsequently, the multi-data fusion model integrates electronic records features with data from wearable human sensors. To optimize computational efficiency, a data reduction mechanism is added to eliminate unnecessary features. Furthermore, we employ a contingent probability method to estimate distinct feature weights for each cluster, deepening our understanding of variations in thermal and sensory data to assess the prediction of abnormal COVID-19 instances. Simulation results using our lab dataset demonstrate a precision of 95.2%, surpassing state-of-the-art models due to the thoughtful design of the multimodal data-based feature fusion model, weight prediction factor, and feature selection model."

This study investigates the viability of using an ear-worn motion sensor for classifying daily activities, including lying, sitting/standing, walking, ascending stairs, descending stairs, and running. Fifty healthy participants (between 20 and 47 years old) engaged in these activities while under monitoring. Various machine learning algorithms, ranging from interpretable shallow models to state-of-the-art deep learning approaches designed for HAR (i.e., DeepConvLSTM and ConvTransformer), were employed for classification. The results demonstrate the ear sensor's efficacy, with deep learning models achieving a 98% accuracy rate of classification. The obtained classification models are agnostic regarding which ear the sensor is worn and robust against moderate variations in sensor orientation (e.g., due to differences in auricle anatomy), meaning no initial calibration of the sensor orientation is required. The study underscores the ear's efficacy as a suitable site for monitoring human daily activity and suggests its potential for combining HAR with in-ear vital sign monitoring. This approach offers a practical method for comprehensive health monitoring by integrating sensors in a single anatomical location. This integration facilitates individualized health assessments, with potential applications in tele-monitoring, personalized health insights, and optimizing athletic training regimes."

We investigated differences in prognosis and candidate immune biomarkers in patients with unknown compared with those with known primary melanoma enrolled in the E1609 adjuvant trial that tested ipilimumab at 3 and 10 mg/kg vs high-dose interferon-alfa (HDI). PATIENTS AND METHODS: MUP status was defined as initial presentation with cutaneous, nodal or distant metastasis without a known primary. Relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Stratified (by stage) log-rank test was used to compare RFS and OS by primary tumor status. Gene expression profiling (GEP) was performed on the tumor biopsies of a subset of patients. Similarly, peripheral blood samples were tested for candidate soluble and cellular immune biomarkers. RESULTS: MUP cases represented 12.8% of the total population (N=1699) including 11.7% on the ipilimumab arms and 14.7% on the HDI arm. Stratifying by stage, RFS (p=0.001) and overall survival (OS) (p=0.009) showed outcomes significantly better for patients with unknown primary. The primary tumor status remained prognostically significant after adjusting for treatment and stage in multivariate Cox proportional hazards models. Including only ipilimumab-treated patients, RFS (p=0.005) and OS (p=0.023) were significantly better in favor of those with unknown primary. Among patients with GEP data (n=718; 102 MUP, 616 known), GEP identified pathways and genes related to autoimmunity, inflammation, immune cell infiltration and immune activation that were significantly enriched in the MUP tumors compared with known primaries. Further investigation into infiltrating immune cell types estimated significant enrichment with CD8 +and CD4+T cells, B cells and NK cells as well as significantly higher major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I and MHC-II scores in MUP compared with known primary. Among patients tested for circulating biomarkers (n=321; 66 unknown and 255 known), patients with MUP had significantly higher circulating levels of IL-2R (p=0.04). CONCLUSION: Patients with MUP and high-risk melanoma had significantly better prognosis and evidence of significantly enhanced immune activation within the TME and the circulation, supporting the designation of MUP as a distinct prognostic marker in patients with high-risk melanoma."

However, integrating HAR models in safety-critical applications requires trust, and recent approaches have aimed to balance the performance of deep learning models with explainable decision-making for complex activity recognition. Prior works have exploited the compositionality of complex HAR (i.e., higher-level activities composed of lower-level activities) to form models with symbolic interfaces, such as concept-bottleneck architectures, that facilitate inherently interpretable models. However, feature engineering for symbolic concepts-as well as the relationship between the concepts-requires precise annotation of lower-level activities by domain experts, usually with fixed time windows, all of which induce a heavy and error-prone workload on the domain expert. In this paper, we introduce X-CHAR , an eXplainable Complex Human Activity Recognition model that doesn't require precise annotation of low-level activities, offers explanations in the form of human-understandable, high-level concepts, while maintaining the robust performance of end-to-end deep learning models for time series data. X-CHAR learns to model complex activity recognition in the form of a sequence of concepts. For each classification, X-CHAR outputs a sequence of concepts and a counterfactual example as the explanation. We show that the sequence information of the concepts can be modeled using Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss without having accurate start and end times of low-level annotations in the training dataset-significantly reducing developer burden. We evaluate our model on several complex activity datasets and demonstrate that our model offers explanations without compromising the prediction accuracy in comparison to baseline models. Finally, we conducted a mechanical Turk study to show that the explanations provided by our model are more understandable than the explanations from existing methods for complex activity recognition."

Despite the various studies found in the literature, some elements are still not well addressed, such as the study cohort, the experimental protocol, the type of research design, as well as the relevant features in this context. To this end, the objective of this pilot study was to investigate the efficacy of data-driven systems to characterize older individuals over 80 years of age with impaired physical function, during their daily routine and under unsupervised conditions. We propose a fully automated process which extracts a set of heterogeneous time-domain features from 24-hour files of acceleration and barometric data. After being statistically tested, the most discriminant features fed a group of machine learning classifiers to distinguish frail from non-frail subjects, achieving an accuracy up to 93.51%. Our analysis, conducted over 570 days of recordings, shows that a longitudinal study is important while using the proposed features, in order to ensure a highly specific diagnosis. This work may serve as a basis for the paradigm of future monitoring systems."

For continuous monitoring, widespread use, and prevention of cardiac events, advanced wearable technologies are emerging as promising surrogates for conventional 12‑lead electrocardiogram (ECG) QT interval assessment. Previous studies have shown a good agreement between QT and corrected QT (QTc) intervals measured on a smartwatch ECG and a 12-lead ECG, but the clinical accuracy of computerized algorithms for QT and QTc interval measurement from smartwatch ECGs is unclear. OBJECTIVE: The prospective observational study compared the smartwatch-recorded QT and QTc assessed using AccurKardia's AccurBeat platform with the conventional 12‑lead ECG annotated manually by a cardiologist. METHODS: ECGs were collected from healthy participants (without any known cardiovascular disease) aged >22 years. Two consecutive 30-second ECG readings followed by (within 15 minutes) a 10-second standard 12-lead ECG were recorded for each participant. Characteristics of the participants were compared by sex using a 2-sample t test and Wilcoxon rank sum test. Statistical comparisons of heart rate (HR), QT interval, and QTc interval between the platform and the 12-lead ECG, ECG lead I, and ECG lead II were done using the Wilcoxon sign rank test. Linear regression was used to predict QTc and QT intervals from the ECG based on the platform's QTc/QT intervals with adjustment for age, sex, and difference in HR measurement. The Bland-Altman method was used to check agreement between various QT and QTc interval measurements. RESULTS: A total of 50 participants (32 female, mean age 46 years, SD 1 year) were included in the study. The result of the regression model using the platform measurements to predict the 12-lead ECG measurements indicated that, in univariate analysis, QT/QTc intervals from the platform significantly predicted QT/QTc intervals from the 12-lead ECG, ECG lead I, and ECG lead II, and this remained significant after adjustment for sex, age, and change in HR. The Bland-Altman plot results found that 96% of the average QTc interval measurements between the platform and QTc intervals from the 12-lead ECG were within the 95% confidence limit of the average difference between the two measurements, with a mean difference of -10.5 (95% limits of agreement -71.43, 50.43). A total of 94% of the average QT interval measurements between the platform and the 12-lead ECG were within the 95% CI of the average difference between the two measurements, with a mean difference of -6.3 (95% limits of agreement -54.54, 41.94). CONCLUSIONS: QT and QTc intervals obtained by a smartwatch coupled with the platform's assessment were comparable to those from a 12-lead ECG. Accordingly, with further refinements, remote monitoring using this technology holds promise for the identification of QT interval prolongation."

This article presents a novel architecture that integrates PUF, blockchain, and Tangle for Security-by-Design (SbD) of healthcare cyber-physical systems (H-CPSs). Healthcare systems around the world have undergone massive technological transformation and have seen growing adoption with the advancement of Internet-of-Medical Things (IoMT). The technological transformation of healthcare systems to telemedicine, e-health, connected health, and remote health is being made possible with the sophisticated integration of IoMT with machine learning, big data, artificial intelligence (AI), and other technologies. As healthcare systems are becoming more accessible and advanced, security and privacy have become pivotal for the smooth integration and functioning of various systems in H-CPSs. In this work, we present a novel approach that integrates PUF with IOTA Tangle and blockchain and works by storing the PUF keys of a patient's Body Area Network (BAN) inside blockchain to access, store, and share globally. Each patient has a network of smart wearables and a gateway to obtain the physiological sensor data securely. To facilitate communication among various stakeholders in healthcare systems, IOTA Tangle's Masked Authentication Messaging (MAM) communication protocol has been used, which securely enables patients to communicate, share, and store data on Tangle. The MAM channel works in the restricted mode in the proposed architecture, which can be accessed using the patient's gateway PUF key. Furthermore, the successful verification of PUF enables patients to securely send and share physiological sensor data from various wearable and implantable medical devices embedded with PUF. Finally, healthcare system entities like physicians, hospital admin networks, and remote monitoring systems can securely establish communication with patients using MAM and retrieve the patient's BAN PUF keys from the blockchain securely. Our experimental analysis shows that the proposed approach successfully integrates three security primitives, PUF, blockchain, and Tangle, providing decentralized access control and security in H-CPS with minimal energy requirements, data storage, and response time."

A nomogram based on clinicopathological features (clinicopathological-feature model) and a nomogram based on the multi-feature fusion model were constructed based on BC patients with DM (n=67) and matched patients (n=134) without DM. DM was diagnosed on average (17.31±13.12) months after diagnosis. The clinicopathological-feature model included seven features: reproductive history, lymph node metastasis, estrogen receptor status, progesterone receptor status, CA153, CEA, and endocrine therapy. The multi-feature fusion model included the same features and an additional three MRI features (multiple masses, fat-saturated T2WI signal, and mass size). The multi-feature fusion model was relatively better at predicting DM. The sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic accuracy and AUC of the multi-feature fusion model were 0.746 (95% CI: 0.623-0.841), 0.806 (0.727-0.867), 0.786 (0.723-0.841), and 0.854 (0.798-0.911), respectively. Both internal and external validations suggested good generalizability of the multi-feature fusion model to the clinic. The incorporation of MRI factors significantly improved the specificity and sensitivity of the nomogram. The constructed multi-feature fusion nomogram may guide DM screening and the implementation of prophylactic treatment for BC."

METHODS: One to two doctors and nurses (in the department on that day) from public hospitals in 88 counties and urban areas in 9 cities of Guizhou Province were enrolled of field investigation. The questionnaires form were filled in on-site and sorted out and analyzed by special personnel. RESULTS: A total of 297 medical staff from the department of critical care medicine of 146 hospitals were included. All the questionnaires were filled in with their real names, including 152 doctors and 145 nurses. There were 24 class III Grade A hospitals and 122 class II and all the hospitals had implemented digital information management.

From 2018 to 2020, the total number of patients admitted to the intensive care unit of the hospital was 50 473, 57 565 and 57 907, respectively, of which the number of patients over 65 years old accounted for 37.47%, 41.26% and 43.31%, respectively (all P > 0.05). There were 4 242 cases of remote consultation using big data Internet in the department every year, with a median of 257.50 (96.50, 958.25) cases. 12.12% of the departments had independent critical monitoring systems, and 8.75% of them could capture data automatically to form tables. 96.30% of the medical staff participated in systematic and professional training on basic knowledge, basic theory and basic medical care skills through the Internet platform, and the number of meetings, studies and training in the provinces and prefectures were 282 and 357 times per year, respectively. More than 90% of the departments initiated remote consultation, arranged referral or admitted patients who had improved status after treatment in superior hospitals through the Internet platform. Most of the patients (69.02%) were from the lower level of the hospital. The total number of out-patient consultations was 2 959 times per year, with a median of 296 (185 473) times. 54.79% of the departments had fixed service villages, and 28.08% of the departments had fixed service population. The median furthest visit distance was 52.5 (30.0, 80.0) kilometers, and the median average visit distance was 30.0 (20.0, 50.0) kilometers. 54.88% of medical staff believed that the biggest difficulties encountered during house visits were insufficient energy and too large service groups or regions. More than 90% of medical staff had been exposed to cloud learning and cloud training, and most of the surveyed medical staff believed that cloud learning and cloud training greatly improved medical service capacity and service efficiency of medical institutions (71.04% and 67.01%, respectively). Meanwhile, they believe that ""Internet+health big data"" projects from various aspects brought advantage to medical institutions, but there are also low utilization rate of Internet medical equipment by village doctors, low acceptance for telemedicine and mobile hospitals by farmers. CONCLUSIONS: Guizhou public hospitals have implementation of digital information management at the grass-roots level, the surveyed health care workers have a relatively low awareness of the digital information management system, hospital use big data Internet for remote consultation is uneven, intensive care medicine is a clinical discipline used in most remote consultation information system, and can complete two-way referrals. In the past three years, the discipline operation showed an upward trend year by year. Medical staff use artificial intelligence devices such as cloud learning and training to improve medical service capacity and efficiency. The digital transformation of primary hospitals is being continuously improved."

A total of 195 features, including the proposed ones and those already known in the literature, have been calculated on a set composed of 50,000 pulses from 1080 different patients. Three feature selection methods, namely Correlation-based Feature Selection (CFS), RReliefF and Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (MRMR), have then been applied to identify the most significant features for BP estimation. Some of these features have been extracted through a novel PPG signal enhancement method based on the use of the Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform (MODWT). As a matter of fact, the enhanced signal leads to a reliable identification of the characteristic points of the PPG signal (e.g., systolic, diastolic and dicrotic notch points) by simple means, obtaining results comparable with those from purposely defined algorithms. For systolic points, mean and std of errors computed as the difference between the locations obtained using a purposely defined already known algorithm and those using the MODWT enhancement are, respectively, 0.0097 s and 0.0202 s; for diastolic points they are, respectively, 0.0441 s and 0.0486 s; for dicrotic notch points they are 0.0458 s and 0.0896 s. Hence, this study leads to the selection of several new features from the MODWT enhanced signal on every single pulse extracted from PPG signals, in addition to features already known in the literature. These features can be employed to train machine learning (ML) models useful for estimating systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in a non-invasive way, which is suitable for telemedicine health-care monitoring."

The Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) SOPHIA (Stratification of Obesity Phenotypes to Optimize Future Obesity Therapy) project is part of a momentum shift aiming to provide better tools for the stratification of people with obesity according to disease risk and treatment response. One of the challenges to achieving these goals is that many clinical cohorts are siloed, limiting the potential of combined data for biomarker discovery. In SOPHIA, we have addressed this challenge by setting up a federated database building on open-source DataSHIELD technology. The database currently federates 16 cohorts that are accessible via a central gateway. The database is multi-modal, including research studies, clinical trials, and routine health data, and is accessed using the R statistical programming environment where statistical and machine learning analyses can be performed at a distance without any disclosure of patient-level data. We demonstrate the use of the database by providing a proof-of-concept analysis, performing a federated linear model of BMI and systolic blood pressure, pooling all data from 16 studies virtually without any analyst seeing individual patient-level data. This analysis provided similar point estimates compared to a meta-analysis of the 16 individual studies. Our approach provides a benchmark for reproducible, safe federated analyses across multiple study types provided by multiple stakeholders."

Despite its severity, its diagnosis largely relies on the proficiency of health care professionals. At present, the real-time identification of paroxysmal AF is hindered by the lack of automated techniques. Consequently, a highly effective machine learning algorithm specifically designed for AF detection could offer substantial clinical benefits. We hypothesized that machine learning algorithms have the potential to identify and extract features of AF with a high degree of accuracy, given the intricate and distinctive patterns present in electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings of AF. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop a clinically valuable machine learning algorithm that can accurately detect AF and compare different leads' performances of AF detection. METHODS: We used 12-lead ECG recordings sourced from the 2020 PhysioNet Challenge data sets. The Welch method was used to extract power spectral features of the 12-lead ECGs within a frequency range of 0.083 to 24.92 Hz. Subsequently, various machine learning techniques were evaluated and optimized to classify sinus rhythm (SR) and AF based on these power spectral features. Furthermore, we compared the effects of different frequency subbands and different lead selections on machine learning performances. RESULTS: The light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) was found to be the most effective in classifying AF and SR, achieving an average F(1)-score of 0.988 across all ECG leads. Among the frequency subbands, the 0.083 to 4.92 Hz range yielded the highest F(1)-score of 0.985. In interlead comparisons, aVR had the highest performance (F(1)=0.993), with minimal differences observed between leads. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, this study successfully used machine learning methodologies, particularly the LightGBM model, to differentiate SR and AF based on power spectral features derived from 12-lead ECGs. The performance marked by an average F(1)-score of 0.988 and minimal interlead variation underscores the potential of machine learning algorithms to bolster real-time AF detection. This advancement could significantly improve patient care in intensive care units as well as facilitate remote monitoring through wearable devices, ultimately enhancing clinical outcomes."

Results showed that macro-algae and cuttlebone (2 %) were the best natural bio-sorbent. Additionally, the selected halotolerant strain able to rapidly remove dye was identified as Shewanella algae B29. The optimization process revealed that decolourization of CI Reactive Red 66 yields reached 91.04 % under the following variable values: dyes concentration (100 mg/l), salinity (30 g/l), peptone (2 %), pH (5), algae C (3 %), cuttlebone (1.5 %) and agitation (150 rpm).

Two Cases.,Switzerland,"BACKGROUND: In the dental field, digital technology has created new opportunities for orthodontists to integrate their clinical practice, and for patients to collect information about orthodontics and their treatment, which is called ""teledentistry."" Dental monitoring (DM) is a recently introduced orthodontic application that combines safe teledentistry with artificial intelligence (AI) using a knowledge-based algorithm, allowing an accurate semi-automatic monitoring of the treatment. Dental Monitoring is the world's first SaaS (Software as a Service) application designed for remote monitoring of dental treatment, developed in Paris, France, with Philippe Salah as the Co-founder and CEO. CASES PRESENTATION: This report describes two cases in which DM system was essential to achieve the control of certain movements: it was possible to follow the movement, even if complex, such as the anterior cross of an adult patient and a lack of space in the canine of the growing patient. The software analyzed the fit and retention of the aligner, thus ensuring correct biomechanics. They were treated during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown with aligners. The first case is a growing patient who was monitored during an interceptive orthodontic treatment to manage a retained upper canine. The second case is an adult patient forced to finalize his treatment of upper lateral incisor crossbite. The software analyzed the fit and retention of the aligner, thus ensuring correct biomechanics. CONCLUSIONS: DM system appears to be a promising method, useful for improving the interaction between doctor and patient, generally acceptable and useful to patients, even in critical clinical situations, at least in cases with optimal compliance and ability to use the tool properly."

Yet, this wealth of data is lacking for emerging, less intrusive modalities, such as ear-EEG. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: The current study seeks to harness the abundance of open-source scalp EEG datasets by applying models pre-trained on data, either directly or with minimal fine-tuning; this is achieved in the context of effective sleep analysis from ear-EEG data that was recorded using a single in-ear electrode, referenced to the ipsilateral mastoid, and developed in-house as described in our previous work. Unlike previous studies, our research uniquely focuses on an older cohort (17 subjects aged 65-83, mean age 71.8 years, some with health conditions), and employs LightGBM for transfer learning, diverging from previous deep learning approaches. RESULTS: Results show that the initial accuracy of the pre-trained model on ear-EEG was 70.1%, but fine-tuning the model with ear-EEG data improved its classification accuracy to 73.7%. The fine-tuned model exhibited a statistically significant improvement (p < 0.05, dependent t-test) for 10 out of the 13 participants, as reflected by an enhanced average Cohen's kappa score (a statistical measure of inter-rater agreement for categorical items) of 0.639, indicating a stronger agreement between automated and expert classifications of sleep stages. Comparative SHAP value analysis revealed a shift in feature importance for the N3 sleep stage, underscoring the effectiveness of the fine-tuning process. CONCLUSION: Our findings underscore the potential of fine-tuning pre-trained scalp EEG models on ear-EEG data to enhance classification accuracy, particularly within an older population and using feature-based methods for transfer learning. This approach presents a promising avenue for ear-EEG analysis in sleep studies, offering new insights into the applicability of transfer learning across different populations and computational techniques. CLINICAL IMPACT: An enhanced ear-EEG method could be pivotal in remote monitoring settings, allowing for continuous, non-invasive sleep quality assessment in elderly patients with conditions like dementia or sleep apnea."

Herein, a tough, self-healing, adhesive double network (DN) conductive hydrogel (named as OSA-(Gelatin/PAM)-Ca, O-(G/P)-Ca) was prepared by bridging gelatin and polyacrylamide network with functionalized polysaccharide (oxidized sodium alginate, OSA) through Schiff base reaction. Thanks to the presence of multiple interactions (Schiff base bond, hydrogen bond, and metal coordination) within the network, the prepared hydrogel showed outstanding mechanical properties (tensile strain of 2800 % and stress of 630 kPa), high conductivity (0.72 S/m), repeatable adhesion performance and excellent self-healing ability (83.6 %/79.0 % of the original tensile strain/stress after self-healing). Moreover, the hydrogel-based sensor exhibited high strain sensitivity (GF = 3.66) and fast response time (<0.5 s), which can be used to monitor a wide range of human physiological signals. Based on this, excellent compression sensitivity (GF = 0.41 kPa(-1) in the range of 90-120 kPa), a three-dimensional (3D) array of flexible sensor was designed to monitor the intensity of pressure and spatial force distribution. In addition, a gel-based wearable sensor was accurately classified and recognized ten types of gestures, achieving an accuracy rate of >96.33 % both before and after self-healing under three machine learning models (the decision tree, SVM, and KNN). This paper provides a simple method to prepare tough and self-healing conductive hydrogel as flexible multifunctional sensor devices for versatile applications in fields such as healthcare monitoring, human-computer interaction, and artificial intelligence."

However, traditional manual lifestyle coaching models significantly limit availability due to high operating costs and personnel requirements. Furthermore, the lack of patient lifestyle monitoring and clinician time constraints can prevent personalized coaching on lifestyle modifications. OBJECTIVE: This study assesses the effectiveness of a fully digital, autonomous, and artificial intelligence (AI)-based lifestyle coaching program on achieving BP control among adults with hypertension. METHODS: Participants were enrolled in a single-arm nonrandomized trial in which they received a BP monitor and wearable activity tracker. Data were collected from these devices and a questionnaire mobile app, which were used to train personalized machine learning models that enabled precision lifestyle coaching delivered to participants via SMS text messaging and a mobile app. The primary outcomes included (1) the changes in systolic and diastolic BP from baseline to 12 and 24 weeks and (2) the percentage change of participants in the controlled, stage-1, and stage-2 hypertension categories from baseline to 12 and 24 weeks. Secondary outcomes included (1) the participant engagement rate as measured by data collection consistency and (2) the number of manual clinician outreaches. RESULTS: In total, 141 participants were monitored over 24 weeks. At 12 weeks, systolic and diastolic BP decreased by 5.6 mm Hg (95% CI -7.1 to -4.2; P<.001) and 3.8 mm Hg (95% CI -4.7 to -2.8; P<.001), respectively. Particularly, for participants starting with stage-2 hypertension, systolic and diastolic BP decreased by 9.6 mm Hg (95% CI -12.2 to -6.9; P<.001) and 5.7 mm Hg (95% CI -7.6 to -3.9; P<.001), respectively. At 24 weeks, systolic and diastolic BP decreased by 8.1 mm Hg (95% CI -10.1 to -6.1; P<.001) and 5.1 mm Hg (95% CI -6.2 to -3.9; P<.001), respectively. For participants starting with stage-2 hypertension, systolic and diastolic BP decreased by 14.2 mm Hg (95% CI -17.7 to -10.7; P<.001) and 8.1 mm Hg (95% CI -10.4 to -5.7; P<.001), respectively, at 24 weeks. The percentage of participants with controlled BP increased by 17.2% (22/128; P<.001) and 26.5% (27/102; P<.001) from baseline to 12 and 24 weeks, respectively. The percentage of participants with stage-2 hypertension decreased by 25% (32/128; P<.001) and 26.5% (27/102; P<.001) from baseline to 12 and 24 weeks, respectively. The average weekly participant engagement rate was 92% (SD 3.9%), and only 5.9% (6/102) of the participants required manual outreach over 24 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates the potential of fully digital, autonomous, and AI-based lifestyle coaching to achieve meaningful BP improvements and high engagement for patients with hypertension while substantially reducing clinician workloads.

To address the gap, a wireless handheld telestration device was developed to facilitate dynamic user interaction with live video streams. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to find the perceived usability, ergonomics, and educational value of a first-generation handheld wireless telestration platform. METHODS: A prototype was developed with four core hand-held functions: (1) free-hand annotation, (2) cursor navigation, (3) overlay and manipulation (rotation) of ghost (avatar) instrumentation, and (4) hand-held video feed navigation on a remote monitor. This device uses a proprietary augmented reality platform. Surgeons and trainees were invited to test the core functions of the platform by performing standardized tasks. Usability and ergonomics were evaluated with a validated system usability scale and a 5-point Likert scale survey, which also evaluated the perceived educational value of the device. RESULTS: In total, 10 people (9 surgeons and 1 senior resident; 5 male and 5 female) participated. Participants strongly agreed or agreed (SA/A) that it was easy to perform annotations (SA/A 9, 90% and neutral 0, 0%), video feed navigation (SA/A 8, 80% and neutral 1, 10%), and manipulation of ghost (avatar) instruments on the monitor (SA/A 6, 60% and neutral 3, 30%). Regarding ergonomics, 40% (4) of participants agreed or strongly agreed (neutral 4, 40%) that the device was physically comfortable to use and hold. These results are consistent with open-ended comments on the device's size and weight. The average system usability scale was 70 (SD 12.5; median 75, IQR 63-84) indicating an above average usability score. Participants responded favorably to the device's perceived educational value, particularly for postoperative coaching (agree 6, 60%, strongly agree 4, 40%). CONCLUSIONS: This study presents the preliminary usability results of a novel first-generation telestration tool customized for use in surgical coaching. Favorable usability and perceived educational value were reported. Future iterations of the device should focus on incorporating user feedback and additional studies should be conducted to evaluate its effectiveness for improving surgical education. Ultimately, such tools can be incorporated into pedagogical models of surgical coaching to optimize feedback and training."

The discharge of effluents containing methyl orange (MO) dye and Cu(2+) ions into water is harmful because they have severe toxic effects to humans and the aquatic ecosystem. The dried algal biomass was used as a sustainable, cost-effective and eco-friendly for the treatment of the textile wastewater. Box-Behnken design (BBD) was used to identify the most significant factors for achieving maximum biosorption of Cu(2+) and MO from aqueous solutions using marine alga Fucus vesiculosus biomass. The experimental results indicated that 3 g/L of F. vesiculosus biomass was capable of removing 92.76% of copper and 50.27% of MO simultaneously from aqueous solution using MO (60 mg/L), copper (200 mg/L) at pH 7 within 60 min with agitation at 200 rpm. The dry biomass was also investigated using SEM, EDS, and FTIR before and after MO and copper biosorption. FTIR, EDS and SEM analyses revealed obvious changes in the characteristics of the algal biomass as a result of the biosorption process. The dry biomass of F. vesiculosus can eliminate MO and copper ions from aquatic effluents in a feasible and efficient method."

We also investigated the characteristics of patient interactions with wearable seizure alerts. METHODS: We analyzed wristband data from patients with TCSs who had at least three reported TCSs over a minimum of 90 days. We quantified TCS frequency and cycles, and the relationship between the mean and variability of monthly TCS counts. We also assessed interaction metrics such as false alarm dismissal and seizure confirmation rates. RESULTS: Applying strict criteria for usable data, we reviewed 137 490 TCSs from 3012 patients, with a median length of TCS alert records of 445 days (range = 90-1806). Analyses showed consistency between prior diary studies and the present data concerning (1) the distribution of monthly TCS frequency (median = 3.1, range = .08-26); (2) the linear relationship (slope = .79, R(2) = .83) between the logarithm of the mean and the logarithm of the SD of monthly TCS frequency (L-relationship); and (iii) the prevalence of multiple coexisting seizure cycles, including circadian (84.0%), weekly (24.6%), and long-term cycles (31.1%). SIGNIFICANCE: Key population-level patterns in seizure occurrence are recapitulated in wrist-worn device recordings, supporting their validity for tracking TCS burden. Compared to other approaches, wearables can provide noninvasive, objective, long-term data, revealing cycles in seizure risk. However, improved patient engagement with wristband alerts and further validation of detection accuracy in ambulatory settings are needed. Together, these findings suggest that data from smart wristbands may be used to derive features of TCS records and, ultimately, facilitate remote monitoring and the development of personalized forecasting tools for TCS management. Our findings may not generalize to other types of seizures."

Healthcare industries have become a prime example where the Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT) is making significant progress, particularly in how we approach real-time patient care. Traditional systems for monitoring older people and people with special needs are frequently expensive, require a large workforce, and fall short of providing real-time data. This paper introduces the '3-Tier Health Care Architecture,' an integrated approach to mitigating these issues. This architecture capitalizes on IoHT technologies and is constructed around three principal tiers: Sensor, Fog, and Cloud. The Sensor Tier employs Health Metrics Acquisition Units (HMAUs) fitted with an nRF5340 Development Kit, capturing an extensive range of health-related metrics via wearable sensors. These metrics are then relayed to the Local Processing Units (LPUs) in Fog Tier, which operates on Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W microprocessors for the initial data processing before forwarding to the cloud. The Cloud Tier uses a hybrid CNN-LSTM Machine Learning (ML) model to perform Real-Time Healthcare Monitoring (RTHM) status assessments and includes an Early Warning System for immediate alert issuance. The proposed architecture is resilient, scalable, and efficient, serving as a fortified and all-encompassing solution for RTHM.

In healthcare contexts such as nursing homes, it is crucial to employ plausible and non-invasive methods for human mesh reconstruction that preserve privacy and dignity. Traditional vision-based techniques encounter challenges related to occlusion, viewpoint limitations, lighting conditions, and privacy concerns. In this research, we present CAvatar, a real-time human mesh reconstruction approach that innovatively utilizes pressure maps recorded by a tactile carpet as input. This advanced, non-intrusive technology obviates the need for cameras during usage, thereby safeguarding privacy. Our approach addresses several challenges, such as the limited spatial resolution of tactile sensors, extracting meaningful information from noisy pressure maps, and accommodating user variations and multiple users. We have developed an attention-based deep learning network, complemented by a discriminator network, to predict 3D human pose and shape from 2D pressure maps with notable accuracy. Our model demonstrates promising results, with a mean per joint position error (MPJPE) of 5.89 cm and a per vertex error (PVE) of 6.88 cm.

Various wearable IoT devices have emerged for detecting, diagnosing, and quantifying PD, predominantly utilizing inertial sensors and computational algorithms. However, their proliferation poses novel challenges concerning security, privacy, connectivity, and power optimization. Clinically, continuous monitoring of patients’ motor function is imperative for optimizing Levodopa (L-dopa) dosage while mitigating adverse effects and motor activity decline.

While standardized neuropsychological tests are inconvenient for this purpose, wearable sensor technology collecting physiological and behavioral data looks promising to provide proxy measures of cognitive function. The objective of this study was to evaluate the predictive ability of digital physiological features, based on sensor data from wrist-worn wearables, in determining neuropsychological test scores in individuals with MCI. Methods: We used the dataset collected from a 10-week single-arm clinical trial in older adults (50–70 years old) diagnosed with amnestic MCI (N = 30) who received a digitally delivered multidomain therapeutic intervention. Cognitive performance was assessed before and after the intervention using the Neuropsychological Test Battery (NTB) from which composite scores were calculated (executive function, processing speed, immediate memory, delayed memory and global cognition). The Empatica E4, a wrist-wearable medical-grade device, was used to collect physiological data including blood volume pulse, electrodermal activity, and skin temperature. We processed sensors’ data and extracted a range of physiological features. We used interpolated NTB scores for 10-day intervals to test predictability of scores over short periods and to leverage the maximum of wearable data available. In addition, we used individually centered data which represents deviations from personal baselines. Supervised machine learning was used to train models predicting NTB scores from digital physiological features and demographics. Performance was evaluated using “leave-one-subject-out” and “leave-one-interval-out” cross-validation. Results: The final sample included 96 aggregated data intervals from 17 individuals. In total, 106 digital physiological features were extracted. We found that physiological features, especially measures of heart rate variability, correlated most strongly to the executive function compared to other cognitive composites. The model predicted the actual executive function scores with correlation r = 0.69 and intra-individual changes in executive function scores with r = 0.61.

These applications include remote healthcare monitoring, drug storage, alarm systems, and medical wearable devices. Remote patient monitoring, especially using wearable devices, has improved the health and protection of numerous people, while avoiding unnecessary hospital visits. Ideally, healthcare monitoring systems should accurately and timely detect if the patient is entering a critical condition, and alert the concerned doctor accordingly. However, in practice, there are two kinds of alarms raised by such systems, namely, events and anomalies. Events are non-erroneous data that do not conform to the expected values, indicating abnormality in the patient's condition. On the other hand, anomalies are erroneous data that may result from faulty sensors, electromagnetic interference, malicious attacks, or hardware tampering. These anomalies lead to false alarms which affect the decision making process and may cause danger to the patient's life. Traditionally, wearable MIoTs, measuring different vitals, frequently communicate with the patient's phone, or a local processing unit (LPU), in order to analyze and process the collected data. However, the increase in processing capabilities of IoT devices has made on-device event detection possible. This adds an extra layer of defense while avoiding unnecessary communication with LPU. In this paper, a healthcare monitoring system is proposed which compromises of two layers - (1) an online lightweight approach, based on multivariate long-short term memory (LSTM) autoencoder, embedded in each MIoT, that is able to detect data abnormality and alarms the LPU, (2) a correlation technique, at the LPU, that differentiates between anomalies and events, and alerts the patient's doctor only in case of an event. Since a single sensor reading does not provide enough clinical insight to detect the full length of an event, a feature engineering approach is implemented to extract interpretable statistical, dynamic and physiological features that provide the clinical insight needed. The proposed approach is simulated using Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) dataset for various vital signs, such as heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

It complicates 2% to 8% of all pregnancies and is one of the causes of more than 50,000 maternal deaths and over 500,000 fetal deaths worldwide annually. Adverse birth outcomes due to pregnancy complications have been associated with three delays: delay in recognizing the complication, delay in reaching an appropriate facility, and delay in receiving adequate care when the facility is reached. Thus prevention, timely detection, and care of pregnancy complications can prevent maternal deaths and morbidity. The Internet of Things (IoT) and machine learning (ML) technologies have become the new revolution of research in the field of healthcare. These technologies can be utilized to interconnect various sensors, monitor the health status of a patient, and predict the occurrence of an ailment. This study has designed and prototyped a pre-eclampsia monitoring model based on IoT and machine learning for remotely monitoring the health status of an expectant woman and her unborn child, to enhance early diagnosis of pre-eclampsia and improve birth outcomes. The study involved researching the on most appropriate biosensors and then designing and prototyping the pre-eclampsia watch. To build the pre-eclampsia prediction model the best ML algorithm was empirically analysed. A Naïve Bayes pre-eclampsia prediction model was found to perform better in identifying pregnant women who are at risk of pre-eclampsia after evaluation of various pre-eclampsia models built using decision trees, Naïve Bayes, K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM) and Artificial neural networks (ANN). Lastly, the predictive model was integrated with the pre-eclampsia model to assist in early diagnosis of pre-eclampsia. The prototype generates alerts when the expectant woman is at risk of Pre-eclampsia. The pre-eclampsia watch model can securely capture and transmit expectant women's vital to the cloud for processing and provide timely alerts when the woman is at risk.

Wearable Internet of Things (IoT) devices can reliably measure patients' heart rhythms by producing electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Due to their non-invasive nature, ECG signals have been frequently employed to detect arrhythmias. The manual procedure, however, takes a long time and is prone to error. Utilizing deep learning models for early automatic identification of cardiac arrhythmias is a preferable approach that will improve diagnosis and therapy. Though ECG analysis using cloud-based methods can perform satisfactorily, they still suffer from security issues. It is essential to provide secure data transmission and storage for IoT medical data because of its significant development in the healthcare system. So, this paper proposes a secure arrhythmia classification system with the help of effective encryption and a deep learning (DL) system. The proposed method mainly involved two phases: ECG signal transmission and arrhythmia disease classification. In the ECG signal transmission phase, the patient's ECG data collected through the IoT sensors is encrypted using the optimal key-based elgamal elliptic curve cryptography (OKEGECC) mechanism, and the encrypted data is securely transmitted to the cloud. After that, in the arrhythmia disease classification phase, the system collects the data from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology-Beth Israel Hospital (MIT-BIH) database to perform training. The collected data is preprocessed by applying the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to improve the quality of the ECG data. Next, the feature extraction is carried out by deformable attention-centered residual network 50 (DARNet-50), and finally, the classification is performed using butterfly-optimized Bi-directional long short-term memory (BOBLSTM).

The wearable sensors are responsible for sensing the psychological vitals of humans at different intervals to detect their precise health status. This article introduces an Interfering Input Classification Model (IICM) for addressing the continuous and discrete data extraction issues in RPM. The proposed model hybridizes whale optimization and deep-Q-learning for classification and connectivity identification between different interval data. The sensed information is segregated as discrete and continuous using the search process termination of the whales. Such classified data is validated for the maximum discreteness and its interconnection between the previous sequences. This interconnection is performed using Q-learning based on different state changes through continuous clinical range correlations. The proposed model exemplifies continuous and discrete signals (data) for abnormality detection and diagnosis recommendation.

This study investigates the viability of using an ear-worn motion sensor for classifying daily activities, including lying, sitting/standing, walking, ascending stairs, descending stairs, and running. Fifty healthy participants (between 20 and 47 years old) engaged in these activities while under monitoring. Various machine learning algorithms, ranging from interpretable shallow models to state-of-the-art deep learning approaches designed for HAR (i.e., DeepConvLSTM and ConvTransformer), were employed for classification. The results demonstrate the ear sensor’s efficacy, with deep learning models achieving a 98% accuracy rate of classification. The obtained classification models are agnostic regarding which ear the sensor is worn and robust against moderate variations in sensor orientation (e.g., due to differences in auricle anatomy), meaning no initial calibration of the sensor orientation is required. The study underscores the ear’s efficacy as a suitable site for monitoring human daily activity and suggests its potential for combining HAR with in-ear vital sign monitoring.

Thanks to the presence of multiple interactions (Schiff base bond, hydrogen bond, and metal coordination) within the network, the prepared hydrogel showed outstanding mechanical properties (tensile strain of 2800 % and stress of 630 kPa), high conductivity (0.72 S/m), repeatable adhesion performance and excellent self-healing ability (83.6 %/79.0 % of the original tensile strain/stress after self-healing). Moreover, the hydrogel-based sensor exhibited high strain sensitivity (GF = 3.66) and fast response time (<0.5 s), which can be used to monitor a wide range of human physiological signals. Based on this, excellent compression sensitivity (GF = 0.41 kPa−1 in the range of 90–120 kPa), a three-dimensional (3D) array of flexible sensor was designed to monitor the intensity of pressure and spatial force distribution. In addition, a gel-based wearable sensor was accurately classified and recognized ten types of gestures, achieving an accuracy rate of >96.33 % both before and after self-healing under three machine learning models (the decision tree, SVM, and KNN).

Such technology can have a significant impact on health screening, chronic disease management and remote monitoring. A common approach is to collect sensor data and corresponding labels from a clinical grade device (e.g., blood pressure cuff) and train deep learning models to map one to the other. Although well intentioned, this approach often ignores a principled analysis of whether the input sensor data have enough information to predict the desired metric. We analyze the task of predicting blood pressure from PPG pulse wave analysis. Our review of the prior work reveals that many papers fall prey to data leakage and unrealistic constraints on the task and preprocessing steps. We propose a set of tools to help determine if the input signal in question (e.g., PPG) is indeed a good predictor of the desired label (e.g., blood pressure). Using our proposed tools, we found that blood pressure prediction using PPG has a high multi-valued mapping factor of 33.2% and low mutual information of 9.8%. In comparison, heart rate prediction using PPG, a well-established task, has a very low multi-valued mapping factor of 0.75% and high mutual information of 87.7%.

Despite a growing arsenal of targeted medications, many rheumatology patients fail to achieve full remission. Assessing disease activity remains challenging, as patients prioritize different symptoms and disease phenotypes vary. This is also reflected in clinical trials where the efficacy of drugs is not necessarily measured in an optimal way with the traditional outcome assessment. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has catalyzed a digital transformation in healthcare, embracing telemonitoring and patient-reported data via apps and wearables. As a further driver of digital medicine, electronic medical record (EMR) providers are actively engaged in developing algorithms for clinical decision support, heralding a shift towards patient-centered, decentralized care. Machine learning algorithms have emerged as valuable tools for handling the increasing volume of patient data, promising to enhance treatment quality and patient well-being. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are particularly promising for radiological image analysis, aiding in the detection of specific lesions such as erosions, sacroiliitis, or osteoarthritis, with several FDA-approved applications. Clinical predictions, including numerical disease activity forecasts and medication choices, offer the potential to optimize treatment strategies. Numeric predictions can be integrated into clinical workflows, allowing for shared decision making with patients. Clustering patients based on disease characteristics provides a personalized care approach. Digital biomarkers, such as patient-reported outcomes and wearables data, offer insights into disease progression and therapy response more flexibly and outside patient consultations. In association with patient-reported outcomes, disease-specific digital biomarkers via image recognition or single-camera motion capture enables more efficient remote patient monitoring. Digital biomarkers may also play a major role in clinical trials in the future as continuous, disease-specific outcome measurement facilitating decentralized studies. Prediction models can help with patient selection in clinical trials, such as by predicting high disease activity. Efforts are underway to integrate these advancements into clinical workflows using digital pathways and remote patient monitoring platforms. In summary, machine learning, digital biomarkers, and advanced imaging technologies hold immense promise for enhancing clinical decision support and clinical trials in rheumatology.

This study seeks to explore the cost structure of telemonitoring for the elderly with AH and T2D in primary care and identify factors influencing costs for potential future expansions. Methods: Infrastructure, operational, patient participation, and out-of-pocket costs were determined using a bottom-up approach. Infrastructure costs were determined by dividing equipment and telemonitoring platform expenses by the number of participants. Operational and patient participation costs were determined by considering patient training time, data measurement/review time, and teleconsultation time. The change in out-of-pocket costs was assessed in both groups using a structured questionnaire and 12-month expenditure data. Statistical analysis employed an unpaired sample t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, and chi-square test. Results: A total of 117 patients aged 71.4±4.7 years were included in the study. The telemonitoring intervention incurred an annual infrastructure costs of €489.4 and operational costs of €97.3 (95% CI 85.7-109.0) per patient. Patient annual participation costs were €215.6 (95% CI 190.9-241.1). Average annual out-of-pocket costs for both groups were €345 (95% CI 221-469).

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the efficacy of an artificial intelligence-based heart failure detection model for peripartum cardiomyopathy detection. STUDY DESIGN: We first built a deep-learning model for heart failure detection using retrospective data at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center. Cases were adult and nonpregnant female patients with a heart failure diagnosis; controls were adult nonpregnant female patients without heart failure. The model was then tested on an independent cohort of pregnant women at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center with or without peripartum cardiomyopathy. We also tested the model in an external cohort of pregnant women at Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist. Key outcomes were assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. We also repeated our analysis using only lead I electrocardiogram as an input to assess the feasibility of remote monitoring via wearables that can capture single-lead electrocardiogram data. RESULTS: The University of Tennessee Health Science Center heart failure cohort comprised 346,339 electrocardiograms from 142,601 patients. In this cohort, 60% of participants were Black and 37% were White, with an average age (standard deviation) of 53 (19) years. The heart failure detection model achieved an area under the curve of 0.92 on the holdout set. We then tested the ability of the heart failure model to detect peripartum cardiomyopathy in an independent University of Tennessee Health Science Center cohort of pregnant women and an external Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist cohort of pregnant women. The independent University of Tennessee Health Science Center cohort included 158 electrocardiograms from 115 patients; our deep-learning model achieved an area under the curve of 0.83 (0.77–0.89) for this data set. The external Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist cohort involved 80 electrocardiograms from 43 patients; our deep-learning model achieved an area under the curve of 0.94 (0.91–0.98) for this data set. For identifying peripartum cardiomyopathy diagnosed ≥10 days after delivery, the model achieved an area under the curve of 0.88 (0.81–0.94) for the University of Tennessee Health Science Center cohort and of 0.96 (0.93–0.99) for the Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist cohort. When we repeated our analysis by building a heart failure detection model using only lead-I electrocardiograms, we obtained similarly high detection accuracies, with areas under the curve of 0.73 and 0.93 for the University of Tennessee Health Science Center and Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist cohorts, respectively. CONCLUSION: Artificial intelligence can accurately detect peripartum cardiomyopathy from electrocardiograms alone. A simple electrocardiographic artificial intelligence–based peripartum screening could result in a timelier diagnosis. Given that results with 1-lead electrocardiogram data were similar to those obtained using all 12 leads, future studies will focus on remote screening for peripartum cardiomyopathy using smartwatches that can capture single-lead electrocardiogram data. © 2024 Elsevier Inc."

As the “Internet of Things (IoT)” keeps on evolving, the application of IoT in the medical field is prominent these days. Utilizing IoT devices, alert messages can be sent directly to medical professionals in case of an emergency. So, monitoring the health condition of an individual using IoT technology has become a popular and beneficial method in today's contemporary medical field. With the help of mobile IoT medical equipment, the technology of smart Healthcare Monitoring System (HMS) is proliferating. By utilizing deep learning and IoT technology, the medical diagnosis system has evolved from direct face-to-face visits to the hospital to remote telemedicine method. Most of the data generated by the IoT wearable sensors are highly correlated and may consist of outliers. The extraction of the essential attributes from these data is a complicated task. So, “deep learning and machine learning” techniques are adapted to determine the most relevant and appropriate feature required for efficient diagnosis from the unstructured data produced by the IoT devices and thus help in minimizing the redundancy of unnecessary data. Fusing deep learning methods with healthcare IoT made only the essential details to be available for diagnosis. Therefore, a deep learning-oriented IoT-based HMS is executed in this work. With the support of several wearable healthcare devices, the required data are acquired. The encryption of the data acquired from standard sources using Optimal Key-based Advanced Encryption Standard (OK-AES) is carried out next to assure the security of the sensitive medical data. The keys for AES encryption are optimally chosen with the aid of the Enhanced Heap-Based Optimizer Algorithm (EHBOA). The encrypted data is transferred to the “cloud platform” for data storage. Once there is a need for the data, then the encrypted data is initially downloaded from the cloud platform. Then using the same AES scheme, the decryption of the data to attain the original data is carried out. From the retrieved data, the extraction of the crucial attributes is carried out. The extracted features are chosen in an optimized manner and are concatenated with the tuned weights to form the weighted feature matrix. This formulated weighted feature matrix is provided as input to the “Adaptive Dilated Transformer Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) with Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (ADTBi-LSTM-GRU) model.” The variables in the ADTBG are optimized using the EHBOA for providing an accurate classification outcome.

For this information to be interpretable, machine learning (ML) processes are necessary. Research question: Can a machine learning model successfully identify patients expected to have low gait speed in the early recovery period following joint replacement surgery? Methods: A commercial database from a smartphone-based care management platform passively collecting mobility data pre- and post-lower limb arthroplasty was used. We sought to create a ML model to predict gait speed recovery curves and identify patients at risk of poor gait speed outcome, a measure associated with range of motion and patient-reported outcomes. Model performance including sensitivity, specificity, precision, and accuracy were determined. Receiver operator curve (ROC) analysis was used to compare true and false positive rates. To benchmark our model, we compared threshold-based notifications based on the patient's current gait speed. Results: The performance of the predictive model was significantly improved compared to baseline of threshold-based exceptions using current gait speed. The ML model currently provides 53 % precision, 88 % accuracy, 36 % sensitivity, and 95 % specificity on the held-out test set. The ROC analysis suggests good clinical performance (AUC=0.81). Significance: Utilization of ML to predict gait recovery following total joint replacement is feasible and provides results with excellent specificity. This model will allow inclusion of additional data for retraining as patient populations evolve. Clinician feedback regarding notifications, including resulting actions and outcomes, can be used to further inform the model and improve clinical utility. © 2024 The Authors"

We tested various UWB setups, changed the number of anchors, and varied the tag placement (on the wrist or chest). Wrist-worn tags consistently outperformed chest-worn tags, and the nine-anchor configuration yielded the highest accuracy. Machine learning models were developed to classify activities based on UWB and IMU data. Models that included positional data significantly outperformed those that did not. The Random Forest model with a 4 s data window achieved an accuracy of 94%, compared to 79.2% when positional data were excluded.

Current diagnosis relies on subjective lung auscultation by physicians. Enabling this capability via a low-profile, objective wearable device for remote patient monitoring (RPM) could offer pre-emptive, accurate respiratory data to patients. With this goal as our aim, we used a low-profile accelerometer-based wearable system that utilizes deep learning to objectively detect wheezing along with respiration rate using a single sensor. The miniature patch consists of a sensitive wideband MEMS accelerometer and low-noise CMOS interface electronics on a small board, which was then placed on nine conventional lung auscultation sites on the patient’s chest walls to capture the pulmonary-induced vibrations (PIVs). A deep learning model was developed and compared with a deterministic time–frequency method to objectively detect wheezing in the PIV signals using data captured from 52 diverse patients with respiratory diseases. The wearable accelerometer patch, paired with the deep learning model, demonstrated high fidelity in capturing and detecting respiratory wheezes and patterns across diverse and pertinent settings. It achieved accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 95%, 96%, and 93%, respectively, with an AUC of 0.99 on the test set—outperforming the deterministic time–frequency approach.

The viscoelastic strain of stretchable materials often results in nonlinear stress−strain characteristics over a broad range of strains, consequently making the stretchable sensors at the body joints less accurate in predicting and recognizing human gestures. Accurate recognition of human gestures can be further deteriorated by environmental changes such as temperature and humidity. Here, we demonstrated an environment-adaptable high stress−strain linearity (up to ε = 150%) and high-durability (>100,000 cycles) stretchable sensor conformally laminated onto the body joints for human gesture recognition. The serpentine configuration of our ionic liquid-based stretchable film enabled us to construct broad data sets of mechanical strain and temperature changes for machine learning-based gesture recognition. Signal recognition and training of distinct strains and environmental stimuli using a machine learning-based algorithm analysis successfully measured and predicted the joint motion in a temperature-changing environment with an accuracy of 92.86% (R-squared).

Medical sensors record a variety of data and transmit them over the IoT network to facilitate remote patient monitoring. When a patient visits a hospital he may need to connect or disconnect medical devices from the medical healthcare system frequently. Also, multiple entities (e.g., doctors, medical staff, etc.) need access to patient data and require distinct sets of patient data. As a result of the dynamic nature of medical devices, medical users require frequent access to data, which raises complex security concerns. Granting access to a whole set of data creates privacy issues. Also, each of these medical user need to grant access rights to a specific set of medical data, which is quite a tedious task. In order to provide role-based access to medical users, this study proposes a blockchain-based framework for authenticating multiple entities based on the trust domain to reduce the administrative burden. This study is further validated by simulation on the infura blockchain using solidity and Python. The results demonstrate that role-based authorization and multi-entities authentication have been implemented and the owner of medical data can control access rights at any time and grant medical users easy access to a set of data in a healthcare system.

To improve convenience, outcomes, and enable more frequent monitoring of cancer recurrence, we propose using an implantable hydrogel sensor for remote cancer surveillance. Gold nanostars (GNS), efficient plasmonic nanomaterials, embedded in hydrogels, enhance Raman scattering signals of cancer biomarkers. A handheld Raman spectroscopy probe collects these signals, representing the unique vibrational molecular fingerprint. Toward this effort, this study demonstrates the performance of a GNS-embedded hydrogel for discriminating serum in two preclinical mouse prostate cancer models: NSG and C57BL/6J mice. GNS labeled with 4-mercaptobenzoic acid (4-MBA) were embedded in 70 µL hydrogels. Six serum samples from NSG mice (3 with LNCaP subcutaneous tumors, 3 normal) and eight serum samples from C57BL/6J mice (3 wild type, 5 transgenic modified–TRAMP with prostate cancer) were obtained. Serum (70 µL) was incubated overnight (4°C) with the hydrogel sample. Raman spectra were collected at five distinct locations using the Raman handheld probe. Spectral analysis involved intensity normalization, principal component analysis (PCA) for dimension reduction, and linear discriminate analysis (LDA) for classification with leave-one-spectra-out cross-validation. NSG mice exhibited band differences at 775-825 cm-1, 1202-1249 cm-1, and 1430-1478 cm-1 (LDA ROC AUC = 0.83), while C57BL/6J mice showed differences at 1152-1245 cm-1 and 1362-1407 cm-1 (LDA ROC AUC = 0.98).

Epilepsy, a chronic brain syndrome characterized by recurrent, unpredictable attacks, affects individuals of all ages. IoT-based seizure monitoring can greatly enhance seizure patients' quality of life. IoT device acquires patient data and transmits it to a computer program so that doctors can examine it. Currently, doctors invest significant manual effort in inspecting Electroencephalograph (EEG) signals to identify seizure activity. However, EEG-based seizure detection algorithms face challenges in real-world scenarios due to non-stationary EEG data and variable seizure patterns among patients and recording sessions. Therefore, a sophisticated computer-based approach is necessary to analyze complex EEG records. In this work, the authors proposed a hybrid approach by combining traditional convolution neural (CN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) along with an attention mechanism for the automatic recognition of epileptic seizures through EEG signal analysis. This attention mechanism focuses on significant subsets of EEG data for class recognition, resulting in improved model performance. The proposed methods are evaluated using a publicly available UCI epileptic seizure recognition dataset, which consists of five classes: four normal conditions and one abnormal seizure condition. Experimental results demonstrate that the suggested approach achieves an overall accuracy of 97.05% for the five-class EEG recognition data, with an accuracy of 99.52% for binary classification distinguishing seizure cases from normal instances.

Despite its severity, its diagnosis largely relies on the proficiency of health care professionals. At present, the real-time identification of paroxysmal AF is hindered by the lack of automated techniques. Consequently, a highly effective machine learning algorithm specifically designed for AF detection could offer substantial clinical benefits. We hypothesized that machine learning algorithms have the potential to identify and extract features of AF with a high degree of accuracy, given the intricate and distinctive patterns present in electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings of AF. Objective: This study aims to develop a clinically valuable machine learning algorithm that can accurately detect AF and compare different leads’ performances of AF detection. Methods: We used 12-lead ECG recordings sourced from the 2020 PhysioNet Challenge data sets. The Welch method was used to extract power spectral features of the 12-lead ECGs within a frequency range of 0.083 to 24.92 Hz. Subsequently, various machine learning techniques were evaluated and optimized to classify sinus rhythm (SR) and AF based on these power spectral features. Furthermore, we compared the effects of different frequency subbands and different lead selections on machine learning performances. Results: The light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) was found to be the most effective in classifying AF and SR, achieving an average F1-score of 0.988 across all ECG leads. Among the frequency subbands, the 0.083 to 4.92 Hz range yielded the highest F1-score of 0.985. In interlead comparisons, aVR had the highest performance (F1=0.993), with minimal differences observed between leads. Conclusions: In conclusion, this study successfully used machine learning methodologies, particularly the LightGBM model, to differentiate SR and AF based on power spectral features derived from 12-lead ECGs. The performance marked by an average F1-score of 0.988 and minimal interlead variation underscores the potential of machine learning algorithms to bolster real-time AF detection.

The provision of high-quality healthcare services requires a deep understanding of patients' needs, experiences, and preferences. Human activity recognition (HAR) is paramount in healthcare monitoring by using machine learning (ML), sensor data, and artificial intelligence (AI) to track and discern individuals' behaviours and physical movements. This technology allows healthcare professionals to remotely monitor patients, thereby ensuring they adhere to prescribed rehabilitation or exercise routines, and identify falls or anomalies, improving overall care and safety of the patient. HAR for healthcare monitoring, driven by deep learning (DL) algorithms, leverages neural networks and large quantities of sensor information to autonomously and accurately detect and track patients' behaviors and physical activities. DL-based HAR provides a cutting-edge solution for healthcare professionals to provide precise and more proactive interventions, reducing the burden on healthcare systems and improving patient well-being while increasing the overall quality of care.

Upper limb recovery requires high repetitions of task-specific practice. Stroke survivors are often prescribed task practices at home to supplement rehabilitation therapy. A poor quality of task practices, such as the use of compensatory movement patterns, results in maladaptive neuroplasticity and suboptimal motor recovery. There currently lacks a tool for the remote monitoring of movement quality of stroke survivors’ task practices at home. The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of classifying movement quality at home using a wearable IMU. Nineteen stroke survivors wore an IMU sensor on the paretic wrist and performed four functional upper limb tasks in the lab and later at home while videorecording themselves. The lab data served as reference data to classify home movement quality using dynamic time warping. Incorrect and correct movement quality was labeled by a therapist. The home task practice movement quality was classified with an accuracy of 92% and F1 score of 0.95 for all tasks combined. Movement types contributing to misclassification were further investigated. The results support the feasibility of a home movement quality monitoring system to assist with upper limb rehabilitation post stroke. © 2024 by the authors."

However, integrating a conventional high-temperature chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-grown TMD with a flexible substrate necessitates a transfer process that inevitably degrades the sensing properties of the TMDs and increases the overall fabrication complexity. We present a high-performance piezoresistive strain sensor that employs large-area PdSe2 films grown directly on polyimide (PI) substrates via plasma-assisted selenization of a sputtered Pd film. The reliable strain transfer from the substrate to the PdSe2 film ensures an outstanding strain-sensing capability of the sensor. Specifically, the sensors have a gauge factor of up to −315 ± 2.1, a response time under 25 ms, a detection limit of 8 × 10−6, and an exceptional stability of over 104 loading–unloading cycles. By attaching the sensors to the skin surface, we demonstrate their application for measuring physiological parameters in health care monitoring, including motion, voice, and arterial pulse vibration. Furthermore, using the PdSe2 film sensor combined with deep learning technology, we achieved intelligent recognition of artery temperature from arterial pulse signals with only a 2% difference between predicted and actual temperatures. The excellent sensing performance, together with the advantages of low-temperature fabrication and simple device structure, make the PdSe2 film sensor promising for wearable electronics and health care sensing systems.

Physiological sensor data (e.g. photoplethysmograph) is important for remotely monitoring patients’ vital signals, but is often affected by measurement noise. Existing feature-based models for signal cleaning can be limited as they might not capture the full signal characteristics. Approach. In this work we present a deep learning framework for sensor signal cleaning based on dilated convolutions which capture the coarse- and fine-grained structure in order to classify whether a signal is noisy or clean. However, since obtaining annotated physiological data is costly and time-consuming we propose an autoencoder-based semi-supervised model which is able to learn a representation of the sensor signal characteristics, also adding an element of interpretability. Main results. Our proposed models are over 8% more accurate than existing feature-based approaches with half the false positive/negative rates. Finally, we show that with careful tuning (that can be improved further), the semi-supervised model outperforms supervised approaches suggesting that incorporating the large amounts of available unlabeled data can be advantageous for achieving high accuracy (over 90%) and minimizing the false positive/negative rates.

Early diagnosis and treatment of SCC are essential to improve outcomes. Here we report a deep learning model-derived SCC-Score to detect and predict SCC from time-series data recorded continuously by a medical wearable. In this single-arm, single-center, observational cohort study, vital signs and physical activity were recorded with a wearable for 31,234 h in 79 patients (54 Inpatient Cohort (IC)/25 Outpatient Cohort (OC)). Hours with normal physical functioning without evidence of SCC (regular hours) were presented to a deep neural network that was trained by a self-supervised contrastive learning objective to extract features from the time series that are typical in regular periods. The model was used to calculate a SCC-Score that measures the dissimilarity to regular features. Detection and prediction performance of the SCC-Score was compared to clinical documentation of SCC (AUROC ± SD). In total 124 clinically documented SCC occurred in the IC, 16 in the OC. Detection of SCC was achieved in the IC with a sensitivity of 79.7% and specificity of 87.9%, with AUROC of 0.91 ± 0.01 (OC sensitivity 77.4%, specificity 81.8%, AUROC 0.87 ± 0.02). Prediction of infectious SCC was possible up to 2 days before clinical diagnosis (AUROC 0.90 at −24 h and 0.88 at −48 h). We provide proof of principle for the detection and prediction of SCC in patients treated for hematological malignancies using wearable data and a deep learning model. As a consequence, remote patient monitoring may enable pre-emptive complication management. © 2023, The Author(s)."

The effective control of mean arterial pressure (MAP) in a closed-loop manner is particularly critical for individuals who are critically ill or in the process of recovering from surgical procedures. Within the framework of the present research, an adaptive closed-loop structure has been formulated with the objective of controlling a patient's MAP through governed administration of the medication sodium nitroprusside (SNP), to attain the desired MAP levels under varying conditions. The proposed closed-loop technique incorporates an intelligent controller known as the active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) with the intention of tracking the desired MAP value, alongside the utilization of continuous action policy gradient (CAPG) for the optimization of the controller's coefficients. Under the DRL strategy, an actor is responsible for generating policy requests, while a critic assesses the efficacy of the actor's policy directives. This approach uses gradient descent to train the weight values of both actor and critic networks, and it is dependent on the reward return linked to the MAP fault.

This technique leverages IoT devices, namely connected health monitors and wearable sensors, to continuously gather electrocardiogram (ECG) information from individuals. This information, streamed in real-time, provides a great opportunity for timely and remote monitoring of cardiac health. Leveraging the abilities of deep learning and IoT, this technique provides an automated and more sophisticated means of classifying and detecting arrhythmias, improving the efficiency and accuracy of diagnoses. This article presents an Internet of Things Enabled Based Arrhythmia Classification using the Dandelion Optimization Algorithm with Ensemble Learning (AC-DOAEL) method. The presented AC-DOAEL technique utilizes IoT-based data collection with an ensemble learning-based classification process. For the arrhythmia detection and classification process, the AC-DOAEL technique follows an ensemble learning algorithm such as long short-term memory (LSTM), autoencoder (AE), and bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) models. To improve the recognition rate of the ensemble models, the AC-DOAEL technique uses DOA as a hyperparameter optimizer.

It provides great convenience and enables timely medical decisions. To facilitate the decision making for each patient, a model is needed to translate the data collected by the patient's smartphone into a predicted score for his/her disease severity. To train a robust predictive model, semi-supervised learning (SSL) provides a viable approach by integrating both labeled and unlabeled samples to leverage all the available data from each patient. There are two challenging issues that need to be simultaneously addressed in using SSL for this problem: (1) feature selection from high-dimensional noisy telemonitoring data; and (2) instance selection from many, possibly redundant unlabeled samples. We propose a novel SSL model allowing for simultaneous feature and instance selection, namely the S2SSL model. We present a real-data application of telemonitoring for patients with Parkinson's Disease using their smartphone-collected activity data such as tapping and speaking. A total of 382 features were extracted from the activity data of each patient. 74 labeled and 563 unlabeled instances from 37 patients were used to train S2SSL. The trained model achieved a high accuracy of 0.828 correlation between the true and predicted disease severity scores on a validation dataset. Note to Practitioners - Telemonitoring is an emerging health care platform enabled by smartphones and wearables. Because it allows for health data to be collected anytime and anywhere, patients can be frequently monitored and medical decisions can be made more timely and effectively. This paper addresses the data science challenges in leveraging the telemonitoring platform to benefit patient care. Specifically, we propose a new model, S2SSL, to tackle these challenges and provide better robustness, accuracy, and efficiency. This paper may be interesting to health care practitioners seeking advanced analytics capabilities to model and integrate the data collected through telemonitoring devices, with ultimate purposes of improving the decision in treating each patient and increasing patient access to specialized care.  © 2004-2012 IEEE."

In this clinical trial, we randomly assigned 500 patients discharged from hospital to home to use either a smartphone or wearable device to collect and transmit remote patient monitoring (RPM) data on activity patterns after hospital discharge. Analyses were conducted at the patient-day level using discrete-time survival analysis. Each arm was split into training and testing folds. The training set used fivefold cross-validation and then final model results are from predictions on the test set. A standard model comprised data collected up to the time of discharge including demographics, comorbidities, hospital length of stay, and vitals prior to discharge. An enhanced model consisted of the standard model plus RPM data. Traditional parametric regression models (logit and lasso) were compared to nonparametric machine learning approaches (random forest, gradient boosting, and ensemble). The main outcome was hospital readmission or death within 30 days of discharge. Prediction of 30-day hospital readmission significantly improved when including remotely-monitored patient data on activity patterns after hospital discharge and using nonparametric machine learning approaches.

A trial design may vary anywhere from fully decentralized to hybrid to traditional on-site. Various decentralization components are available for stakeholders to increase the reach and pace of their trials, such as electronic informed consent, remote interviews, administration, outcome assessment, monitoring, and laboratory and imaging modalities. Furthermore, digital health technologies can be included to enrich study conduct. However, careful consideration is warranted, including assessing verification and validity through usability studies and having various contingencies in place through dedicated risk assessment.

Unattended stress is a silent killer and may lead to fatal physical and mental disorders if left unidentified. Stress identification based on individual judgement often leads to under-diagnosis and delayed treatment possibilities. EEG-based stress monitoring is quite popular in this context, but impractical to use for continuous remote monitoring.Continuous remote monitoring of stress using signals acquired from everyday wearables like smart watches is the best alternative here. Non-EEG data such as heart rate and ectodermal activity can also act as indicators of physiological stress. In this work, we have explored the possibility of using nonlinear features from non-EEG data such as (a) heart rate, (b) ectodermal activity, (c) body temperature (d) SpO2 and (e) acceleration in detecting four different types of neurological states; namely (1) Relaxed state, (2) State of Physical stress, (3) State of Cognitive stress and (4) State of Emotional stress. Physiological data of 20 healthy adults have been used from the noneeg database of PhysioNet.Results: We used two machine learning models; a linear logistic regression and a nonlinear random forest to detect (a) stress from relaxed state and (4) the four different neurological states. We trained the models using linear and nonlinear features separately. For the 2-class and 4-class problems, using nonlinear features increased the accuracy of the models.

Methods: We recruited 21 participants with PSP(n = 11) or PD(n = 10) with reliable caregivers. Standardized passage reading, counting, and sustained phonation were recorded on the BioDigit Home tablet (BioSensics LLC, Newton, MA USA), and speech features from the assessments were analyzed using the BioDigit Speech platform (BioSensics LLC, Newton, MA USA). An independent t-test was performed to compare each speech feature between PSP and PD participants. We also performed Spearman's correlations to evaluate associations between speech measures and clinical scores (e.g., PSP rating scales and MoCA). In addition, the model's performance in classifying PSP and PD was evaluated using Rainbow passage reading analysis. Results: During Rainbow passage reading, PSP participants had a significantly slower articulation rate (2.45(0.49) vs 3.60(0.47) words/minute), lower speech-to-pause ratio (2.33(1.08) vs 3.67(1.18)), intelligibility dynamic time warping (DTW, 0.26(0.19) vs 0.53(0.26)), and similarity DTW (0.43(0.27) vs 0.67(0.13)) compared to PD participants.

In terms of the phonation ‘a’, PSP participants showed a significant higher spectral entropy, spectral centroid, and spectral spread compared to PD participants and no differences were found for phonation ‘e’. PD participants had more accurate reverse number counts than PSP participants (14.89(3.86) vs 7.36(4.67)). PSP Rating Scale (PSPRS) dysarthria (r = 0.79, p = 0.004) and bulbar item scores (r = 0.803, p = 0.005) were positively correlated with articulation rate in reverse number counts. Correct reverse number counts were positively correlated with total Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores (r = 0.703, p = 0.016). Machine learning models using passage reading-derived measures obtained an AUC of 0.93, and the sensitivity/specificity in correctly classifying PSP and PD participants were 0.95 and 0.90, respectively.

This paper proposes a framework for heart sound detection that can be considered for deployment on smart wearable devices to screen CVDs conveniently. A dual-stream convolutional neural network (DS-CNN) is developed to detect abnormal ones from short-term heart sound recordings. Preprocessing module is first employed for noise filtering and amplitude normalization. Then short-time Fourier transform and higher-order spectral are introduced for feature extraction, whose products are subsequently fed into the DS-CNN for screening abnormal heart sound signals. Two open accessible datasets are employed for performance evaluation. The results well demonstrate the classification accuracy of the proposed DS-CNN, and also indicate its advantages for adapting to heart sound recordings collected by different equipments.  © 1975-2011 IEEE."

In this research, we present a machine learning (ML)-based remote monitoring method to estimate patient recovery from COVID-19 symptoms using automatically collected wearable device data, instead of relying on manually collected symptom data. We deploy our remote monitoring system, namely eCOVID, in two COVID-19 telemedicine clinics. Our system utilizes a Garmin wearable and symptom tracker mobile app for data collection. The data consists of vitals, lifestyle, and symptom information which is fused into an online report for clinicians to review. Symptom data collected via our mobile app is used to label the recovery status of each patient daily. We propose a ML-based binary patient recovery classifier which uses wearable data to estimate whether a patient has recovered from COVID-19 symptoms. We evaluate our method using leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation, and find that Random Forest (RF) is the top performing model. Our method achieves an F1-score of 0.88 when applying our RF-based model personalization technique using weighted bootstrap aggregation.

However, their non-linearity and tardy response time severely influence their sensing precision, and their low toughness, inferior environmental adaptation and non-recyclability are bad for their durability and unfavorable for electronic waste management. Here, we designed and synthesized a wide linear range and fast response strain sensor based on ionic conductive hydrogels (PVA-CS-PA hydrogels) using biodegradable polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and chitosan (CS) as the polymer backbone, and biogenic phytic acid (PA) as the crosslinker. PVA-CS-PA hydrogels are tough and ductile. The hydrogel with a volume ratio of 3 : 2 for PA : H2O (PVA-CS-3PA-2 hydrogel), had a stretchability of 915 ± 32.44%, strength of 6.02 ± 0.18 MPa, and fracture energy of 5.28 ± 0.24 kJ m−2. It was also thermoplastic and anti-drying (more than 90% water retention after 30 days). The hydrogel-based strain sensor displayed a wide linear working range up to 900% strain, a fast response time within 50 ms, and reliable stability to detect subtle and large motions. Moreover, its sensing performance is maintained well after a thermoplastic process and long-term storage, suggesting it has reusability and a long lifetime. This tough, wide linear range, fast response, green, and recyclable hydrogel-based strain sensor is expected to pave the way for the development of environmentally friendly and high-performance artificial intelligence in versatile electronic applications. © 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry."

Disease prediction is one of the emerging applications in current practices. In the method described in this paper, lung cancer prediction is implemented using deep learning and IoT, which is a challenging task in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). Because lung cancer is a dangerous medical disease that must be identified at a higher detection rate, disease-related information is obtained from IoT medical devices and transmitted to the server. The medical data are then processed and classified into two categories, benign and malignant, using a multi-layer CNN (ML-CNN) model. In addition, a particle swarm optimization method is used to improve the learning ability (loss and accuracy). This step uses medical data (CT scan and sensor information) based on the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). For this purpose, sensor information and image information from IoMT devices and sensors are gathered, and then classification actions are taken. The performance of the proposed technique is compared with well-known existing methods, such as the Support Vector Machine (SVM), probabilistic neural network (PNN), and conventional CNN, in terms of accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, F-score, and computation time. For this purpose, two lung datasets were tested to evaluate the performance: Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC) and Linear Imaging and Self-Scanning Sensor (LISS) datasets. Compared to alternative methods, the trial outcomes showed that the suggested technique has the potential to help the radiologist make an accurate and efficient early lung cancer diagnosis. The performance of the proposed ML-CNN was analyzed using Python, where the accuracy (2.5–10.5%) was high when compared to the number of instances, precision (2.3–9.5%) was high when compared to the number of instances, sensitivity (2.4–12.5%) was high when compared to several instances, the F-score (2–30%) was high when compared to the number of cases, the error rate (0.7–11.5%) was low compared to the number of cases, and the computation time (170 ms to 400 ms) was low compared to how many cases were computed for the proposed work, including previous known methods.

The wireless monitoring system monitors patients’ medical metrics and communicates them to the furthest edge via the ZigBee gateway. This paper introduces an IoT-enabled smart e-healthcare system that can continuously monitor patients' vital signs and the real-time room environment where patients are currently positioned.

For each situation, the percentage of errors in the developed scheme is less than 2%. The patient's situation is relayed to medical personnel via a portal, where they can monitor, process, and analyze the patient's real-time situation. A low-power communication device and an embedded smart IoT system are being designed and developed with the goal of covertly gathering physiological metrics without interfering with daily life. Sensor-based data analytics using machine learning methods were used in this study to identify predictors and/or sudden abnormality indicators accurately.

However, there has been a considerable challenge to successfully fabricate them with a tradeoff between high sensitivity and wide sensing range by low-cost and convenient manufacturing methods. Herein, the orientated thermoplastic polyurethane elastomer rubber nanofiber membranes (TPU-O NMs) were prepared via conjugated electrospinning to build a dielectric layer for the flexible capacitive wide-range pressure sensors with high sensitivity. In addition, polyaniline (PANI) was in situ polymerized on the TPU-O NMs as flexible electrodes to maintain the conductive pathway, flexibility, and breathability of the sensors. The TPU@PANI NMs form a bamboo-raft-like microstructure between the aligned fibers under pressure, resulting in a significant increase in sensitivity and working range. Furthermore, the conductive TPU@PANI NMs can be stretched to 1600% without fracture. The assembled sensor has a high sensitivity of 31.73 kPa−1 and a fast response/recovery time of 96 ms. Meantime, it also exhibits a minimum detection limit of 1 Pa, an excellent stability of 10,000 cycles, and a good linearity in a broad working age (1 Pa∼122.5 kPa).

This study presents a novel contact-free visual-based pipeline for ET assessment that integrates refined whole-body pose estimation with Transformer-based tremor detection to quantify tremor severity at a fine-grained level. The proposed pose estimation method combines the Transformer with HRNet, effectively capturing spatial-temporal complementary information from multiple body parts and enabling highly accurate tremor detection. The Transformer-based tremor detection is well-suited for modeling long-range dependencies and sequential tremor data extracted by the pose estimation model, further improving the performance of our proposed method. Our study collected data from 61 patients with ET, achieving an average accuracy, recall, and F1 score of 95.6%/95.6%, 89.2%/95.0%, and 83.0%/92.4% for classifying ET severity both during rest and postural tasks, respectively. Our proposed method outperforms the temporal convolutional network baseline, increasing F1 scores by 21.17% and 14.22% for rest and postural tasks, respectively. This high level of accuracy makes our method highly useful for clinical applications such as remote monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment evaluation. Our proposed technique has many advantages over traditional ET assessment techniques, including non-invasiveness, contact-free operation, and not requiring any wearable sensors or visual markers.

We categorised 56% of studies as ‘Treatment-Manual’, i.e. studies involving technologies aimed at treatment requiring manual data generation, and 26% as ‘Prevention-Autonomous’, i.e. studies of technologies generating data autonomously through wearable sensors aimed at ulcer prevention through patient behavioural change. Only 10% of studies involved more ambitious ‘Treatment-Autonomous’ interventions. We found that studies generally reported high levels of patient adherence and satisfaction. Conclusions: Our findings point to a major potential role for DHTs in remote personalised medical management of DFUs. However, larger studies are required to assess their impact. Here, we see opportunities for developing much larger, more comprehensive, and integrated monitoring and decision support systems with the potential to address the disease in a more complete context by capturing and integrating data from multiple sources from subjective and objective measurements.

Continuous remote monitoring of physiological parameters and symptom changes offers the potential for timely intervention, improved patient outcomes, and reduced health care costs. Objective: This study investigated whether a real-time multimodal program using commercially available wearable technology, home-based Bluetooth-enabled spirometers, finger pulse oximeters, and smartphone apps is feasible and acceptable for patients with chronic respiratory diseases, as well as the value of low-burden, long-term passive data collection. Methods: In a 3-arm prospective observational cohort feasibility study, we recruited 60 patients from the Royal Free Hospital and University College Hospital. These patients had been diagnosed with interstitial lung disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or post–COVID-19 condition (n=20 per group) and were followed for 180 days. This study used a comprehensive remote monitoring system designed to provide real-time and relevant data for both patients and clinicians. Data were collected using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture; Vanderbilt University) periodic surveys, Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapses–base active app questionnaires, wearables, finger pulse oximeters, smartphone apps, and Bluetooth home-based spirometry. The feasibility of remote monitoring was measured through adherence to the protocol, engagement during the follow-up period, retention rate, acceptability, and data integrity. Results: Lowest-burden passive data collection methods, via wearables, demonstrated superior adherence, engagement, and retention compared with active data collection methods, with an average wearable use of 18.66 (SD 4.69) hours daily (77.8% of the day), 123.91 (SD 33.73) hours weekly (72.6% of the week), and 463.82 (SD 156.70) hours monthly (64.4% of the month). Highest-burden spirometry tasks and high-burden active app tasks had the lowest adherence, engagement, and retention, followed by low-burden questionnaires. Spirometry and active questionnaires had the lowest retention at 0.5 survival probability, indicating that they were the most burdensome. Adherence to and quality of home spirometry were analyzed; of the 7200 sessions requested, 4248 (59%) were performed. Of these, 90.3% (3836/4248) were of acceptable quality according to American Thoracic Society grading. Inclusion of protocol holidays improved retention measures. The technologies used were generally well received. Conclusions: Our findings provide evidence supporting the feasibility and acceptability of remote monitoring for capturing both subjective and objective data from various sources for respiratory diseases. The high engagement level observed with passively collected data suggests the potential of wearables for long-term, user-friendly remote monitoring in respiratory disease management. The unique piloting of certain features such as protocol holidays, alert notifications for missing data, and flexible support from the study team provides a reference for future studies in this field. © Malik A Althobiani, Yatharth Ranjan, Joseph Jacob, Michele Orini, Richard James Butler Dobson, Joanna C Porter, John R Hurst, Amos A Folarin."

Models include technology such as machine learning and smart wearables, that can be used to integrate patient data and improve continuity of care. This model may have benefits in situations where patient deterioration must be detected quickly so that a rapid response can occur such as cardiopulmonary settings. Aim: The purpose of this scoping review was to examine the evidence for a digital hospital model of care, in the context of cardiac and pulmonary settings. Design: Scoping review. Data sources: Databases searched were using PsycInfo, Ovid MEDLINE, and CINAHL. Studies written in English and containing key terms related to digital hospital and cardiopulmonary care were included. The Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for systematic reviews was used to assess the risk of bias. Results: Thirteen (13) studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. For cardiac conditions, a deep-learning-based rapid response system warning system for predicting patient deterioration leading to cardiac arrest had up to 257% higher sensitivity than conventional methods. There was also a reduction in the number of patients who needed to be examined by a physician. Using continuous telemonitoring with a wireless real-time electrocardiogram compared with non-monitoring, there was improved initial resuscitation and 24-hour post-event survival for high-risk patients. However, there were no benefits for survival to discharge. For pulmonary conditions, a natural language processing algorithm reduced the time to asthma diagnosis, demonstrating high predictive values. Virtual inhaler education was found to be as effective as in-person education, and prescription error was reduced following the implementation of computer-based physician order entry electronic medical records and a clinical decision support tool. Conclusions: While we currently have only a brief glimpse at the impact of technology care delivery for cardiac and respiratory conditions, technology presents an opportunity to improve quality and safety in care, but only with the support of adequate infrastructure and processes.

The steady progress of IHD leads to an irreversible condition called myocardial infarction (MI). The detection of MI can be done by observing the altered electrocardiogram (ECG) characteristics. Often, automated ECG analysis is preferred in place of visual inspection to reduce time and ensure reliable detection even when the recording quality is not very good. This paper presents an automated approach to classify recent MI, past MI, and normal sinus rhythm (NSR) classes based on the morphological features of the ECG. In clinical practice, a standard 12-lead ECG setup is typically employed to identify MI. However, acquiring a 12-lead ECG is not always convenient. Hence, in this study, we have explored the possibility of using a minimal number of ECG leads by deriving the augmented limb leads using leads I and II. A well-known and widely used ensemble machine learning tool, the random forest (RF) classifier is trained using features extracted from the derived augmented limb leads and their combinations. An RF classifier built using features extracted from all limb leads has outperformed classifiers built on combinations of them with five-fold cross-validation training accuracy of 97.9 (±0.008) % and testing accuracy of 98 %.Clinical relevance-As high sensitivity is reported in identifying recent MI and past MI classes, the proposed approach is suitable for preventative healthcare applications since it is less likely that subjects with recent or past MI will be misclassified. Due to its low computational complexity, better interpretability, and comparable performance to the state-of-the-art results, the proposed approach can be employed in clinical and cardiac health screening applications. It also has the potential to be employed in remote monitoring with mobile and wearable devices because it is built on features extracted from only lead I and II ECG recordings. © 2023 IEEE."

The increasing need for these automated systems has led to the emergence of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) networks. In the IoMT networks, the biosensor devices collect vital signs and transmit them to the gateway for further analysis and fusion. In light of the limited biosensor device resources (power, storage, and computation) and the periodical transmission of a large amount of data, it is necessary to optimize the transmission of data in order to conserve power while maintaining data quality at the gateway. Also, it became important to have a decision-making-based machine learning model at the gateway to evaluate a patient's health and make a quick, accurate decision in case of an emergency. This article proposes multibiosensor data sampling and transmission reduction with decision-making (MuDaSaTReD) for remote patient monitoring in the IoMT networks. The MuDaSaTReD achieves this goal on two levels: biosensors and a fog gateway. It uses an energy-saving lightweight data transmission (ELiDaT) algorithm to get rid of the repeated data and then adapts the sampling rate of each biosensor using an adaptive data sampling (ADaS) algorithm. The Multibiosensor Data Sampling and Transmission Reduction with Decision-making (MuDaFuDeC) implements the machine learning model at the fog gateway to learn and decide the situation of the patient according to the received data from the biosensors.

As ubiquitous computing applications, human activity recognition and localization have also been popularly worked on. These applications are used in healthcare monitoring, behavior analysis, personal safety, and entertainment. A robust model has been proposed in this article that works over IoT data extracted from smartphone and smartwatch sensors to recognize the activities performed by the user and, in the meantime, classify the location at which the human performed that particular activity. The system starts by denoising the input signal using a second-order Butterworth filter and then uses a hamming window to divide the signal into small data chunks. Multiple stacked windows are generated using three windows per stack, which, in turn, prove helpful in producing more reliable features. The stacked data are then transferred to two parallel feature extraction blocks, i.e., human activity recognition and human localization. The respective features are extracted for both modules that reinforce the system’s accuracy. A recursive feature elimination is applied to the features of both categories independently to select the most informative ones among them. After the feature selection, a genetic algorithm is used to generate ten different generations of each feature vector for data augmentation purposes, which directly impacts the system’s performance. Finally, a deep neural decision forest is trained for classifying the activity and the subject’s location while working on both of these attributes in parallel.

Therefore, early fall detection, followed by reliable and timely notification, is vital to ensure the survival of firefighters. However, due to complex and diverse firefighting scenarios, current fall detection systems (FDSs) are inadequate, especially in terms of accuracy and real-time applications. Hence, in this study, a wearable pre-impact FDS (PIFDS) for firefighters is proposed. We also evaluated the feasibility of using machine learning (ML) and ensemble learning (EL) methods deployed on the edge node to simultaneously improve the real-time performance and accuracy. Moving thresholding method is introduced to overcome the class-imbalanced issue due to fewer samples acquired during the pre-impact (PI) phase. Based on 14 firefighters' data collection, the experimental results revealed that a Decision Tree classifier with optimized parameters (DT-ED4) outperformed other ML and EL methods in a tradeoff between processing time and accuracy. The results also showed that our system can detect falls before the impact with an average lead time of 447.9 ms, sensitivity of 95.10%, and specificity of 97.99%. The system's heterogeneous IoT network architecture facilitated remote monitoring and alerts that enabled the incident commander (IC) to execute the rescue mission immediately upon notification.

Its significance is pronounced in diverse fields, especially healthcare, where it finds applications in scenarios such as medical service tracking. By analyzing patterns in observed parameters, the anticipation of disease types becomes feasible. Stress monitoring with wearable sensors and the Internet of Things (IoT) is a potential application that can enhance wellness and preventative health management. Healthcare professionals have harnessed robust systems incorporating battery-based wearable technology and wireless communication channels to enable cost-effective healthcare monitoring for various medical conditions. Network-connected sensors, whether within living spaces or worn on the body, accumulate data crucial for evaluating patients' health. The integration of machine learning and cutting-edge technology has sparked research interest in addressing stress levels. Psychological stress significantly impacts a person's physiological parameters. Stress can have negative impacts over time, prompting sometimes costly therapies. Acute stress levels can even constitute a life-threatening risk, especially in people who have previously been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder or schizophrenia. To offer a proactive solution within the realm of smart healthcare, this article introduces a novel machine learning-based system termed ""Stress-Track"".

Despite the documented benefits of CR programs, the participation remains suboptimal. Home-based CR programs have been proposed to improve uptake and adherence. The goal of this study was to apply an end-to-end methodology including machine learning techniques to predict the 6-month adherence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) patients to a home-based telemonitoring CR program, combining patients’ clinical information with their actual program participation during a short familiarization phase. Fifty CVD patients participated in such a program for 6 months, enabling personalized guidance during a phase III CR study. Clinical, fitness, and psychological data were measured at baseline, whereas actual adherence, in terms of weekly exercise session duration and patient heart rate, was measured using wearables. Hierarchical clustering was used to identify different groups based on (1) patients’ clinical baseline characteristics, (2) exercise adherence during the familiarization phase, and (3) the whole program adherence, whereas the output of the clustering was determined using repetitive decision trees (DTs) and random forest (RF) techniques to predict long-term adherence. Finally, for each cluster of patients, network analysis was applied to discover correlations of their characteristics that link to adherence. Based on baseline characteristics, patients were clustered into three groups, with differences in behavior and risk factors, whereas adherent, non-adherent, and transient adherent patients were identified during the familiarization phase. Regarding the prediction of long-term adherence, the most common DT showed higher performance compared with RF (precision: 80.2 ± 19.5% and 71.8 ± 25.8%, recall: 94.5 ± 14.5% and 71.8 ± 25.8% for DT and RF accordingly). The analysis of the DT rules and the analysis of the feature importance of the RF model highlighted the significance of non-adherence during the familiarization phase, as well as that of the baseline characteristics to predict future adherence. Network analysis revealed different relationships in different clusters of patients and the interplay between their behavioral characteristics. In conclusion, the main novelty of this study is the application of machine learning techniques combining patient characteristics before the start of the home-based CR programs with data during a short familiarization phase, which can predict long-term adherence with high accuracy. The data used in this study are available through connected health technologies and standard measurements in CR; thus, the proposed methodology can be generalized to other telerehabilitation programs and help healthcare providers to improve patient-tailored enrolment strategies and resource allocation. © 2023 by the authors."

This raises a pertinent question: which devices and parameters perform best in exacerbation detection? METHODS A total of 149 patients with asthma (90 children, 59 adults) participated in a 6-month observational study. Participants (or parents) regularly (daily for the first 2 weeks and weekly for the next 5.5 months, with increased frequency during exacerbations) performed self-examinations using 3 devices: an artificial intelligence (AI)-aided home stethoscope (providing wheezes, rhonchi, and coarse and fine crackles intensity; respiratory and heart rate; and inspiration-to-expiration ratio), a peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) meter, and a peak expiratory flow (PEF) meter and filled out a health state survey. The resulting 6,029 examinations were evaluated by physicians for the presence of exacerbations. For each registered parameter, a machine learning model was trained, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated to assess its utility in exacerbation detection. RESULTS The best single-parameter discriminators of exacerbations were wheezes intensity for young children (AUC 84% [95% CI, 82%-85%]), rhonchi intensity for older children (AUC 81% [95% CI, 79%-84%]), and survey answers for adults (AUC 92% [95% CI, 89%-95%]). The greatest efficacy (in terms of AUC) was observed for a combination of several parameters. CONCLUSIONS The AI-aided home stethoscope provides reliable information on asthma exacerbations. The parameters provided are effective for children, especially those younger than 5 years of age. The introduction of this tool to the health care system might enhance asthma exacerbation detection substantially and make remote monitoring of patients easier. © 2023, Annals of Family Medicine, Inc.

However, the total average recognition rate of the nine sports is 0.971, which is already above 0.96, which proves that the average recognition rate of the monitoring system is above 96%. The system is considered to be a basic design success. It is basically realized that starting from the wearable heart rate monitoring, a machine learning sensor that can be put into large-scale application is designed. © This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited."

Adopting artificial-intelligence- (AI)-based techniques for patient treatment has brought a dramatic revolution into the modern smart healthcare system (SHS). Modern healthcare is leveraging the internet of medical things (IoMT) network comprised of wireless body sensor devices (WBSDs) and implantable medical devices (IMDs) to reduce treatment latency and cost drastically. However, the open network communication of the less secured IoMT devices and increasing growth of adversarial capability give rise to several vulnerabilities, which need to be taken into consideration while designing SHS. We propose a novel and comprehensive framework with machine learning (ML) and formal analysis capability to build a secure and attack-resilient SHS. Our framework uses a novel ensemble of unsupervised ML-based patient status classification and anomaly detection models with bio-inspired computing (BIC)-based ML models’ hyperparameter optimization techniques. The proposed anomaly detection model (ADM) can detect zero-day attacks and uses a novel fitness function calculation technique for BIC-based SHS ADM’s hyperparameter optimization. Moreover, the framework leverages novel formal attack analytics to assess the robustness of the underlying classification and abnormality detection models.

Here, we report a dry epidermal patch made from a supramolecular polymer (SESA) and an in situ transferred carbon nanotubes' percolation network. The polymer possesses a hybrid structure of copolymerized permanent scaffold permeated by multiple dynamic interactions, which imparts a desired mechanical response transition from elastic recoil to energy dissipation with increased elongation. Such SESA-based patches are soft (Young's modulus ∼0.1 MPa) and elastic within physiologically relevant strain levels (97% elastic recovery at 50% tensile strain), intrinsically mechanical-electrical damage-resilient (∼90% restoration from damage after 5 min), and interference-immune in dynamic signal acquisition (stretch, underwater, sweat).

Its slow and variable progression makes the development of new treatments highly dependent on validated biomarkers that can quantify disease progression and response to drug interventions. Objective: We aimed to build a tool that estimates FSHD clinical severity based on behavioral features captured using smartphone and remote sensor data. The adoption of remote monitoring tools, such as smartphones and wearables, would provide a novel opportunity for continuous, passive, and objective monitoring of FSHD symptom severity outside the clinic. Methods: In total, 38 genetically confirmed patients with FSHD were enrolled. The FSHD Clinical Score and the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test were used to assess FSHD symptom severity at days 0 and 42. Remote sensor data were collected using an Android smartphone, Withings Steel HR+, Body+, and BPM Connect+ for 6 continuous weeks. We created 2 single-task regression models that estimated the FSHD Clinical Score and TUG separately. Further, we built 1 multitask regression model that estimated the 2 clinical assessments simultaneously. Further, we assessed how an increasingly incremental time window affected the model performance. To do so, we trained the models on an incrementally increasing time window (from day 1 until day 14) and evaluated the predictions of the clinical severity on the remaining 4 weeks of data. Results: The single-task regression models achieved an R2 of 0.57 and 0.59 and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 2.09 and 1.66 when estimating FSHD Clinical Score and TUG, respectively. Time spent at a health-related location (such as a gym or hospital) and call duration were features that were predictive of both clinical assessments. The multitask model achieved an R2 of 0.66 and 0.81 and an RMSE of 1.97 and 1.61 for the FSHD Clinical Score and TUG, respectively, and therefore outperformed the single-task models in estimating clinical severity. The 3 most important features selected by the multitask model were light sleep duration, total steps per day, and mean steps per minute. Using an increasing time window (starting from day 1 to day 14) for the FSHD Clinical Score, TUG, and multitask estimation yielded an average R2 of 0.65, 0.79, and 0.76 and an average RMSE of 3.37, 2.05, and 4.37, respectively. Conclusions: We demonstrated that smartphone and remote sensor data could be used to estimate FSHD clinical severity and therefore complement the assessment of FSHD outside the clinic. In addition, our results illustrated that training the models on the first week of data allows for consistent and stable prediction of FSHD symptom severity. Longitudinal follow-up studies should be conducted to further validate the reliability and validity of the multitask model as a tool to monitor disease progression over a longer period. © Ahnjili Zhuparris, Ghobad Maleki, Ingrid Koopmans, Robert J Doll, Nicoline Voet, Wessel Kraaij, Adam Cohen, Emilie van Brummelen, Joris H De Maeyer, Geert Jan Groeneveld."

Although presenting higher prevalence rates than the general population, it is often not reported or remains unnoticed. Moreover, somatic symptoms of depression are common in the oncological context and should not be dismissed as a general symptom of cancer. It becomes even more challenging to track psychological distress in the period after the treatment, where connection with the healthcare system typically becomes sporadic. The main goal of the FAITH project is to remotely identify and predict depressive symptoms in cancer survivors, based on a federated machine learning (ML) approach, towards optimization of privacy. Methods: FAITH will remotely analyse depression markers, predicting their negative trends. These markers will be treated in distinct categories, namely nutrition, sleep, activity and voice, assessed in part through wearable technologies. The study will include 300 patients who have had a previous diagnosis of breast or lung cancer and will be recruited 1 to 5 years after the end of primary cancer. The study will be organized as a 12-month longitudinal prospective observational cohort study, with monthly assessments to evaluate depression symptoms and quality of life among cancer survivors. The primary endpoint is the severity of depressive symptoms as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (Ham-D) at months 3, 6, 9 and 12. Secondary outcomes include self-reported anxiety and depression symptoms (HADS scale), and perceived quality of life (EORTC questionnaires), at baseline and monthly.

In total, 3 researchers independently and collaboratively assessed the eligibility of the retrieved articles and elicited the relevant data and findings using tables and charts. Results: This review synthesized 20 articles that met the inclusion criteria, 70% (14/20) of which were conducted between 2018 and 2020. Three-quarters of the studies (15/20, 75%) were conducted in Western countries, with the United States accounting for 25% (5/20). Activities of daily living were the most studied (9/20, 45%), followed by physical activity (6/20, 30%), therapeutic exercise (4/20, 20%), and bodyweight exercise (1/20, 5%). K-nearest neighbor and naïve Bayes classifier were the most used machine learning algorithms for activity recognition, with at least 10% (2/20) of the studies using either algorithm. Ambient and wearable technologies were equally studied (8/20, 40% each), followed by robots (3/20, 15%). Activity recognition was the most common goal of the evaluated smart home technologies, with 55% (11/20) of the studies reporting it, followed by activity monitoring (7/20, 35%). Most studies (8/20, 40%) were conducted in a laboratory setting. Moreover, 25% (5/20) and 10% (2/20) were conducted in a home and hospital setting, respectively. Finally, 75% (15/20) had a positive outcome, 15% (3/20) had a mixed outcome, and 10% (2/20) had an indeterminate outcome. Conclusions: Our results suggest that smart home technologies, especially digital personal assistants, coaches, and robots, are effective in promoting physical activity among the young population. Although only few studies were identified among the older population, smart home technologies hold bright prospects in assisting and aiding older people to age in place and function independently, especially in Western countries, where there are shortages of long-term care workers. Hence, there is a need to do more work (eg, cross-cultural studies and randomized controlled trials) among the growing aging population on the effectiveness and acceptance of smart home technologies that aim to promote physical activity. © Kiemute Oyibo, Kang Wang, Plinio Pelegrini Morita."

Exacerbations of COPD (ECOPDs) are a leading cause of acute hospitalization among all adult chronic diseases. There is currently a paradigm shift in the way that ECOPDs are conceptualized. For the first time, objective physiological parameters are being used to define/classify what an ECOPD is (including heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation criteria) and therefore a mechanism to monitor and measure their changes, particularly in an outpatient ambulatory setting, are now of great value. In addition to pre-existing challenges on traditional ‘in-person’ health models such as geography and seasonal (ex. winter) impacts on the ability to deliver in-person visit-based care, the COVID-19 pandemic imposed additional stressors including lockdowns, social distancing, and the closure of pulmonary function labs.

Its specific homogenization into the Smart Healthcare Monitoring permits gathering, examining and learning from Internet of Things (IoT) wearable devices, undoubtedly achieving knowledge and making analysis on the patient's state. Despite several research works conducted on Smart Healthcare Monitoring, there remains certain amount of pitfalls, like, time, overhead involved in analysis and also the falsification of analysis. To focus on these issues, a Statistical Partial Regression and Support Vector Intelligent Agent Learning (SPR-SVIAL) for Smart Healthcare Monitoring is proposed. The SPR-SVIAL method is split into two stages. First, data pre-processing along with the dimensionality reduced features are extracted by employing Statistical Partial Regression Feature Extraction model. Here, with the ceaseless thump to-pulsate heart information, triaxial accelerometer information, rest quality, actual work and mental attributes obtained from the input dataset acquired from IoT wearable devices, Partial Least Square is applied to extract the dimensionality reduced features, therefore contributing to Smart Healthcare Monitoring time and accuracy. Next, with these resultant features, Support Vector Intelligent Agent Learning is proposed for Smart Healthcare Monitoring that with the aid of Machine Learning and Intelligent Agent not only reduces the falsification of analysis but also reduces the overhead incurred.

While there is no cure, levodopa therapy has been shown to mitigate symptoms. A patient on levodopa experiences cycles in the severity of their symptoms, characterized by an ON state—when the drug is active—and an OFF state—when symptoms worsen as the drug wears off. The longitudinal progression of the disease is monitored using episodic assessments performed by trained physicians in the clinic, such as the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Lately, there has been an effort in the field to develop continuous, objective measures of motor symptoms based on wearable sensors and other remote monitoring devices. In this work, we present an effort towards such a solution that uses a single wearable inertial sensor to automatically assess the postural instability and gait disorder (PIGD) of a Parkinson’s disease patient. Sensor data was collected from two independent studies of subjects performing the UPDRS test and then used to train and validate a convolutional neural network model. Given the typical limited size of such studies we also employed the use of generative adversarial networks to improve the performance of deep-learning models that usually require larger amounts of data for training. We show that for a 2-min walk test, our method’s predicted PIGD scores can be used to identify a patient’s ON/OFF states better than a physician evaluated on the same criteria.

For instance, recent human activity recognition (HAR) research has explored using wearable devices in applications such as remote monitoring of patients, detection of gait abnormalities, and cognitive disease identification. However, data collection poses a major challenge in developing HAR systems, especially because of the need to store data at a central location. This raises privacy concerns and makes continuous data collection difficult and expensive due to the high cost of transferring data from a user's wearable device to a central repository. Considering this, we explore the adoption of federated learning (FL) as a potential solution to address the privacy and cost issues associated with data collection in HAR. More specifically, we investigate the performance and behavioral differences between FL and deep learning (DL) HAR models, under various conditions relevant to real-world deployments. Namely, we explore the differences between the two types of models when (i) using data from different sensor placements, (ii) having access to users with data from heterogeneous sensor placements, (iii) considering bandwidth efficiency, and (iv) dealing with data with incorrect labels. Our results show that FL models suffer from a consistent performance deficit in comparison to their DL counterparts, but achieve these results with much better bandwidth efficiency. Furthermore, we observe that FL models exhibit very similar responses to those of DL models when exposed to data from heterogeneous sensor placements. Finally, we show that the FL models are more robust to data with incorrect labels than their centralized DL counterparts.  © 2013 IEEE."

It met several shortcomings in case of computational complexity, cost, time, and improper health care data storage and so forth. To overcome these challenges, the novel IoT-enabled secure healthcare monitoring model is proposed in this study. At first, several sensors are deployed in the human body thereby collecting patients' data with respect to vital parameters like body temperature deviation. The patient's health record dataset consists of 10 attributes namely phone numbers, marital status, address, age, name, heartbeat rate, oxygen level, smoking, temperature, and blood pressure. The data size reduction and normalization are performed in the IoT medical sensor dataset which contains the redundant or irrelevant attributes that are eliminated during pre-processing. The artificial hummingbird (AHB) algorithm-based convolutional neural network (AHB-CNN) model performs both feature extraction and classification of cancer disease. The AHB-CNN model classifies whether the patient is prone to cancer or not based on the sensor input collected. The received results are then sent to the hospital management for analysis.

A considerable change is taking place in the m-Health sector, since mobile devices, e.g., tablets and smartphones, are increasingly used by citizens. Starting from the need for social contact, through remote monitoring, up to homecare assistance, this chapter will focus on the design and development of m-Health applications that provide coaching services related to physical and cognitive exercise, social relationships and nutrition, to aging people and their formal and informal caregivers. When sensors and medical devices are integrated with m-Health technologies, the services’ development grows exponentially, including early detection and prevention, behavioral monitoring, coaching, etc. In this context, the eco-system becomes more complex since the sensors’ integration generates the acquisition of a large amount of data that requires the application of complex data analysis strategies, e.g., Artificial Intelligence (AI). At this point, the m-Health services to be provided to the final users, i.e., aging people and their caregivers, are based on a measurement process characterized by data acquisition, data analysis, and final service with increasing levels of uncertainty in all the steps of the measurement process. Human-centered design is here proposed as a methodological approach to provide the developers with an interpretation reference defined by the users’ needs, limitations and capabilities and a mean to challenge uncertainty based on user requirements and information needs. Coaching scenarios are data-driven flexible descriptions that require a representation of actions, events, or situations able to explain evidence-based user journeys and to trigger future behaviors, investigating its possible performance, the usage opportunities, the technical weaknesses and validating the design and development hypothesis before actual fulfillment. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."

Identifying the impact of levodopa on real-world motor state (e.g. ON/OFF/ DYSKINESIA) is important for both clinicians and people with PD. The aim of the present work was to automatically classify medication states using machine learning models. Continuous 7-day data were collected in 26 people with PD using an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) placed on the fifth lumbar vertebrae (L5) level. Over the week, each participant was asked to complete a diary by annotating medication states (off-condition and dyskinesias) with a 30-minute resolution. Diary entries were used as reference labels assigned to the processed IMU data. Two different networks were chosen for the classification: the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm (kNN) to identify ON-OFF-DYSKINESIA classes and Fine Tree (FT) to identify only OFF and ON classes. Preliminary results demonstrate that IMU data paired with machine learning could accurately classify ON-OFF and DYSKINESIA with 84% accuracy and the ON-OFF states were classified with 95% accuracy. These results are encouraging and pave the way to a better understanding of the effect that medication has on motor symptoms in PD during everyday life and may serve as a useful tool for optimizing clinical management of people with PD. © 2023 IEEE."

Continuous monitoring of multiple advanced physiological parameters during diuresis may allow better differentiation of patients into subgroups according to their responses. In this study, 29 HF patients were monitored during outpatient intravenous diuresis, using a noninvasive wearable multi-parameter monitor. Analysis of changes in these parameters during the course of diuresis aimed to recognize subgroups with different response patterns. Parameters did not change significantly, however, subgroup analysis of the last quartile of treatment showed significant differences in cardiac output, cardiac index, stroke volume, pulse rate, and systemic vascular resistance according to gender, and in systolic blood pressure according to habitus. Changes in the last quartile could be differentiated using k-means, a technique of unsupervised machine learning. Moreover, patients’ responses could be best clustered into four groups. Analysis of baseline parameters showed that two of the clusters differed by baseline parameters, body mass index, and diabetes status. To conclude, we show that physiological changes during diuresis in HF patients can be categorized into subgroups sharing similar response trends, making noninvasive monitoring a potential key to personalized treatment in HF. © 2022 by the authors."

The multi-source mixed-frequency health data overwhelm the modeling capacity of existing statistical and machine learning models, due to many challenging properties. Although predictive analytics for big health data plays an important role in telemonitoring, there is a lack of rigorous prediction model that can automatically predicts patients’ health conditions, e.g., Disease Severity Indicators (DSIs), from multi-source mixed-frequency data. Sleep disorder is a prevalent cardiac syndrome that is characterized by abnormal respiratory patterns during sleep. Although wearable devices are available to administrate sleep studies at home, the manual scoring process to generate the DSI remains a bottleneck in automated monitoring and diagnosis of sleep disorder. To address the multi-fold challenges for precise prediction of the DSI from high-dimensional multi-source mixed-frequency data in sleep disorder, we propose a sparse linear mixed model that combines the modified Cholesky decomposition with group lasso penalties to enable joint group selection of fixed effects and random effects. A novel Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm integrated with an efficient Majorization Maximization (MM) algorithm is developed for model estimation of the proposed sparse linear mixed model with group variable selection.

But, physical meetings are the biggest reason for the global pandemic. The healthcare industry is in a dire state of despair because of the spread of COVID, constrained health workers, and infrastructure. Healthcare accommodations are costlier than ever due to various reasons such as the global population getting busier and the rise in the number of chronic diseases. Nowadays, there is a high demand for healthcare support due to the increase in the aging population, the COVID-19 crisis, its postdisease difficulties, and other chronic diseases. Treating all the patients at hospitals is not practical nowadays due to limited healthcare facilities. The patients' care is all dependent on visits to the hospital physically, and to some extent, calls, text messages, and emails. This way it was not possible for the doctors to monitor the health of the patients continuously and assist them whenever needed. Recently, the Internet of Things (IoT) and various machine learning approaches have been widely explored in this sector. The IoT-based healthcare methods provide quality and efficiency during treatment. The IoT along with machine learning techniques can transform the healthcare industry by making it more accessible and less costly and make healthcare more facile by equipping the users with pocket amicable medical facilities. With IoT-enabled devices, remote monitoring can enable patients to better connect with doctors, thereby minimizing physical visits. It can equip doctors to easily keep track of their patient's health by utilizing wearables like fitness bands that can monitor various healthcare parameters. All these systems mostly use machine learning or deep learning approaches. This way, they will know whether to offer any immediate medical care or to make any changes to the current treatment.

Methods: We developed an Institutional Review Board–approved questionnaire to evaluate patient perceptions of remote monitoring technologies in a high-volume orthopedic center. Forty-seven THA patients (60% female; mean age: 66 years) and 50 nonoperative OA hip patients (52% female; mean age: 63 years) participated. Patient perceptions were compared using Pearson's chi-squared analyses. Results: THA patients were similarly interested in the use of smartphone apps (91% vs 94%, P =.695) in comparison to nonoperative hip OA patients. THA patients were more receptive to using wearable sensors (94% vs 44%, P <.001) relative to their nonoperative counterparts.

Using three optical sensors with four light sources, WrisTee allows users to measure 12 photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals at three locations on the radial artery. Two types of PPG signals with opposite polarities were discovered and designated as in-phase and invert-phase signals. We provided a unified viewpoint regarding their differences based on the Beer $-$ Lambert law, and showed that both signals can be used for heart monitoring using data analyzed from a selected subject. Using reflective pulse-transition time (R-PTT) and the standard deviation of R-PTT ($\sigma _{R\text{-}PTT}$), we proposed a method for selecting the optimal wavelength to achieve the best quality signal, thus minimizing storage requirements, power resources, and computational costs. We conducted an experiment on ten subjects to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed method. Our results demonstrated that WrisTee is capable of finding the optimal positions and wavelengths for monitoring vital signs. To automatically detect the PPG phases, six machine learning (ML) models were explored to assess their accuracy for PPG-phase classification. The experimental results show that a convolutional neural network can be the best candidate for phase classification. Hence, it can be integrated into WrisTee for noninvasive health monitoring such as heart rate, heart rate variability, or blood pressure.

A gold standard for quantitatively measuring physiotherapy participation is crucial to understanding physiotherapy adherence in managing recovery from LBP. Objective: This study aimed to develop and evaluate a system with wearable inertial sensors to objectively detect the performance of unsupervised exercises for LBP comprising movement in multiple planes and sitting postures. Methods: A quantitative classification design was used within a machine learning framework to detect exercise performance and posture in a cohort of healthy participants. A set of 8 inertial sensors were placed on the participants, and data were acquired as they performed 7 McKenzie low back exercises and 3 sitting posture positions. Engineered time series features were extracted from the data and used to train 9 models by using a 6-fold cross-validation approach, from which the best 2 models were selected for further study. In addition, a convolutional neural network was trained directly on the time series data. A feature importance analysis was performed to identify sensor locations and channels that contributed the most to the models. Finally, a subset of sensor locations and channels was included in a hyperparameter grid search to identify the optimal sensor configuration and best performing algorithms for exercise and posture classification. The final models were evaluated using the F1 score in a 10-fold cross-validation approach. Results: In total, 19 healthy adults with no history of LBP each completed at least one full session of exercises and postures. Random forest and XGBoost (extreme gradient boosting) models performed the best out of the initial set of 9 engineered feature models. The optimal hardware configuration was identified as a 3-sensor setup—lower back, left thigh, and right ankle sensors with acceleration, gyroscope, and magnetometer channels. The XGBoost model achieved the highest exercise (F1 score: mean 0.94, SD 0.03) and posture (F1 score: mean 0.90, SD 0.11) classification scores. The convolutional neural network achieved similar results with the same sensor locations, using only the accelerometer and gyroscope channels for exercise classification (F1 score: mean 0.94, SD 0.02) and the accelerometer channel alone for posture classification (F1 score: mean 0.88, SD 0.07). Conclusions: This study demonstrates the potential of a 3-sensor lower body wearable solution (eg, smart pants) that can identify exercises in multiple planes and proper sitting postures, which is suitable for the treatment of LBP.

Photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals non-invasively measured by wearable devices are extensively used to provide information about the cardiovascular system and its associated diseases. In this study, we propose an approach to optimize the quality assessment of the PPG signals. Methods: We used an ensemble-based feature selection scheme to enhance the prediction performance of the classification model to assess the quality of the PPG signals. Our approach for feature and subset size selection yielded the best-suited feature subset, which was optimized to differentiate between the clean and artifact corrupted PPG segments. Conclusion: A high discriminatory power was achieved between two classes on the test data by the proposed feature selection approach, which led to strong performance on all dependent and independent test datasets. We achieved accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity rates of higher than 0.93, 0.89, and 0.97, respectively, for dependent test datasets, independent of heartbeat type, i.e., atrial fibrillation (AF) or non-AF data including normal sinus rhythm (NSR), premature atrial contraction (PAC), and premature ventricular contraction (PVC). For independent test datasets, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity rates were greater than 0.93, 0.89, and 0.97, respectively, on PPG data recorded from AF and non-AF subjects. These results were found to be more accurate than those of all of the contemporary methods cited in this work. Significance: As the results illustrate, the advantage of our proposed scheme is its robustness against dynamic variations in the PPG signal during long-term 14-day recordings accompanied with different types of physical activities and a diverse range of fluctuations and waveforms caused by different individual hemodynamic characteristics, and various types of recording devices. This robustness instills confidence in the application of the algorithm to various kinds of wearable devices as a reliable PPG signal quality assessment approach.  © 1964-2012 IEEE."

Unfortunately, existing SV measurement methods are limited in the clinic because of their invasiveness (eg, thermodilution), location (eg, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging), or unreliability (eg, bioimpedance). Multimodal wearable sensing, leveraging the seismocardiogram, a sternal vibration signal associated with cardiomechanical activity, offers a means to monitoring SV conveniently, affordably, and continuously. However, it has not been evaluated in a population with significant anatomical and physiological differences (ie, children with CHD) or compared against a true gold standard (ie, cardiac magnetic resonance). Here, we present the feasibility of wearable estimation of SV in a diverse CHD population (N=45 patients). METHODS AND RESULTS: We used our chest-worn wearable biosensor to measure baseline ECG and seismocardiogram signals from patients with CHD before and after their routine cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging, and derived features from the measured signals, predominantly systolic time intervals, to estimate SV using ridge regression. Wearable signal features achieved acceptable SV estimation (28% error with respect to cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging) in a held-out test set, per cardiac output measurement guidelines, with a root-mean-square error of 11.48 mL and R2 of 0.76. Additionally, we observed that using a combination of electrical and cardiomechanical features surpassed the performance of either modality alone. CONCLUSIONS: A convenient wearable biosensor that estimates SV enables remote monitoring of cardiac function and may potentially help identify decompensation in patients with CHD. © 2022 The Authors."

The IDAA approach uses the Wasserstein distance metric for measuring the data distribution distance between the source and target subjects, and DeepTransHHAR model is used for feature extraction and activities recognition. Two publically available datasets HHAR and KU-HAR with non-identical properties in terms of the number of subjects, activities, wearable sensors (accelerometer and gyroscope), devices, and the sampling rates are used for experimental evaluation. The experimental result shows that the IDAA strategy helps to improve the HAR performance significantly in the non-identical environment. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The National Academy of Sciences, India."

Smart wearables have been increasingly important in recent technologies for monitoring and indicating our current health status, which is utilised to appropriately diagnose our health. Monitoring animals' health raises several concerns. We must wait for veterinary specialists to assess and diagnose whether the animals are suffering only in known regions. The result is delayed treatment and degradation of animal health. Therefore, primary health diagnosis is needed. However, mounting equipment was required to identify these features.

In order to identify movement and discomfort, the system utilizes the YOLOv3 model to detect the patient's body and the Alphapose method to extract different keypoints information of the patient's body. Applying association rules, the detected keypoints are then converted into six central body organs. To detect a patient's discomfort, pairwise distance is measured between detected keypoints, and finally, time frame rules are applied to set a threshold in order to analyze movements as either associated with normal or discomfort conditions. The patient's body is monitored continuously for multiple frames, based on which comfort and discomfort levels are distinguished.

There is an increase in research for advanced AI techniques, such as deep learning, to build predictive models for the early detection of diseases. Such predictive models leverage mobile health (mHealth) data from wearable sensors and smartphones to discover novel ways for detecting and managing chronic diseases and mental health conditions. Objective: Currently, little is known about the use of AI-powered mHealth (AIM) settings. Therefore, this scoping review aims to map current research on the emerging use of AIM for managing diseases and promoting health. Our objective is to synthesize research in AIM models that have increasingly been used for health care delivery in the last 2 years. Methods: Using Arksey and O'Malley's 5-point framework for conducting scoping reviews, we reviewed AIM literature from the past 2 years in the fields of biomedical technology, AI, and information systems. We searched 3 databases, PubsOnline at INFORMS, e-journal archive at MIS Quarterly, and Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Digital Library using keywords such as ""mobile healthcare,"" ""wearable medical sensors,"" ""smartphones"", and ""AI."" We included AIM articles and excluded technical articles focused only on AI models. We also used the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) technique for identifying articles that represent a comprehensive view of current research in the AIM domain. Results: We screened 108 articles focusing on developing AIM models for ensuring better health care delivery, detecting diseases early, and diagnosing chronic health conditions, and 37 articles were eligible for inclusion, with 31 of the 37 articles being published last year (76%). Of the included articles, 9 studied AI models to detect serious mental health issues, such as depression and suicidal tendencies, and chronic health conditions, such as sleep apnea and diabetes. Several articles discussed the application of AIM models for remote patient monitoring and disease management. The considered primary health concerns belonged to 3 categories: mental health, physical health, and health promotion and wellness. Moreover, 14 of the 37 articles used AIM applications to research physical health, representing 38% of the total studies. Finally, 28 out of the 37 (76%) studies used proprietary data sets rather than public data sets. We found a lack of research in addressing chronic mental health issues and a lack of publicly available data sets for AIM research. Conclusions: The application of AIM models for disease detection and management is a growing research domain. These models provide accurate predictions for enabling preventive care on a broader scale in the health care domain. Given the ever-increasing need for remote disease management during the pandemic, recent AI techniques, such as federated learning and explainable AI, can act as a catalyst for increasing the adoption of AIM and enabling secure data sharing across the health care industry. © 2022 JMIR Publications.

Symptoms of MS fluctuate, and standard biannual clinical visits cannot capture these fluctuations. Remote monitoring techniques that leverage wearable sensors have recently emerged as an approach sensitive to disease variability. Previous research has shown that fall risk can be identified from walking data collected by wearable sensors in controlled laboratory conditions however this data may not be generalizable to variable home environments. To investigate fall risk and daily activity performance from remote data, we introduce a new open-source dataset featuring data collected from 38 PwMS, 21 of whom are identified as fallers and 17 as non-fallers based on their six-month fall history. This dataset contains inertial-measurement-unit data from eleven body locations collected in the laboratory, patient-reported surveys and neurological assessments, and two days of free-living sensor data from the chest and right thigh. Six-month (n = 28) and one-year repeat assessment (n = 15) data are also available for some patients. To demonstrate the utility of these data, we explore the use of free-living walking bouts for characterizing fall risk in PwMS, compare these data to those collected in controlled environments, and examine the impact of bout duration on gait parameters and fall risk estimates. Both gait parameters and fall risk classification performance were found to change with bout duration. Deep learning models outperformed feature-based models using home data; the best performance was observed with all bouts for deep-learning and short bouts for feature-based models when evaluating performance on individual bouts. Overall, short duration free-living walking bouts were found to be the least similar to laboratory walking, longer duration free-living walking bouts provided more significant differences between fallers and non-fallers, and an aggregation of all free-living walking bouts yields the best performance in fall risk classification. © 2022 Meyer et al.

In this work, we propose an algorithm to classify stair climbing periods and estimate SCP from a lower-back worn accelerometer, which strongly agrees with the clinical standard (r = 0.92, p < 0.001; ICC = 0.90, [0.82, 0.94]). Data were collected in-lab from healthy adults (n = 65) performing the four-step SCPT and a walking assessment while instrumented (accelerometer + gyroscope), which allowed us to investigate tradeoffs between sensor modalities. Using two classifiers, we were able to identify periods of stair ascent with >89% accuracy [sensitivity = >0.89, specificity = >0.90] using two ensemble machine learning algorithms, trained on accelerometer signal features. Minimal changes in model performances were observed using the gyroscope alone (±0–6% accuracy) versus the accelerometer model.

The accurate activity classification results from the HAR enhance the performance of the healthcare system with broad applications. HAR results are useful in monitoring a person's health, and the system predicts abnormal activities based on user movements. The HAR system's abnormal activity predictions provide better healthcare monitoring and reduce users' health issues. The conventional HAR systems use wearable sensors, such as inertial measurement unit (IMU) and stretch sensors for activity recognition. These approaches show remarkable performances to the user's basic activities such as sitting, standing, and walking. However, when the user performs complex activities, such as running, jumping, and lying, the sensor-based HAR systems have a higher degree of misclassification results due to the reading errors from sensors. These sensor errors reduce the overall performance of the HAR system with the worst classification results. Similarly, radiofrequency or vision-based HAR systems are not free from classification errors when used in real time. In this paper, we address some of the existing challenges of HAR systems by proposing a human image threshing (HIT) machine-based HAR system that uses an image dataset from a smartphone camera for activity recognition. The HIT machine effectively uses a mask region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN) for human body detection, a facial image threshing machine (FIT) for image cropping and resizing, and a deep learning model for activity classification.

Such a feature enabled the bending sensor to simultaneously have a wide dynamic range of bending strain (0.025-5.4%), high gauge factor (∼74), and high linearity (R2∼0.99). Furthermore, the bending sensor can capture repeated instantaneous changes in strain and various types of vibrations, owing to its fast response time. Moreover, the bending direction can be differentiated with a single layer of the sensor, and using an array of sensors integrated on a glove, object recognition was demonstrated via machine learning. Finally, a self-monitoring proprioceptive ionic electroactive polymer (IEAP) actuator capable of operating in liquid was demonstrated. Such features of our bending sensor will enable a simple and effective way of detecting sophisticated motion, thus potentially advancing wearable healthcare monitoring electronics and enabling proprioceptive soft robotics. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

Moreover, it can also inflate the costs of existing health care systems because of the many metabolic complications that it can cause. The current methods for assessing malnutrition can be cumbersome. A trained practitioner must be present to conduct an assessment, or patients must travel to facilities with specialized equipment to obtain their measurements. Therefore, digital health care is a possible way of closing this gap as it is rapidly gaining traction as a scalable means of improving efficiency in the health care system. It allows for the remote monitoring of nutritional status without requiring the physical presence of practitioners or the use of advanced medical equipment. As such, there is an increasing interest in expanding the range of digital applications to facilitate remote monitoring and management of health issues. In this study, we discuss the feasibility of a novel digital remote method for diagnosing malnutrition using facial morphometrics. Many malnutrition screening assessments include subjective assessments of the head and the face. Facial appearance is often used by clinicians as the first point of qualitative indication of health status. Hence, there may be merit in quantifying these subtle but observable changes using facial morphometrics. Modern advancements in artificial intelligence, data science, sensors, and computing technologies allow facial features to be accurately digitized, which could potentially allow these previously intuitive assessments to be quantified. This study aims to stimulate further discussion and discourse on how this emerging technology can be used to provide real-time access to nutritional status. The use of facial morphometrics extends the use of currently available technology and may provide a scalable, easily deployable solution for nutritional status to be monitored in real time. This will enable clinicians and dietitians to keep track of patients remotely and provide the necessary intervention measures as required, as well as providing health care institutions and policy makers with essential information that can be used to inform and enable targeted public health approaches within affected populations. © Wesley Tay, Rina Quek, Bhupinder Kaur, Joseph Lim, Christiani Jeyakumar Henry."

A tiny single-patch monitor is more convenient than a conventional Holter monitor recording device and, therefore, longer duration of monitoring may be acceptable. Methods and Design: The CANDLE-AF study is a multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled trial. Patients with transient ischemic attack or ischemic stroke without any history of AF will be enrolled. The superiority of the 72-h single-patch monitor to standard strategy and non-inferiority of the 72-h single-patch monitor to an event-recorder-type device will be investigated. Single-patch monitor arm will repeat monitoring at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, event-recorder-type arm will repeat monitoring twice daily for 12 months. The enrollment goal is a total of 600 patients, and the primary outcome is the detection of AF which continues at least 30 s during study period. The secondary outcome is the rate of changes from antiplatelet to anticoagulant and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events within 1 year. Conclusions: The results of CANDLE-AF will clarify the role of a single-lead patch ECG for the early detection of AF in patients with acute ischemic stroke. In addition, the secondary outcome will be analyzed to determine whether more sensitive AF detection can affect the prognosis and if further device development is meaningful.

For continuous monitoring, widespread use, and prevention of cardiac events, advanced wearable technologies are emerging as promising surrogates for conventional 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) QT interval assessment. Previous studies have shown a good agreement between QT and corrected QT (QTc) intervals measured on a smartwatch ECG and a 12-lead ECG, but the clinical accuracy of computerized algorithms for QT and QTc interval measurement from smartwatch ECGs is unclear. Objective: The prospective observational study compared the smartwatch-recorded QT and QTc assessed using AccurKardia’s AccurBeat platform with the conventional 12-lead ECG annotated manually by a cardiologist. Methods: ECGs were collected from healthy participants (without any known cardiovascular disease) aged >22 years. Two consecutive 30-second ECG readings followed by (within 15 minutes) a 10-second standard 12-lead ECG were recorded for each participant. Characteristics of the participants were compared by sex using a 2-sample t test and Wilcoxon rank sum test. Statistical comparisons of heart rate (HR), QT interval, and QTc interval between the platform and the 12-lead ECG, ECG lead I, and ECG lead II were done using the Wilcoxon sign rank test. Linear regression was used to predict QTc and QT intervals from the ECG based on the platform’s QTc/QT intervals with adjustment for age, sex, and difference in HR measurement. The Bland-Altman method was used to check agreement between various QT and QTc interval measurements. Results: A total of 50 participants (32 female, mean age 46 years, SD 1 year) were included in the study. The result of the regression model using the platform measurements to predict the 12-lead ECG measurements indicated that, in univariate analysis, QT/QTc intervals from the platform significantly predicted QT/QTc intervals from the 12-lead ECG, ECG lead I, and ECG lead II, and this remained significant after adjustment for sex, age, and change in HR. The Bland-Altman plot results found that 96% of the average QTc interval measurements between the platform and QTc intervals from the 12-lead ECG were within the 95% confidence limit of the average difference between the two measurements, with a mean difference of –10.5 (95% limits of agreement –71.43, 50.43). A total of 94% of the average QT interval measurements between the platform and the 12-lead ECG were within the 95% CI of the average difference between the two measurements, with a mean difference of –6.3 (95% limits of agreement –54.54, 41.94). Conclusions: QT and QTc intervals obtained by a smartwatch coupled with the platform’s assessment were comparable to those from a 12-lead ECG. Accordingly, with further refinements, remote monitoring using this technology holds promise for the identification of QT interval prolongation. ©Sara Chokshi, Gulzhan Tologonova, Rose Calixte, Vandana Yadav, Naveed Razvi, Jason Lazar, Stan Kachnowski."

The present review addresses the current and potential future role of major e-health tools and approaches in respiratory medicine, with the aim of providing readers with trustful and updated evidence to increase their awareness of the topic, and to allow them to optimally benefit from the latest innovation technology. Collected literature evidence shows that the potential of technology tools in respiratory medicine mainly relies on three fundamental interactions: between clinicians, between clinician and patient, and between patient and health technology. However, it would be desirable to establish widely agreed and adopted standards for conducting trials and reporting results in this area, as well as to take into proper consideration potentially relevant pitfalls related to privacy protection and compliance with regulatory procedures. © 2022, The Author(s)."

Over 4 million Americans are hospitalized every year due to heart failure (HF), with a median length of stay of 4 days and an in-hospital mortality rate that exceeds 5%. Hospitalizations of patients with HF can be prevented by early detection of lung congestion. Our study assessed a new contact-free optical medical device used for the early detection of lung congestion. Methods: The Gili system is an FDA-cleared device used for measuring chest motion vibration data. Lung congestion in the study was assessed clinically and verified via two cardiologists. An algorithm was developed using machine learning techniques, and cross-validation of the findings was performed to estimate the accuracy of the algorithm. Results: A total of 227 patients were recruited (101 cases vs. 126 controls). The sensitivity and specificity for the device in our study were 0.91 (95% CI: 0.86–0.93) and 0.91 (95% CI: 0.87–0.94), respectively. In all instances, the observed estimates of PPVs and NPVs were at least 0.82 and 0.90, respectively. The accuracy of the algorithm was not affected by different covariates (including respiratory or valvular conditions). Conclusions: This study demonstrates the efficacy of a contact-free optical device for detecting lung congestion.

Other relevant signals, such as roll angle, inclination or a round kick evaluation, cannot be measured with them. This work proposes an alternative cadence-measurement system with less of the mentioned restrictions, without the need for distinct cadence-measurement apparatus attached to the pedal and shaft of the road bicycle. The proposed design applies an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to the seating pole of the bike. In an experiment, the motion data were gathered. A total of four different road cyclists participated in this study to collect different datasets for neural network training and evaluation. In total, over 10 h of road cycling data were recorded and used to train the neural network. The network’s aim was to detect each revolution of the crank within the data. The evaluation of the data has shown that using pure accelerometer data from all three axes led to the best result in combination with the proposed network architecture. A working proof of concept was achieved with an accuracy of approximately 95% on test data. As the proof of concept can also be seen as a new method for measuring cadence, the method was compared with the ground truth. Comparing the ground truth and the predicted cadence, it can be stated that for the relevant range of 50 rpm and above, the prediction over-predicts the cadence with approximately 0.9 rpm with a standard deviation of 2.05 rpm. The results indicate that the proposed design is fully functioning and can be seen as an alternative method to detect the cadence of a road cyclist. © 2022 by the authors."

However, there remain considerable challenges for AFFs to fulfill specific requirements of advanced applications due to their low electrical outputs, limitation in materials selection, and difficulty in regulating microstructures on narrow and curved surface of the fibers. In this study, fabricating and regulating honeycomb porous microstructures (HPMs) on one-dimensional nonplanar fiber surfaces were proposed and systematically studied for developing AFFs with customized functionalities. As a demonstration of application, multifunctional silver-plated nylon fibers surface-engineered with HPMs (SNF@HPMs) were developed with the assistance of the BF method and were further fabricated into SNF@HPMs-based triboelectric nanogenerator (SNF@HPMs-TENG). The SNF@HPMs-TENG showed considerable electrical performances with a power density of 390.8 mW/m2 and good long-term stability, which can power portable electronics as capacitors, calculator, watch, and light up 150 LEDs.

This research work proposed an innovative LoRa-loT-based intelligent healthcare system using Artificial intelligence. All patients' healthcare data can be transmitted to Cloud through the LoRA transceiver. Also, the bed up/down can be controlled through Online Voice Command using Artificial Intelligence. An intelligent hospital health remote control system has been proposed to monitor patients' health at a hospital and acquire a doctor's prescription. Doctors can also identify patients' illnesses using data collected remotely from them. Android-based mobile applications are utilized as an interface for web-based applications to execute effective real-time communication involving doctors and patients using LoRA-IoT. This approach uses five sensors to collect data from the hospital environment: a heart rate sensor, a body temperature sensor, a room-temperature sensor, a CO sensor, and a max30100 sensor. Incorporating specific functions in mobile intelligent hospital automation equipment enables remote monitoring at the hospital and makes life more comfortable.

Insoles instrumented with force-sensitive resistors (FSRs) are an unobtrusive, low-cost, and low-power technology for sampling GRF and CoP in real-world environments. However, FSRs have variable response characteristics that complicate estimation of GRF and CoP. This study introduces a unique data analytic pipeline that enables accurate estimation of GRF and CoP despite relatively inaccurate FSR responses. This paper also investigates whether inclusion of a complementary knee angle sensor improves estimation accuracy. Methods: Seventeen healthy subjects were equipped with an insole instrumented with six FSRs and a string-based knee angle sensor. Subjects walked in a straight line at self-selected slow, preferred, and fast speeds over an in-ground force platform. Twenty repetitions were performed for each speed. Supervised machine learning models estimated weight-normalized GRF and shoe size-normalized CoP, which were re-scaled to obtain GRF and CoP. Results: Anteroposterior GRF, Vertical GRF, and Anteroposterior CoP were estimated with a normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of less than 5%. Mediolateral GRF and CoP were estimated with an NRMSE of 8.1% and 6.4%, respectively. Knee angle-related features slightly improved GRF estimates.

Many countries have postponed their public screening programs and are fighting to maintain balance between essential health care and COVID-19 pandemic. At this point of time, IoT along with artificial intelligence (AI) provides a solution for a remote IoT based healthcare system. IoT based wearable devices collect data and send them to the cloud via IoT Gateway. Further, the data are analyzed by AI to raise alerts at times of emergencies like a sudden drop-in pulse rate etc. AI needs a large database for training and processing. This threatens the patient’s data security and privacy. To overcome this threat, an encryption algorithm can be used. When it comes to remote healthcare, monitoring of cardio vascular muscles is the most important of all. This can be done by an electrocardiogram (ECG). These ECG signals are transmitted in case of emergency and are stored in remote servers. The ECG signals are unique in nature and they can be used in biometric devices which attract hackers. To avoid the intruders, the data is encrypted and transmitted. In this paper, we provide a lightweight cellular automaton (CA) based encryption algorithm to suit limited power and low memory devices. For ECG based evaluation, the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database is considered. © 2021 Totem Publisher, Inc. All rights reserved."

However, over the years, various diseases have adversely affected the growth and sustainability of these societies. Among them, heart disease is escalating rapidly in both economically settled and undeveloped nations and leads to fatalities around the globe. To reduce the death ratio caused by this disease, there is a need for a framework to continuously monitor a patient's heart status, essentially doing early detection and prediction of heart disease. This paper proposes a scalable Machine Learning (ML) and Internet of Things-(IoT-) based three-layer architecture to store and process a large amount of clinical data continuously, which is needed for the early detection and monitoring of heart disease. Layer 1 of the proposed framework is used to collect data from IoT wearable/implanted smart sensor nodes, which includes various physiological measures that have significant impact on the deterioration of heart status. Layer 2 stores and processes the patient data on a local web server using various ML classification algorithms. Finally, Layer 3 is used to store the critical data of patients on the cloud.

This research study proposes a couple of locomotion detection methods using body-worn multi-sensors to successfully categorize several locomotion transitions. This research presents both standard and state-of-the-art methods for MS-DLD. Conventionally, to improve MS-DLD process, the proposed methodology consists of a wavelet transformed Quaternion-based filter for the inertial signals, patterns recognition in the form of kinematic-static energies, and state-of-the-art multi-features extraction. These features include entropy, spectral, and cepstral coefficients domains. Then, fuzzy logic-based optimization has been introduced in order to achieve the selective features by converting them into codewords. These nominated features with enhanced patterns are further detected by HMMs to improve the accuracy for classifying daily life locomotion actions. This paper also introduces another state-of-the-art way to model daily locomotion detection and derives body-specific modified HMMs. The model divides the sensor data into three active body-specific parts including head sensors, mid-body sensors, and lower body sensors. Body-specific modified HMMs have been provided with raw data for the three active body-specific sensors and gave better results with less computational complexities when compared to the conventional methods. The proposed systems have been experimentally assessed and trialed over three diverse publicly available datasets: the UP-Fall dataset consisting of falling and other daily life activities, the IM-WSHA dataset comprising everyday locomotion actions, and the ENABL3S gait and locomotion dataset consisting of multiple gait movements. Experimental outcomes indicate that the proposed conventional technique achieved improved results and outperformed existing systems based on detection accuracies of 90.0% and 87.5% over UP-Fall, 86.0% and 88.3% over IM-WSHA, and 86.7% and 90.0% over ENABL3S datasets for kinematic and static energy patterns, respectively.

The aims of this study were firstly to employ deep neural networks to convert IMU data to ankle joint angles that are indistinguishable from those derived from motion capture-based inverse kinematics (IK) - the reference standard; and secondly, to validate the robustness of this approach across contrasting walking speeds in healthy individuals. Kinematics data were simultaneously calculated using IMUs and IK from 9 subjects during walking on a treadmill at 0.5 m/s, 1.0 m/s and 1.5 m/s. A generative adversarial network was trained using gait data at two of the walking speeds to predict ankle kinematics from IMU data alone for the third walking speed. There were significant differences between IK and IMU joint angle predictions for ankle eversion and internal rotation during walking at 0.5 m/s and 1.0 m/s (p < 0.001); however, no significant differences in joint angles were observed between the generative adversarial network prediction and IK at any speed or plane of joint motion (p < 0.05). The RMS difference in ankle joint kinematics between the generative adversarial network and IK for walking at 1.0 m/s was 3.8°, 2.1° and 3.5° for dorsiflexion, inversion and axial rotation, respectively.

The large amount of data collected demands automatic analysis pipelines to extract gait parameters that can be used as clinical endpoints. We introduce a deep learning-based automatic pipeline for wearables that processes tri-axial accelerometry data and extracts gait events—bout segmentation, initial contact (IC), and final contact (FC)—from a single sensor located at either the lower back (near L5), shin or wrist. The gait events detected are posteriorly used for gait parameter estimation, such as step time, length, and symmetry. We report results from a leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) validation on a pilot study dataset of five participants clinically diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and six healthy controls (HC). Participants wore sensors at three body locations and walked on a pressure-sensing walkway to obtain reference gait data. Mean absolute errors (MAE) for the IC events ranged from 22.82 to 33.09 milliseconds (msecs) for the lower back sensor while for the shin and wrist sensors, MAE ranges were 28.56–64.66 and 40.19–72.50 msecs, respectively. For the FC-event detection, MAE ranges were 29.06–48.42, 40.19–72.70 and 36.06–60.18 msecs for the lumbar, wrist and shin sensors, respectively. Intraclass correlation coefficients, ICC(2,k), between the estimated parameters and the reference data resulted in good-to-excellent agreement (ICC ≥ 0.84) for the lumbar and shin sensors, excluding the double support time (ICC = 0.37 lumbar and 0.38 shin) and swing time (ICC = 0.55 lumbar and 0.59 shin).

Automation of hospital beds using advanced robotics and sensors has been a growing trend exacerbated by the COVID crisis. In this exploratory study, a polynomial regression (PR) machine learning (ML) RAM algorithm based on a Dreyfusian descriptor for immediate wellbeing monitoring was proposed for the autonomous hospital bed transport (AHBT) application. This method was preferred over several other AI algorithm for its simplicity and quick computation. The algorithm quantified historical data using supervised photoplethysmography (PPG) data for 5 min just before the start of the autonomous journey, referred as pre-journey (PJ) dataset. During the transport process, the algorithm continued to quantify immediate measurements using non-overlapping sets of 30 PPG waveforms, referred as in-journey (IJ) dataset. In combination, this algorithm provided a binary decision condition that determined if AHBT should continue its journey to destination by checking the degree of polynomial (DoP) between PJ and IJ. Wrist PPG was used as algorithm’s monitoring parameter. PPG data was collected simultaneously from both wrists of 35 subjects, aged 21 and above in postures mimicking that in AHBT and were given full freedom of upper limb and wrist movement. It was observed that the top goodness-of-fit which indicated potentials for high data accountability had 0.2 to 0.6 cross validation score mean (CVSM) occurring at 8th to 10th DoP for PJ datasets and 0.967 to 0.994 CVSM at 9th to 10th DoP for IJ datasets. CVSM was a reliable metric to pick out the best PJ and IJ DoPs. Central tendency analysis showed that coinciding DoP distributions between PJ and IJ datasets, peaking at 8th DoP, was the precursor to high algorithm stability. Mean algorithm efficacy was 0.20 as our proposed algorithm was able to pick out all signals from a conscious subject having full freedom of movement. This efficacy was acceptable as a first ML proof of concept for AHBT. There was no observable difference between subjects’ left and right wrists. © 2021 by the authors.

The practitioner gives the instructions while wearing the device, and the patient has to reproduce the gestures. A processing unit is dedicated to compute statistical features and calculate the success rate. The second one is human motion tracking for elderly care. A novel machine learning architecture is proposed, based on feature fusion, to predict the activities of daily living. Results: The rehabilitation mechanism was tested under supervised conditions, by performing a set of movements. D-SORM provides extra information and objective measurements, thus facilitates the diagnosis of clinicians. The human activity recognition is also validated using a public dataset. With D-SORM, an efficiency ranging from 97.7% to 99.65% is ensured under unsupervised conditions. Conclusions: The proposed design constitutes a digital clinical tool for medical teams allowing remote health monitoring. It overcomes geographical barriers while providing faster and highly accurate assessment. © 2021 Elsevier B.V."

Depending on the light absorption at 350–2500 nm, the sunlight-responsive photothermochromic fabric (SPTCF) exposed under the irradiation power density of 500 W m−2 for 4 min displays efficient photothermal conversion, resulting in the increase in temperature from room temperature (23.0 °C) to above 47.0 °C. Simultaneously, the color of SPTCF changes from blue to white and returns to blue once the light is turned off for 3 min, indicating the sensitive and reversible photothermochromic property of the SPTCF.

To overcome these issues, we proposed Enriched Salp Swarm Optimization based Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (ESSOBiLSTM) to monitor health. This method consists of four layers, such as the data collection layer, data storage layer, data analytics, and presentation layer.

Methods This soft launch was conducted at NorthShore University HealthSystem's Evanston Hospital from December 2020 to March 2021. Patients were provided with non-invasive wearable biosensors that continuously collect ambulatory physiological data, and a study phone that collects patient-reported outcomes. The physiological data are analyzed by machine learning algorithms, potentially identifying physiological perturbation in HF patients. Alerts from this algorithm may be cascaded with other patient status data to inform home health nurses' (HHNs') management via a structured protocol. HHNs review the monitoring platform daily. If the patient's status meets specific criteria, HHNs perform assessments and escalate patient cases to the HF team for further guidance on early intervention. Results We enrolled five patients into the soft launch. Four participants adhered to study activities. Two out of five patients were readmitted, one due to HF, one due to infection. Observed miscommunication and protocol gaps were noted for protocol amendment. The study team adopted an organizational development method from change management theory to reconfigure the study protocol. Conclusion We sought to automate the monitoring aspects of post-discharge care by aligning a new technology that generates streaming data from a wearable device with a complex, multi-provider workflow into a novel protocol using iterative design, implementation, and evaluation methods to monitor post-discharge HF patients.

This review looks at how various healthcare scientific sectors are assisting in the fight against the pandemic, as well as how innovative implementations are being used to treat or cure illness. An analysis of the technical landscape in the COVID-19 sense enables some tentative reflections about the conditions of technical involvement in fighting this once-in-a-century pandemic. Firstly, unlike previous global health crises, it seems to turn people from monitoring artefacts and epidemiological analysis through information creation topics via self-tracking, information sharing, and digital information flows. Furthermore, even if many of such innovations were not implemented, in a previous medical crisis background, their extensive usage on a world basis raises concern about the extent of mobilising domestic spying techniques on racial equality and also worries about government agencies retaining higher monitoring rates long after the end of the pandemic.

The main purpose of this article is to employ machine learning algorithms for Blood Pressure (BP) measurement classification in real-time. Data is gathered from the human body through a multilevel Wireless Medical Sensors Network (WMSN) architecture that is deployed to acquire, analyze, and monitor BP remotely.

Afterward, the best classifier is implemented in the BP sensor node to identify the BP status. The second layer is responsible for data aggregation in the Cloud and alerting when an anomaly occurs in BP measurement. The third layer is configured to present BP information continuously to the health professionals and patients using the Internet of Things (IoT) platform that retrieves data from the cloud. The evaluation results show better accuracy, i.e. 97.9% using the decision tree classifier.

This report attempts to focus on two important things: the classification of respiration signals from sensor data using deep learning and the disposability of devices. The use of the novel Janus MoSSe quantum dot (MoSSe QD) structure allows for stable respiration sensing because of unchanged wear rates under humid conditions, and also, the electron affinity and work function values suggest that MoSSe has a higher tendency to donate electrons and interact with the hydrogen molecule. Furthermore, for the real-time classification of different respiration signals, a 1D convolutional neural network (1D CNN) was incorporated.

The poor reliability of self-reported seizure diaries for many people with epilepsy is well-established, but these records remain necessary in clinical care and therapeutic studies. A number of wearable devices have emerged, which may be capable of detecting seizures, recording seizure data, and alerting caregivers. Developments in non-invasive wearable sensors to measure accelerometry, photoplethysmography (PPG), electrodermal activity (EDA), electromyography (EMG), and other signals outside of the traditional clinical environment may be able to identify seizure-related changes. Non-invasive scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and minimally invasive subscalp EEG may allow direct measurement of seizure activity. However, significant network and computational infrastructure is needed for continuous, secure transmission of data. The large volume of data acquired by these devices necessitates computer-assisted review and detection to reduce the burden on human reviewers. Furthermore, user acceptability of such devices must be a paramount consideration to ensure adherence with long-term device use. Such devices can identify tonic–clonic seizures, but identification of other seizure semiologies with non-EEG wearables is an ongoing challenge. Identification of electrographic seizures with subscalp EEG systems has recently been demonstrated over long (>6 month) durations, and this shows promise for accurate, objective seizure records. While the ability to detect and forecast seizures from ambulatory intracranial EEG is established, invasive devices may not be acceptable for many individuals with epilepsy. Recent studies show promising results for probabilistic forecasts of seizure risk from long-term wearable devices and electronic diaries of self-reported seizures. There may also be predictive value in individuals' symptoms, mood, and cognitive performance. However, seizure forecasting requires perpetual use of a device for monitoring, increasing the importance of the system's acceptability to users. Furthermore, long-term studies with concurrent EEG confirmation are lacking currently.

There is a great need in healthcare for remote monitoring of COVID-19 symptoms. In the past year, a number of IoT-based devices and wearables have been introduced by researchers, providing good results in terms of high accuracy in diagnosing patients in the prodromal phase and in monitoring the symptoms of patients, i.e., respiratory rate, heart rate, temperature, etc. In this systematic review, we analyzed these wearables and their need in the healthcare system. The research was conducted using three databases: IEEE Xplore®, Web of Science®, and PubMed Central®, between December 2019 and June 2021. This article was based on the PRISMA guidelines. Initially, 1100 articles were identified while searching the scientific literature regarding this topic. After screening, ultimately, 70 articles were fully evaluated and included in this review. These articles were divided into two categories. The first one belongs to the on-body sensors (wearables), their types and positions, and the use of AI technology with ehealth wearables in different scenarios from screening to contact tracing. In the second category, we discuss the problems and solutions with respect to utilizing these wearables globally. This systematic review provides an extensive overview of wearable systems for the remote management and automated assessment of COVID-19, taking into account the reliability and acceptability of the implemented technologies. © 2021 by the authors.

However, traditional plastic or elastomer substrates with impermeability, uncomfortableness, mechanical mismatches, and nondegradability greatly restricted their practical applications. Therefore, the fabrication of such pressure sensors with high flexibility, facile degradability, and breathability is still a critical challenge and highly desired. Herein, we present a wearable, breathable, degradable, and highly sensitive MXene/protein nanocomposites-based pressure sensor. The fabricated MXene/protein-based pressure sensor is assembled from a breathable conductive MXene coated silk fibroin nanofiber (MXene-SF) membrane and a silk fibroin nanofiber membrane patterned with a MXene ink-printed (MXene ink-SF) interdigitated electrode, which can serve as the sensing layer and the electrode layer, respectively. The assembled pressure sensor exhibits a wide sensing range (up to 39.3 kPa), high sensitivity (298.4 kPa-1 for 1.4-15.7 kPa; 171.9 kPa-1 for 15.7-39.3 kPa), fast response/recovery time (7/16 ms), reliable breathability, excellent cycling stability over 10 »000 cycles, good biocompatibility, and robust degradability. Furthermore, it shows great sensing performance in monitoring human psychological signals, acting as an artificial skin for the quantitative illustration of pressure distribution, and wireless biomonitoring in real time. Considering the biodegradable and breathable features, the sensor may become promising to find potential applications in smart electronic skins, human motion detection, disease diagnosis, and human-machine interaction.  ©"

The integration of innovative technologies, such as the Internet of Things, wearable technologies, artificial intelligence, and ambient-assisted living applications, represents a valuable solution for this scope. Designing such an integrated system requires addressing several aspects (eg, equipment selection, data management, analytics, costs, and users'needs) and involving different areas of expertise (eg, medical science, service design, biomedical and computer engineering). Objective: The objective of this study is 2-fold; we aimed to design the functionalities of a smart health platform addressing 5 chronic conditions prevalent in the older population (ie, hearing loss, cardiovascular diseases, cognitive impairments, mental health problems, and balance disorders) by considering both older adults'and clinicians' perspectives and to evaluate the identified smart health platform functionalities with a small group of older adults. Methods: Overall, 24 older adults (aged >65 years) and 118 clinicians were interviewed through focus group activities and web-based questionnaires to elicit the smart health platform requirements. Considering the elicited requirements, the main functionalities of smart health platform were designed. Then, a focus group involving 6 older adults was conducted to evaluate the proposed solution in terms of usefulness, credibility, desirability, and learnability. Results: Eight main functionalities were identified and assessed-cognitive training and hearing training (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 6/6, 100%; learnability: 6/6, 100%), monitoring of physiological parameters (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 6/6, 100%; learnability: 5/6, 83%), physical training (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 5/6, 83%; learnability: 2/6, 33%), psychoeducational intervention (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 4/6, 67%; learnability: 2/6, 33%), mood monitoring (usefulness: 4/6, 67%; credibility: 4/6, 67%; desirability: 3/6, 50%; learnability: 5/6, 50%), diet plan (usefulness: 5/6, 83%; credibility: 4/6, 67%; desirability: 1/6, 17%; learnability: 2/6, 33%), and environment monitoring and adjustment (usefulness: 1/6, 17%; credibility: 1/6, 17%; desirability: 0/6, 0%; learnability: 0/6, 0%). Most of them were highly appreciated by older participants, with the only exception being environment monitoring and adjustment. The results showed that the proposed functionalities met the needs and expectations of users (eg, improved self-management of patients' disease and enhanced patient safety). However, some aspects need to be addressed (eg, technical and privacy issues). Conclusions: The presented smart health platform functionalities seem to be able to meet older adults' needs and desires to enhance their self-awareness and self-management of their medical condition, encourage healthy and independent living, and provide evidence-based support for clinicians' decision-making. Further research with a larger and more heterogeneous pool of stakeholders in terms of demographics and clinical conditions is needed to assess system acceptability and overall user experience in free-living conditions. © 2022 JMIR Publications Inc..

As in other fields, this evolution follows progressive improvements in the technology, the availability of new components and materials, and construct of novel software and algorithms. Methods: Review of the literature describing NIRS monitoring of the urologic system (bladder, pelvic floor, urinary sphincter, brain). Results: The advent of lasers and development of fiberoptics established NIRS as a viable entity, and allowed transcutaneous monitoring of physiologic changes in the bladder detrusor muscle during spontaneous voiding. Small light emitting diodes which traded depth of penetration for portability led to wearable devices when combined with wireless capability; emitter and photodiode refinement, spatially resolved geometry, and software and algorithm development spawned the current generation of compact, robust multipotential devices, including a transvaginal interface able to quantify reoxygenation recovery in pelvic floor muscles, and interrogate the urinary sphincter. Functional NIRS allows brain mediated neural activity linked to bladder sensation and control of voiding to be mapped in real time during evaluation of voiding dysfunction; simultaneous fNIRS during fMRI is also feasible. Wearable devices linked to wireless peripherals enable serial monitoring at home of voiding parameters once only available in the hospital setting; exploration of artificial intelligence will further expand the urologic relevance of NIRS. Conclusions: The technological advances evident in urologic applications of NIRS mirror those occurring in other fields.  © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

Four Epilog sensors are combined as part of Epitel's Remote EEG Monitoring platform (REMI) to create 10 channels of EEG for remote patient monitoring. REMI is designed to provide comprehensive spatial EEG recordings that can be administered by non-specialized medical personnel in any medical center. The purpose of this study was to determine how accurate epileptologists are at remotely reviewing Epilog sensor EEG in the 10-channel “REMI montage,” with and without seizure detection support software. Three board certified epileptologists reviewed the REMI montage from 20 subjects who wore four Epilog sensors for up to 5 days alongside traditional video-EEG in the EMU, 10 of whom experienced a total of 24 focal-onset electrographic seizures and 10 of whom experienced no seizures or epileptiform activity. Epileptologists randomly reviewed the same datasets with and without clinical decision support annotations from an automated seizure detection algorithm tuned to be highly sensitive. Blinded consensus review of unannotated Epilog EEG in the REMI montage detected people who were experiencing electrographic seizure activity with 90% sensitivity and 90% specificity. Consensus detection of individual focal onset seizures resulted in a mean sensitivity of 61%, precision of 80%, and false detection rate (FDR) of 0.002 false positives per hour (FP/h) of data. With algorithm seizure detection annotations, the consensus review mean sensitivity improved to 68% with a slight increase in FDR (0.005 FP/h). As seizure detection software, the automated algorithm detected people who were experiencing electrographic seizure activity with 100% sensitivity and 70% specificity, and detected individual focal onset seizures with a mean sensitivity of 90% and mean false alarm rate of 0.087 FP/h. This is the first study showing epileptologists' ability to blindly review EEG from four Epilog sensors in the REMI montage, and the results demonstrate the clinical potential to accurately identify patients experiencing electrographic seizures. Additionally, the automated algorithm shows promise as clinical decision support software to detect discrete electrographic seizures in individual records as accurately as FDA-cleared predicates. © Copyright © 2021 Frankel, Lehmkuhle, Spitz, Newman, Richards and Arain."

MXene is regarded as one of the most ideal candidate sensing materials due to its high electrical conductivity and controllable interlayer space. However, the easy-to-oxidize characteristic of MXene materials greatly restricts the sensitivity and reliability of sensor devices, especially in wet climates. Herein, a highly sensitive and waterproof flexible pressure sensor using a free-standing hydrophobic bacterial cellulose/Ti3C2Tx MXene (HBT) hybrid film as a sensing layer is fabricated by facile and effective nanocellulose intercalation and fluorine modification strategies. The obtained pressure sensor delivers high sensitivity (65.5 kPa-1), fast response (50 ms), wide linear sensing range (0.002-30 kPa) with a low detection limit of 0.57 Pa, and excellent repeatability over 50,000 cycles. Meanwhile, owing to the highly hydrophobic surface of the HTB film, the outstanding sensing features could be well retained, although immersed in water several times. Benefiting from the excellent sensing properties and water resistance, the HBT sensor serves as a wearable force sensor to monitor the full-range human physiological motions regardless of whether the conditions are normal or wet. This work provides a new pathway to design the MXene pressure sensor with high reliability and demonstrates the promising usage of HBT sensors in portable biomedical electronics. © 2022 American Chemical Society."

In the last decade, successful applications of S-HAR have been presented through fruitful academic research and industrial applications, including for healthcare monitoring, smart home controlling, and daily sport tracking. However, the growing requirements of many current applications for recognizing complex human activities (CHA) have begun to attract the attention of the HAR research field when compared with simple human activities (SHA). S-HAR has shown that deep learning (DL), a type of machine learning based on complicated artificial neural networks, has a significant degree of recognition efficiency. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are two different types of DL methods that have been successfully applied to the S-HAR challenge in recent years. In this paper, we focused on four RNN-based DL models (LSTMs, BiLSTMs, GRUs, and BiGRUs) that performed complex activity recognition tasks. The efficiency of four hybrid DL models that combine convolutional layers with the efficient RNN-based models was also studied. Experimental studies on the UTwente dataset demonstrated that the suggested hybrid RNN-based models achieved a high level of recognition performance along with a variety of performance indicators, including accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix. The experimental results show that the hybrid DL model called CNN-BiGRU outperformed the other DL models with a high accuracy of 98.89% when using only complex activity data. Moreover, the CNN-BiGRU model also achieved the highest recognition performance in other scenarios (99.44% by using only simple activity data and 98.78% with a combination of simple and complex activities). © 2021 by the authors.

Methods: The work was based on the guidelines of the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. The publication search was carried out using PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases. Studies published during the period from 2014 until January 2022 were selected for the analysis. The evaluation of risk of bias for the included studies was conducted using the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias tool. Results and Discussion: An overall 5513 studies were assessed for eligibility after which 39 studies were included. The main trend in the mobile health for cardiological applications is the use of different types of wearable devices and Artificial Intelligence-platforms. In fact, mobile technology allows remotely to monitor, interpret, and analyze biomedical data collected from the patient. Conclusion: The results of this literature search demonstrated that patients diagnosed with cardiovascular disorders can potentially benefit from the application of mHealth in cardiology. However, despite the proven advantages of mHealth for cardiology, there are many challenges and concerns regarding effectiveness, safety, reliability and the lack of official regulation and guidelines from official organizations.

Several time series signals, such as electrocardiographic or electromyographic signals, can, in fact, be acquired anytime and anywhere, providing the least possible discomfort to the patient, thanks to the continuous development of increasingly advanced devices. While the unceasing acquisition of data contributes to the improvement of the patient care process, the sheer volume of the resulting data makes the analysis and processing of such data difficult and particularly burdensome. The integration of wearable sensors with Artificial Intelligence contributes to the realization of faster, more easily applied and more cost-effective solutions aimed at improving early diagnosis, personalized treatment, remote patient monitoring and better decision making with a consequent reduction in healthcare costs. The increase in the use and application of these techniques, together with the continuous development of new models, raises the question of which technique is the most reliable and accurate in the analysis of such data, in addition to rendering the information explainable and understandable.

One such neuro-degenerative disorder is Parkinson's Disease (PD). It is categorized by motor symptoms that affect a patient's motor skills and non-motor symptoms that affect the general health of a PD patient. The quality of life of a patient with PD is highly compromised. To date, there is no cure for the disease, but early intervention and assistive care can help a PD patient to perform daily activities with considerable ease. Many research works in PD management discuss the challenges that healthcare professionals face in the early detection and management of this disease. Sensor devices have been promising to overcome these challenges to a certain degree because of the low cost and accuracy in measurement, yielding precise conclusive results to detect, monitor, and manage PD. This paper presents a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) that provides an in-depth analysis of the PD symptoms, Motor and Non-Motor Symptoms (NMS), the current diagnosis and management techniques used and their efficacy. The paper also highlights the work of various researchers in wearable sensors and their proposals to improve the quality of life of a PD patient by diagnosing, monitoring, and managing PD symptoms remotely via wearable sensors. Another area of focus is commercially available wearables for PD management and a few promising works in progress.

The framework is designed using wearable and or with a mobile device for extracting bioelectrical signals and context awareness data. The framework uses bioelectrical signals for authentication while artificial intelligence is applied using the contextual data to enhance the patient data integrity. The framework applied different security levels to balance between usability and security on the bases of False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and False Rejection Rate (FRR). 30 people are used for the evaluation of the different security levels and the security level 1 achieved a result based on usability vs security obtaining FAR of 5.6% and FRR of 9% but when the FAR is at 0% the FRR stood at 29%.

Coronavirus infection 2019 refers to a sickness caused by a single coronavirus that Wuhan, China, was the first discovery site. (COVID-19). The COVID-19 virus could be a one-of-a-kind virus related to respiratory disorders and various common colds. Direct contact with an inflamed person's respiratory droplets (which can be formed by coughing and sneezing) and contacting virus-infested surfaces are also ways for the virus to spread. The COVID-19 virus can survive for hours on end on surfaces. A variety of physiological changes are linked to COVID-19 and other viral diseases, which can be monitored with the help of wearable sensors. Heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), RHR, and RR should be used as potential markers of COVID-19 infection. Additional changes to ECG waveforms should include data indicating the occurrence of infection. Stress, recovery, exercise, and sleep are just a few of the more complicated metrics that may be tracked by many wearables. These metrics are often derived by combining cardiac and accelerometer data. Since numerous observations are combined into one, these metrics should have a larger SNR and consequently a higher predictive value than raw signals alone. A significant frequency of fever and metabolic symptoms in COVID19 necessitates monitoring of core temperature and blood vessel O saturation (SpO2). Mobile business devices don't typically take these kinds of measurements these days. As countries seek to expand testing, testing solutions must be both technically sound practical and user-friendly. Nucleic acid and antibody testing are two types of in vitro diagnostic (IVD) test that employ biological materials such as blood to detect the RNA of the virus and the antibodies the body has produced in reaction to the virus. In addition to chest radiography and computed tomography machines, there are also deep learning detection methods and portable devices.

Elderly individuals at home or in senior centers typically contact their physicians once a serious medical condition is obvious. There are very few systems with automated means of monitoring the health of individuals recovering from an injury or monitoring their progress when conducting telerehabilitation using wearables, remote cameras, and the cloud. To address these automation and long-term health monitoring issues, we have developed a multi-modal platform that employs common, low-cost wearables, and teleconferencing tools that takes advantage of cloud streaming services. One modality is based on Visual IoT and edge devices that automatically connect as teleconferencing clients to record human subjects' telerehabilitation and teletreatment sessions and push these recordings to cloud storage. We performed experiments applying two different deep learning models to the cloud video streams to track whole-body skeleton motion or to detect hand keypoints during telerehabilitation. The rehabilitation maybe associated with recovery from a stroke or other similar incident. The other modality of our platform includes an Apple Watch ® App that pushes users' physiological and kinematic data to the cloud and automatically generates data analytics dashboards for use by clinicians. Both, the wearables-based and the Visual IoT-based modalities complement each other in telerehabilitation or teletreatment controlled by clinicians.

Our proposed diagnostic device is to be designed to achieve the highest classification results with accuracy and sensitivity. Our proposed monitoring device is to monitor the movement and activity of elderly people, especially those who are suffering from chronic and Parkinson’s disease. The people who are suffering from Parkinson’s disease are in need of fall detection services, and elderly people who are in need of continuous monitoring are target users of the proposed device. The proposed automatic diagnostic system reduces the challenges of interpreting the visual subtle changes occurring in the ECG waveforms. Our proposed diagnostic device is to be designed to achieve highest classification result with accuracy and sensitivity. This device comprises of heart beat (pulse), ECG and PCG sensors with high sensitivity. These sensors continuously read the pulse rate, ECG signals, and cardiac sounds. The measured ECG signal then undergoes feature extraction phase where the required coordinates for disease classification were derived using Hilbert transform and principal component analysis. After extracting the essential features from the QRS complex of ECG, they were given as input to the artificial neural network classifier, which is trained to diagnose the diseases from obtained features of ECG. The PCG signal is detected by PCG sensor, which represents various valve closures and openings along with murmurs. Z-transform is used finding the envelope of the PCG signal, which is considered to be the effective information about heart sounds. The coefficients are extracted from the PCG signal using linear predictive coding. The classifiers use the training data to understand how the given input variables are related to the class. When the classifier is trained accurately, it can be used to detect the diagnosed disease. There are several classifiers used in order to find the best accuracy. In our proposed system, we have used automated backpropagation network (BPN), convolutional neural network with Boltzman, decision tree, k-singular valve decomposition with method of optimal directions and Pan-Tompkins algorithm.

Phase I will involve data collection for the digital data hub of the National Institutes of Health as well as data to support the preliminary development of the CDI. Phase II will involve data collection for the hub and contribute to continued refinement and validation of the CDI. While this study will focus on the development of a CDI, the digital platform will also be evaluated for feasibility and usability while clinicians deliver care to continuously monitored patients enrolled in the study. Results: Our target CDI will be a binary classifier trained to distinguish participants with and those without decompensation. The primary performance metric for CDI will be the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve with a minimum performance criterion of ≥0.75 (α=.05; power [1-β]=0.80). Furthermore, we will determine the sex or gender and race or ethnicity of the participants, which would account for differences in the CDI performance, as well as the lead time-time to predict decompensation-and its relationship with the ultimate disease severity based on the World Health Organization COVID-19 ordinal scale. Conclusions: Using machine learning techniques on a large data set of patients with COVID-19 could provide valuable insights into the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and a digital biomarker for COVID-19 decompensation. Through this study, we intend to develop a tool that can uniquely reflect physiological data of a diverse population and contribute to high-quality data that will help researchers better understand COVID-19. ©Karen Larimer, Stephan Wegerich, Joel Splan, David Chestek, Heather Prendergast, Terry Vanden Hoek."

For labor management, the diagnosis of fetal presentation is essential to guarantee delivery viability. A direct indicator of fetal presentation is the fetal head location, which can be placed close to the canal birth (cephalic, head-first) or far from the canal birth (breech, feet first). Unlike urban areas, the population in rural zones experience difficulties in accessing healthcare monitoring. Although telemedicine has helped bring medical technology closer to these regions, the diagnosis still requires medical specialists. This study presents an automatic three-stage detection framework for assessing the fetal head position (and hence the fetal presentation). The first stage involves applying morphological filtering, intensity-based thresholding, and shapebased filtering for a preliminary head detection and segmentation. The second stage comprises segmentation enhancement using a combinatory approach. The third stage uses the detection results to depict the spatial location likelihood of the head, which indicates the head location and fetal presentation. Fifteen volunteers in the third trimester of pregnancy were evaluated, and the fetal presentation was diagnosed. These results were compared with the diagnosis of a radiologist (used as a gold standard). The proposed method presented a 100% accuracy in determining the fetal presentation, albeit a limited number of cases evaluated. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

We evaluated the classification performance of the classifier using both accelerometer and gyroscope data. For this work, we develop a smartphone application for data collection from the eSense. Several statistical features are exploited to recognize head- and mouth-related activities (e.g., head nodding, head shaking, eating, and speaking), and regular activities (e.g., stay, walk, and speaking while walking). We explored different types of machine learning approaches like Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Random Forest (RnF), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Support Vector Machine (SVM), etc., for classifying activities.

Innovative, practical strategies to improve monitoring of glycemic health are desperately needed. In this proof-of-concept study, we explore the relationship between non-invasive wearables and glycemic metrics and demonstrate the feasibility of using non-invasive wearables to estimate glycemic metrics, including hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and glucose variability metrics. Research design and methods We recorded over 25 000 measurements from a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) with simultaneous wrist-worn wearable (skin temperature, electrodermal activity, heart rate, and accelerometry sensors) data over 8-10 days in 16 participants with normal glycemic state and pre-diabetes (HbA1c 5.2-6.4). We used data from the wearable to develop machine learning models to predict HbA1c recorded on day 0 and glucose variability calculated from the CGM. We tested the accuracy of the HbA1c model on a retrospective, external validation cohort of 10 additional participants and compared results against CGM-based HbA1c estimation models. Results A total of 250 days of data from 26 participants were collected. Out of the 27 models of glucose variability metrics that we developed using non-invasive wearables, 11 of the models achieved high accuracy (<10% mean average per cent error, MAPE). Our HbA1c estimation model using non-invasive wearables data achieved MAPE of 5.1% on an external validation cohort. The ranking of wearable sensor's importance in estimating HbA1c was skin temperature (33%), electrodermal activity (28%), accelerometry (25%), and heart rate (14%). Conclusions This study demonstrates the feasibility of using non-invasive wearables to estimate glucose variability metrics and HbA1c for glycemic monitoring and investigates the relationship between non-invasive wearables and the glycemic metrics of glucose variability and HbA1c.

We develop from first principles an approximation to their behavior using Gaussian process regression and demonstrate the utility of the technique for estimating the excitation time-series of leg muscles during normal walking for nine healthy subjects. Specifically, excitations for six muscles were estimated using surface electromyography (sEMG) data during a finite time interval (called the input window) from four different muscles (called the input muscles) with mean absolute error (MAE) less than 5.0% of the maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) and that accounts for 82-88% of the variance (VAF) in the true excitations. Further, these estimated excitations informed muscle activations with less than 4.0% MAE and 89-93% VAF. We also present a detailed analysis of a number of different modeling choices, including every possible combination of four-, three- and two-muscle input sets, the size and structure of the input window, and the stationarity of the Gaussian process covariance functions.

Physiological signals like electrocardiography (ECG), photoplethysmography (PPG), heart rate variability (HRV), and ballistocardiography (BCG) can be used to monitor health status but are not directly correlated with BP measurements. The manual detection of HT using these physiological signals is time consuming and prone to human errors. Hence, many computer-aided diagnosis systems have been developed. This paper is a systematic review of studies conducted on the automated detection of HT using ECG, HRV, PPG and BCG signals. In this review, we have identified 23 studies out of 250 screened papers, which fulfilled our eligibility criteria. Details of the study methods, physiological signal studied, database used, various nonlinear techniques employed, feature extraction, and diagnostic performance parameters are discussed. The machine learning and deep learning based methods based on ECG and HRV signals have yielded the best performance and can be used for the development of computer-aided diagnosis of HT. This work provides insights that may be useful for the development of wearable for continuous cuffless remote monitoring of BP based on ECG and HRV signals. © 2021 by the authors.

Remote monitoring of elderly and disabled people living in smart homes is highly challenging due to probable accidents which might occur due to daily activities such as falls. For elderly people, fall is considered as a major reason for death of post-traumatic complication. So, early identification of elderly people falls in smart homes is needed to increase the survival rate of the person or offer required support. Recently, the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), IoT, wearables, smartphones, etc. makes it feasible to design fall detection systems for smart homecare. In this view, this paper presents an IoT enabled elderly fall detection model using optimal deep convolutional neural network (IMEFD-ODCNN) for smart homecare. The goal of the IMEFD-ODCNN model is to enable smartphones and intelligent deep learning (DL) algorithms to detect the occurrence of falls in the smart home. Primarily, the input video captured by the IoT devices is pre-processed in different ways like resizing, augmentation, and min-max based normalization. Besides, SqueezeNet model is employed as a feature extraction technique to derive appropriate feature vectors for fall detection. In addition, the hyperparameter tuning of the SqueezeNet model takes place using the salp swarm optimization (SSO) algorithm. Finally, sparrow search optimization algorithm (SSOA) with variational autoencoder (VAE), called SSOA-VAE based classifier is employed for the classification of fall and non-fall events. Finally, in case of fall event detected, the smartphone sends an alert to the caretakers and hospital management. The performance validation of the IMEFD-ODCNN model takes place on UR fall detection dataset and multiple cameras fall dataset. The experimental outcomes highlighted the promising performance of the IMEFD-ODCNN model over the recent methods with the maximum accuracy of 99.76% and 99.57% on the multiple cameras fall and UR fall detection dataset.  © 2013 IEEE."

We evaluated if a novel wearable, continuous temperature monitor (Verily Patch) can reliably estimate body temperature and early detect fevers in an outpatient setting in patients at a high risk of febrile neutropenia (FN) who recently underwent chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Methods: 86 patients at a high risk for FN were prospectively enrolled at Mayo Clinic, MN. Patients wore the device in their axilla region for 7 days post ASCT and recorded self-measured oral temperatures every 3 hours. Patients were also followed using clinical standard-of-care procedures with daily oral temperature assessment. The clinic-and patient-assessed oral temperatures were used to develop and evaluate Verily Patch's body temperature and early fever detection algorithms using a K-fold cross-validation approach. Results: The Verily Patch reliably measured body temperatures with an error of 0.35 ± 0.88°F in comparison to clinic-and patient-assessed oral temperatures. The sensitivity and specificity of the patch in detecting clinic-assessed fever episodes was 90.2% and 87.8%. The patch detected 14.3 times the number of clinic-assessed fever episodes with a median lead time of 4.3 hours.

In this proof-of-concept study, we propose to use objective sensor data from the PKG and apply machine learning to cluster patients based on levodopa regimens and response. The resulting clusters are then used to enhance treatment planning by providing improved initial treatment estimates to supplement a physician’s initial assessment. We apply kmeans clustering to a dataset of within-subject Parkinson’s medication changes—clinically assessed by the MDS-Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale-III (MDS-UPDRS-III) and the PKG sensor for movement staging. A random forest classification model was then used to predict patients’ cluster allocation based on their respective demographic information, MDS-UPDRS-III scores, and PKG time-series data. Clinically relevant clusters were partitioned by levodopa dose, medication administration frequency, and total levodopa equivalent daily dose—with the PKG providing similar symptomatic assessments to physician MDS-UPDRS-III scores. A random forest classifier trained on demographic information, MDS-UPDRS-III scores, and PKG time-series data was able to accurately classify subjects of the two most demographically similar clusters with an accuracy of 86.9%, an F1 score of 90.7%, and an AUC of 0.871.

Medical 4.0, if implemented, can adequately handle the ongoing situation in the medical field as it will provide applications of advanced technologies to take care of the challenges of the COVID-19 outbreak. This paper studies Medical 4.0 exclusively and also in the context of COVID-19. The paper provides a brief of the significant medical revolution that has happened so far and identifies the significant supporting technologies of Medical 4.0. It also discusses the primary capabilities of Medical 4.0 for healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. The roles of Medical 4.0 in healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic are studied, and finally, this paper identifies 10 significant applications of Medical 4.0 in healthcare during COVID-19-type pandemics. We observe that the contemporary phase of development and mass-level production of intelligent medical devices has not happened in the same way as it has happened for smart electronic devices and application devices. Engineers will have a prominent role in taking up the healthcare challenges that can reach the common man. © World Scientific Publishing Co."

Methods: The watch measures single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), tri-axial seismocardiogram (SCG), and multi-wavelength photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals to compute the pulse transit time (PTT), allowing for BP estimation. We sent our custom watch device and an oscillometric BP cuff home with 21 healthy subjects, and captured the natural variability in BP over the course of a 24-hour period. Results: After calibration, our Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.69 and root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of 2.72 mmHg suggest that noninvasive PTT measurements correlate with around-the-clock BP. Using a novel two-point calibration method, we achieved a RMSE of 3.86 mmHg. We further demonstrated the potential of a semi-globalized adaptive model to reduce calibration requirements. Conclusion: This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first time that BP has been comprehensively estimated noninvasively using PTT in an at-home setting. We showed a more convenient method for obtaining ambulatory BP than through the use of the standard oscillometric cuff. We presented new calibration methods for BP estimation using fewer calibration points that are more practical for a real-world scenario. Significance: A custom watch (SeismoWatch) capable of taking multiple BP measurements enables reliable remote monitoring of daily BP and paves the way towards convenient hypertension screening and management, which can potentially reduce hospitalizations and improve quality of life.  © 2013 IEEE."

In this paper, we design placing the sensors at different body parts under different activities to determine the best sensor location. In addition, we develop SCG noise removal algorithm and utilize machine learning approach to perform biometric authentication tasks. We validate the proposed methods on 20 healthy young adults. The dataset contains acceleration data of sitting, standing, walking, and sitting post-exercise activities with the sensor placed at the wrists, neck, heart and sternum.

When these people live alone, it is convenient that a caregiver or family member visits them periodically. However, these visits do not prevent falls when the elderly person is alone. Furthermore, in exceptional circumstances, such as a pandemic, we must avoid unnecessary mobility. This is why remote monitoring systems are currently on the rise, and several commercial solutions can be found. However, current solutions use devices attached to the waist or wrist, causing discomfort in the people who wear them. The users also tend to forget to wear the devices carried in these positions. Therefore, in order to prevent these problems, the main objective of this work is designing and recollecting a new dataset about falls, falling risks and activities of daily living using an ankle-placed device obtaining a good balance between the different activity types.

2021,Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice,10.1111/jep.13528,"Brault, N.; Saxena, M.",For a critical appraisal of artificial intelligence in healthcare: The problem of bias in mHealth,,"Rationale, aims and objectives: Artificial intelligence and big data are more and more used in medicine, either in prevention, diagnosis or treatment, and are clearly modifying the way medicine is thought and practiced. Some authors argue that the use of artificial intelligence techniques to analyze big data would even constitute a scientific revolution, in medicine as much as in other scientific disciplines. Moreover, artificial intelligence techniques, coupled with mobile health technologies, could furnish a personalized medicine, adapted to the individuality of each patient. In this paper we argue that this conception is largely a myth: what health professionals and patients need is not more data, but data that are critically appraised, especially to avoid bias. Methods: In this historical and conceptual article, we focus on two main problems: first, the data and the problem of its validity; second, the inference drawn from the data by AI, and the establishment of correlations through the use of algorithms. We use examples from the contemporary use of mobile health (mHealth), i.e. the practice of medicine and public health supported by mobile or wearable devices such as mobile phones or smart watches. Results: We show that the validity of the data and of the inferences drawn from these mHealth data are likely to be biased. As biases are insensitive to the size of the sample, even if the sample is the whole population, artificial intelligence and big data cannot avoid biases and even tend to increase them. Conclusions: The large amount of data thus appears rather as a problem than a solution. What contemporary medicine needs is not more data or more algorithms, but a critical appraisal of the data and of the analysis of the data. Considering the history of epidemiology, we propose three research priorities concerning the use of artificial intelligence and big data in medicine. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

RPM systems are based on the collection of patient vital signs extracted using invasive and noninvasive techniques, then sending them in real-time to physicians.

The medical Internet of Things (MIoT) can be applied to wearable devices, remote diagnosis, mobile medical treatment, and remote monitoring. There is a large amount of medical information in the databases of various medical institutions. Nevertheless, due to the particularity of medical data, it is extremely related to personal privacy, and the data cannot be shared, resulting in data islands. Federated learning (FL), as a distributed collaborative artificial intelligence method, provides a solution. However, FL also involves multiple security and privacy issues. This paper proposes an adaptive Differential Privacy Federated Learning Medical IoT (DPFL-MIoT) model. Specifically, when the user updates the model locally, we propose a differential privacy federated learning deep neural network with adaptive gradient descent (DPFLAGD-DNN) algorithm, which can adaptively add noise to the model parameters according to the characteristics and gradient of the training data. Since privacy leaks often occur in downlink, we present differential privacy federated learning (DP-FL) algorithm where adaptive noise is added to the parameters when the server distributes the parameters. Our method effectively reduces the addition of unnecessary noise, and at the same time, the model has a good effect.

To further augment the efficiency of these applications wearable sensors, electronic skin, smart sensors, etc., were fabricated with a variety of materials combination. Among many sensors, temperature, pressure and volume (plethysmo) sensors are widely used in healthcare to monitor vital signs: body temperature(BT), heart rate (HR), blood pressure(BP), respiration rate (RR) and oxygen saturation (Osat). These readings are called vital signs because they all must be present for life to continue. Vital signs measurement by wearable tactile/ pressure sensors for healthcare monitor are most widely researched in the recent years due to their promising application in a distributed healthcare system. Hence, it is important to understand both the basics of vital signs and their measurement by various transduction based tactile sensors in details to devise a suitable sensor for vital signs monitor. In the literature, there are many research articles on vital signs monitor by pressure sensors with qualitative data and, some times, exaggerated claims of measurements and suitability of a sensor for specific vital sign measurement. However, for real applications one need quantitative parameters of a sensor for a particular application. Thus it may worth to separate the wheat from the chaff by studying the fundamentals of vital signs, measurement requirements and limitations of measuring techniques etc., in details. This information is missing in the literature. Hence we have systematically presented the various electrical transduction based tactile or pressure sensor technologies, sensor fabrication methods, sensor characteristics modification, basics of vital signs, and measurement techniques. The past three years literature on respective vital sign measurement were also presented here. It is inferred that the tactile sensor should be highly sensitive in linear working range of 30–190 mmHg (4–25 kPa) to measure blood pressure, heart rate and respiration rate. However, the required sensitivity value is not yet determined for each of the above measurements, in the literature. Both resistance and capacitance tactile sensors’ sensitivity and linear working range can be enhanced by employing biomimetic surface microstructures, 3D porous microstructures, intrafillable microstructures, metallic fillers, ionic liquids, etc., The details of each method is described in the article under suitable section.

The possibility to remotely monitor patients at home by means of smart sensors and medical devices has a dramatic impact on the quality of health services. Situation awareness plays an essential role in the decision-making process about the users, patients in this case, and their behaviors. Leveraging an Edge Computing framework, with embedded Artificial Intelligence capabilities to process near real-time data gathered from connected smart devices, would provide automatic decision support, thus improving the physicians’ course of action. In this paper we introduce, within an Edge AI framework, a dedicated module, called Clinical Pathway Adherence Checker (CPAC), which identifies the discrepancies between the modeled clinical pathway and the observed one by means of process mining techniques, and hence detecting early clinical deterioration of patient conditions.

As there is no effective therapy or vaccine yet, rigorous implementation of traditional public health measures such as isolation and quarantine remains the most effective tool to control the outbreak. When an asymptomatic individual with COVID-19 exposure is being quarantined, it is necessary to perform temperature and symptom surveillance. As such surveillance is intermittent in nature and highly dependent on self-discipline, it has limited effectiveness. Advances in biosensor technologies made it possible to continuously monitor physiological parameters using wearable biosensors with a variety of form factors. Objective To explore the potential of using wearable biosensors to continuously monitor multidimensional physiological parameters for early detection of COVID-19 clinical progression. Method This randomised controlled open-labelled trial will involve 200-1000 asymptomatic subjects with close COVID-19 contact under mandatory quarantine at designated facilities in Hong Kong. Subjects will be randomised to receive a remote monitoring strategy (intervention group) or standard strategy (control group) in a 1:1 ratio during the 14 day-quarantine period. In addition to fever and symptom surveillance in the control group, subjects in the intervention group will wear wearable biosensors on their arms to continuously monitor skin temperature, respiratory rate, blood pressure, pulse rate, blood oxygen saturation and daily activities. These physiological parameters will be transferred in real time to a smartphone application called Biovitals Sentinel. These data will then be processed using a cloud-based multivariate physiology analytics engine called Biovitals to detect subtle physiological changes. The results will be displayed on a web-based dashboard for clinicians' review. The primary outcome is the time to diagnosis of COVID-19.

Machine learning algorithms are frequently applied in HAR systems to learn from labeled sensor data. The effectiveness of these algorithms generally relies on having access to lots of accurately labeled training data. But labeled data for HAR is hard to come by and is often heavily imbalanced in favor of one or other dominant classes, which in turn leads to poor recognition performance.In this study we introduce a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based approach for HAR that we use to automatically synthesize balanced and realistic sensor data. GANs are robust generative networks, typically used to create synthetic images that cannot be distinguished from real images. Here we explore and construct a model for generating several types of human activity sensor data using a Wasserstein GAN (WGAN). We assess the synthetic data using two commonly-used classifier models, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). We evaluate the quality and diversity of the synthetic data by training on synthetic data and testing on real sensor data, and vice versa. We then use synthetic sensor data to oversample the imbalanced training set. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method on two publicly available human activity datasets, the Sussex-Huawei Locomotion (SHL) and Smoking Activity Dataset (SAD). We achieve improvements of using WGAN augmented training data over the imbalanced case, for both SHL (0.85 to 0.95 F1-score), and for SAD (0.70 to 0.77 F1-score) when using a CNN activity classifier. © 2020 IEEE."

2020,Journal of Medical Internet Research,10.2196/20641,"Park, E.; Lee, K.; Han, T.; Nam, H.S.",Automatic grading of stroke symptoms for rapid assessment using optimized machine learning and 4-limb kinematics: Clinical validation study,,"Background: Subtle abnormal motor signs are indications of serious neurological diseases. Although neurological deficits require fast initiation of treatment in a restricted time, it is difficult for nonspecialists to detect and objectively assess the symptoms. In the clinical environment, diagnoses and decisions are based on clinical grading methods, including the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score or the Medical Research Council (MRC) score, which have been used to measure motor weakness. Objective grading in various environments is necessitated for consistent agreement among patients, caregivers, paramedics, and medical staff to facilitate rapid diagnoses and dispatches to appropriate medical centers. Objective: In this study, we aimed to develop an autonomous grading system for stroke patients. We investigated the feasibility of our new system to assess motor weakness and grade NIHSS and MRC scores of 4 limbs, similar to the clinical examinations performed by medical staff. Methods: We implemented an automatic grading system composed of a measuring unit with wearable sensors and a grading unit with optimized machine learning. Inertial sensors were attached to measure subtle weaknesses caused by paralysis of upper and lower limbs. We collected 60 instances of data with kinematic features of motor disorders from neurological examination and demographic information of stroke patients with NIHSS 0 or 1 and MRC 7, 8, or 9 grades in a stroke unit. Training data with 240 instances were generated using a synthetic minority oversampling technique to complement the imbalanced number of data between classes and low number of training data. We trained 2 representative machine learning algorithms, an ensemble and a support vector machine (SVM), to implement auto-NIHSS and auto-MRC grading. The optimized algorithms performed a 5-fold cross-validation and were searched by Bayes optimization in 30 trials. The trained model was tested with the 60 original hold-out instances for performance evaluation in accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC). Results: The proposed system can grade NIHSS scores with an accuracy of 83.3% and an AUC of 0.912 using an optimized ensemble algorithm, and it can grade with an accuracy of 80.0% and an AUC of 0.860 using an optimized SVM algorithm. The auto-MRC grading achieved an accuracy of 76.7% and a mean AUC of 0.870 in SVM classification and an accuracy of 78.3% and a mean AUC of 0.877 in ensemble classification. Conclusions: The automatic grading system quantifies proximal weakness in real time and assesses symptoms through automatic grading. The pilot outcomes demonstrated the feasibility of remote monitoring of motor weakness caused by stroke. The system can facilitate consistent grading with instant assessment and expedite dispatches to appropriate hospitals and treatment initiation by sharing auto-MRC and auto-NIHSS scores between prehospital and hospital responses as an objective observation. © Eunjeong Park, Kijeong Lee, Taehwa Han, Hyo Suk Nam.

Also, enabled by technological advancements and electronics miniaturization, wearable health device (WHD) applications are expected to grow exponentially. This, in turn, may make 4P medicine (predictive, precise, preventive and personalized) a more attainable goal within dialysis patient care. This article discusses different use cases where WHD could be of relevance for dialysis patient care, i.e. measurement of heart rate, arrhythmia detection, blood pressure, hyperkalaemia, fluid overload and physical activity. After adequate validation of the different WHD in this specific population, data obtained from WHD could form part of a body area network (BAN), which could serve different purposes such as feedback on actionable parameters like physical inactivity, fluid overload, danger signalling or event prediction. For a BAN to become clinical reality, not only must technical issues, cybersecurity and data privacy be addressed, but also adequate models based on artificial intelligence and mathematical analysis need to be developed for signal optimization, data representation, data reliability labelling and interpretation. Moreover, the potential of WHD and BAN can only be fulfilled if they are part of a transformative healthcare system with a shared responsibility between patients, healthcare providers and the payors, using a step-up approach that may include digital assistants and dedicated 'digital clinics'.

The goal of the present study was to investigate whether a multi-parameter sensor could be used during a standardized activity test to interpret functional capacity in the longitudinal follow-up of CR patients. A total of 129 patients were followed for 3 months during CR using 6-min walking tests (6MWT) equipped with a wearable ECG and accelerometer device. Functional capacity was assessed based on 6MWT distance (6MWD). Linear and nonlinear interpretable models were explored to predict 6MWD. The t-distributed stochastic neighboring embedding (t-SNE) technique was exploited to embed and visualize high dimensional data. The performance of support vector machine (SVM) models, combining different features and using different kernel types, to predict functional capacity was evaluated. The SVM model, using chronotropic response and effort as input features, showed a mean absolute error of 42.8 m (±36.8 m).

This could lead to a state of healthcare services being out of reach of ordinary people making them unproductive and prone to chronic diseases. The Internet of Things (IoT) has tremendously transformed and revolutionized the way present healthcare services are being provided to patients. The technology allows remote monitoring in the healthcare sector, helping in the continuous and safe monitoring of a patient’s health condition, and empowering physicians to deliver quality healthcare at reasonable costs. The level of patient/doctor interaction has increased tremendously leading to widespread satisfaction with improved healthcare efficiency among patients due to the ease of interaction with healthcare providers. It has also helped to reduce the duration and length of hospital stay for patients, having a major impact on reducing the healthcare costs and improving treatment outcomes. Several applications in the healthcare sector employing IoT are presently available to benefit healthcare providers, hospitals, insurance companies, and patients at large. IoT has largely benefited critically ill patients and the elderly population living alone who require continuous monitoring due to their diseased condition by tracking their health conditions on a regular basis and allowing any disturbances or changes in routine daily living activities to trigger an alarm to a family member or concerned healthcare providers for an immediate check on their condition and provide instant care and treatment to avoid any fatalities or long-term damage. However, several potential challenges exist while designing any IoT-based healthcare system such as security and privacy, user identification and authentication, and regular communication and exchange of healthcare data, which need to be addressed before the technology can be adopted on a wider scale. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Unluckily, the AP actuator, an insulin pump, is subject to failures, with potentially serious consequences for subject safety. This calls for the development of advanced monitoring systems, leveraging the unprecedented data availability. This paper tackles for the first time the problem of automatically detecting pump faults with multidimensional data-driven anomaly detection (AD) methodologies. The approach allows to avoid the subtask of identifying a physiological model, typical of model-based approaches. Furthermore, we employ unsupervised methods, removing the need of labeled data for training, hardly available in practice. The adopted data-driven AD methods are local outlier factor, connectivity-based outlier factor, and isolation forest. Moreover, we propose a modification of these methods to cope with the dynamic nature of the underlying problem. The algorithms were tuned and tested on: 1) two-synthetic 100-patients' data set, of one-month data each, generated using the 'UVA/Padova T1D Simulator,' a large-scale nonlinear computer simulator of T1D subject physiology, largely adopted in AP research and accepted by the American Food and Drug Administration as a replacement of preclinical animal trials for AP and 2) a real 7-patients' data set consisting of one month in free-living conditions. The satisfactory accuracy of the proposed approach paves the way to the embedding of these methodologies in AP systems or their deployment in remote monitoring systems. © 1993-2012 IEEE."

However, such techniques are not always effectively implemented or timely available in the routine clinical practice. In recent years, the widespread availability of e-health solutions has stimulated the development of blood pressure telemonitoring (BPT) systems, which allow remote BP tracking and tighter and more efficient monitoring of patients’ health status. Recent Findings: There is currently strong evidence that BPT may be of benefit for hypertension screening and diagnosis and for improving hypertension management. The advantage is more significant when BPT is coupled with multimodal interventions involving a physician, a nurse or pharmacist, and including education on lifestyle and risk factors and drug management. Several randomized controlled studies documented enhanced hypertension management and improved BP control of hypertensive patients through BPT. Potential additional effects of BPT are represented by improved compliance to treatment, intensification, and optimization of drug use, improved quality of life, reduction in risk of developing cardiovascular complications, and cost-saving. Applications based on m-health and making use of wearables or smartwatches integrated with machine learning models are particularly promising for the future development of efficient BPT solutions, and they will provide remarkable support decision tools for doctors. Summary: BPT and telehealth will soon disrupt hypertension management.

More and more modern technologies are applied in surveillance and monitoring. Healthcare monitoring is growing ubiquitous in modern wearable devices, such as a smart watch, electrocardiogram (ECG) necklace, smart band. Many sensors are attached to these smart devices to record and monitor physiological signals caused by activities, and then propagated those recorded electrical data to be further processed to give health diagnosis, disease prevention or making a distress call automatically. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a sleep disorder with a high occurrence in adult people and observed as an autonomous risk factor for circulatory problems such as ischemic heart attacks and stroke. Numerous traditional neural network based methods have been developed to detect OSA, where these methods however could not provide the intended result because they rely on shallow network. In this paper, we propose an effective OSA detection based on Convolutional neural network. Our method first extracts features from Apnea-Electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings using RR-intervals (time interval from one R-wave to the next R-wave in an ECG signal) and then CNN model having three convolution layers and three fully connected layers is trained with extracted features and applied for OSA detection. The first two convolution layers are followed by batch normalization and pooling layer, and softmax is connected to the last fully connected layer to give final decision. Experimental results on extracted feature of Apnea-ECG signal reveal that our model have better results in terms of performance measure sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. It is expected that the related technology can be applied into smart sensors, especially wearable devices. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

Bespoke subject-specific treatment (medication or deep brain stimulation (DBS)) is critical for management, yet depends on precise assessment cardinal PD symptoms - bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor. Clinician diagnosis is the basis of treatment, yet it allows only a cross-sectional assessment of symptoms which can vary on an hourly basis and is liable to inter- and intra-rater subjectivity across human examiners. Automated symptomatic assessment has attracted significant interest to optimise treatment regimens between clinician visits, however, no wearable has the capacity to simultaneously assess all three cardinal symptoms. Challenges in the measurement of rigidity, mapping muscle activity out-of-clinic and sensor fusion have inhibited translation. In this study, we address all through a novel wearable sensor system and machine learning algorithms. The sensor system is composed of a force-sensor, three inertial measurement units (IMUs) and four custom mechanomyography (MMG) sensors. The system was tested in its capacity to predict Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores based on quantitative assessment of bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor in PD patients. 23 PD patients were tested with the sensor system in parallel with exams conducted by treating clinicians and 10 healthy subjects were recruited as a comparison control group. Results prove the system accurately predicts UPDRS scores for all symptoms (85.4% match on average with physician assessment) and discriminates between healthy subjects and PD patients (96.6% on average).

This systematic review aims to investigate the comparative effectiveness, safety, and cost for virtual or remote clinic interventions for patients with CIEDs and explores how outcomes may be influenced by patient or system factors in-depth. Methods: We will perform a systematic literature search in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Proquest Dissertations & Theses, other EBM Reviews, and trial registry databases. Two authors will independently screen titles and abstracts for eligibility. We will include randomized and non-randomized controlled trials, quasi-randomized and experimental studies, cohort, and case-control studies. Study populations of interest are individuals with a CIED (pacemaker, ICD, CRT). Eligibility will be restricted to virtual or remote follow-up or care interventions compared to any other approach. The co-primary outcomes of interest are mortality and patient satisfaction. Secondary outcomes include clinical effectiveness (e.g., ICD shock, time-to-detection of medical event, hospitalizations), safety (e.g., serious or device-related adverse events), device efficacy (e.g., transmissions, malfunctions), costs, workflow (e.g., resources, process outcomes, time-saved), and patient reported (e.g., burden, quality of life). Data will be extracted by one author and checked by a second using a standardized template. We will use published frameworks to capture data relevant to intervention effects that may be influenced by intervention definition or complexity, context and setting, or in socially disadvantaged populations. Detailed descriptive results will be presented for all included studies and outcomes, and where feasible, synthesized using meta-analysis. Risk of bias will be assessed by two review authors independently using Cochrane Risk of Bias tools. Certainty of evidence will be assessed using the GRADE approach. Discussion: Increases in number of CIEDs implanted, combined with an aging population and finite health resource allocations at the system-level may lead to increased reliance on virtual follow-up or care models in the future.

One of the key components of an ICU is the continuous monitoring of patients' vital parameters. However, existing advances in informatics, signal processing, or engineering that could alleviate the burden on ICUs have not yet been applied. This could be due to the lack of user involvement in research and development. Objective: This study focused on the satisfaction of ICU staff with current patient monitoring and their suggestions for future improvements. We aimed to identify aspects of monitoring that interrupt patient care, display devices for remote monitoring, use cases for artificial intelligence (AI), and whether ICU staff members are willing to improve their digital literacy or contribute to the improvement of patient monitoring. We further aimed to identify differences in the responses of different professional groups. Methods: This survey study was performed with ICU staff from 4 ICUs of a German university hospital between November 2019 and January 2020. We developed a web-based 36-item survey questionnaire, by analyzing a preceding qualitative interview study with ICU staff, about the clinical requirements of future patient monitoring. Statistical analyses of questionnaire results included median values with their bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals, and chi-square tests to compare the distributions of item responses of the professional groups. Results: In total, 86 of the 270 ICU physicians and nurses completed the survey questionnaire. The majority stated they felt confident using the patient monitoring equipment, but that high rates of false-positive alarms and the many sensor cables interrupted patient care. Regarding future improvements, respondents asked for wireless sensors, a reduction in the number of false-positive alarms, and hospital standard operating procedures for alarm management. Responses to the display devices proposed for remote patient monitoring were divided. Most respondents indicated it would be useful for earlier alerting or when they were responsible for multiple wards. AI for ICUs would be useful for early detection of complications and an increased risk of mortality; in addition, the AI could propose guidelines for therapy and diagnostics. Transparency, interoperability, usability, and staff training were essential to promote the use of AI. The majority wanted to learn more about new technologies for the ICU and required more time for learning. Physicians had fewer reservations than nurses about AI-based intelligent alarm management and using mobile phones for remote monitoring. Conclusions: This survey study of ICU staff revealed key improvements for patient monitoring in intensive care medicine. Hospital providers and medical device manufacturers should focus on reducing false alarms, implementing hospital alarm standard operating procedures, introducing wireless sensors, preparing for the use of AI, and enhancing the digital literacy of ICU staff. Our results may contribute to the user-centered transfer of digital technologies into practice to alleviate challenges in intensive care medicine. © 2020 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

Consequently, a patient monitoring scheme intended for heart patients utilizing IoT centered Deep Learning Modified Neural Network (DLMNN) is proposed to assist in the HD diagnosis, and medication is given accordingly. This proposed technique is executed via '3' steps: I) Authentication, ii) Encryption, and iii) Classification. First, by utilizing the substitution cipher (SC) together with the SHA-512, the heart patient of the specific hospital is authenticated. Subsequently, the wearable IoT sensor device, which is fixed to the patient's body, concurrently transmits the sensor data to the cloud.

Regarding self‐monitoring, wearable activity trackers allow automated passive data collection that educate and motivate patients. Wearing an activity tracker can improve walking time by around 1500 steps per day. However, there are concerns about measurement accuracy (e.g., lack of a common validation protocol or measurement discrepancies between different devices). For external monitoring, many innovative electronic tools are currently used in rheumatology to help support physician time management, to reduce the burden on clinic time, and to prioritize patients who may need further attention. In inflammatory arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis, regular monitoring of patients to detect disease flares improves outcomes. In a pilot study applying machine learning to activity tracker steps, we showed that physical activity was strongly linked to disease flares and that patterns of physical activity could be used to predict flares with great accuracy, with a sensitivity and specificity above 95%. Thus, automatic monitoring of steps may lead to improved disease control through potential early identification of disease flares.

Needs, opportunities and challenges for the emerging fields of mobile health (mHealth, aka eHealth) and mobile rehabilitation (mRehab) are discussed. Healthcare in the United States (U.S.) is at a critical juncture characterized by: (1) a growing need for healthcare and rehabilitation services; (2) maturing technological capabilities to support more effective and efficient health services; (3) evolving public policies designed, by turns, to contain cost and support new models of care; and (4) a growing need to ensure acceptance and usability of new health technologies by people with disabilities and chronic conditions, clinicians and health delivery systems. Discussion of demographic and population health data, healthcare service delivery and a public policy primarily focuses on the U.S. However, trends identified (aging populations, growing prevalence of chronic conditions and disability, labor shortages in healthcare) apply to most countries with advanced economies and others. Furthermore, technologies that enable mRehab (wearable sensors, in-home environmental monitors, cloud computing, artificial intelligence) transcend national boundaries. Remote and mobile healthcare delivery is needed and inevitable. Proactive engagement is critical to ensure acceptance and effectiveness for all stakeholders. © 2020 by the authors.

Recently, wearable devices have become popular with wide applications in the health monitoring system which has stimulated the growth of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). The IoMT has an important role to play in reducing the mortality rate by the early detection of disease. The prediction of heart disease is a key issue in the analysis of clinical dataset. The aim of the proposed investigation is to identify the key characteristics of heart disease prediction using machine learning techniques. Many studies have focused on heart disease diagnosis, but the accuracy of the findings is low. Therefore, to improve prediction accuracy, an IoMT framework for the diagnosis of heart disease using modified salp swarm optimization (MSSO) and an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is proposed. The proposed MSSO-ANFIS improves the search capability using the Levy flight algorithm. The regular learning process in ANFIS is dependent on gradient-based learning and has a tendency to become trapped in local minima. The learning parameters are optimized utilizing MSSO to provide better results for ANFIS. The following information is taken from medical records to predict the risk of heart disease: blood pressure (BP), age, sex, chest pain, cholesterol, blood sugar, etc. The heart condition is identified by classifying the received sensor data using MSSO-ANFIS. A simulation and analysis is conducted to show that MSSA-ANFIS works well in relation to disease prediction. The results of the simulation demonstrate that the MSSO-ANFIS prediction model achieves better accuracy than the other approaches. The proposed MSSO-ANFIS prediction model obtains an accuracy of 99.45 with a precision of 96.54, which is higher than the other approaches. © 2013 IEEE."

Will this lead to increased value in healthcare? Are clinical outcomes going to improve alongside the delivery of better patient experiences? Will technology make the delivery of healthcare more sustainable? Despite most of us feeling like we could not work, live, or play without our mobile phones, they have only been in existence (as we know them today) for the last 20 years. However, the continuous advancement of technology and capability has affected healthcare and brought medicine, first into our homes and increasingly into our pockets. The future of telehealth fits into a consumer world that expects high quality, instant access, and personalized health propositions. As the demand for personalized medicine rises, more devices are released to capture vital signs, well-being metrics, and background data. In the clinical setting, this could allow real-time monitoring and preemptive doctor/patient interactions to prevent adverse incidents. At the very least, these developments offer the chance for richer and better-informed clinical decisions to be made based on longitudinal metrics. None of this is happening in isolation, and in fact some of the biggest companies in the world (e.g., Apple) have made their intent clear with devices such as watches which have engaged people to perform remote monitoring even when they are not “patients”. This combined with the increasing number of health apps (325, 000 in 2017) are changing the way people engage with their own health and interact with clinicians. It is expected that telehealth and wearable technology-allowing remote monitoring-will continue to play an increasingly significant role in almost all future healthcare delivery models from prevention to recovery and everything in-between. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, we introduce a transfer-learning based Long-term Recurrent Convolution Network (LRCN) named as 'MyoNet' for the classification of lower limb movements, along with the prediction of the corresponding knee joint angle. The model consists of three blocks- (i) feature extractor block, (ii) joint angle prediction block, and (iii) movement classification block. Initially, the model is end-to-end trained for knee joint angle prediction followed by transferring the knowledge of a trained model to the movement classification through transfer-learning approach making a memory and computationally efficient design. The proposed MyoNet was evaluated on publicly available University of California (UC) Irvine machine learning repository dataset of the lower limb for 11 healthy subjects and 11 subjects with knee pathology for three movements type-walking, standing with knee flexion movements and sitting with knee extension movements. The average mean absolute error (MAE) resulted in the prediction of joint angle for healthy subjects and subjects with knee pathology are 8.1 % and 9.2 % respectively. Subsequently, an average classification accuracy of 98.1 % and 92.4 % were achieved for healthy subjects and subjects with knee pathology, respectively. Interestingly, the significance of this study in itself is promising with substantial improvement in the performance compared to state-of-the-art methodologies.

The manufacturers of these devices provide proprietary software that labels the sensor data at specified time intervals with activity and sleep information. If the device wearer has a health condition affecting their movement, such as a stroke, these labels and their values can vary greatly from manufacturer to manufacturer. Consequently, generating outcome predictions based on data collected from patients attending inpatient rehabilitation wearing different sensor devices can be challenging, which hampers usefulness of these data for patient care decisions. In this article, we present a data-driven approach to combining datasets collected from different device manufacturers. With the ability to combine datasets, we merge data from three different device manufacturers to form a larger dataset of time series data collected from 44 patients receiving inpatient therapy services. To gain insights into the recovery process, we use this dataset to build models that predict a patient's next day physical activity duration and next night sleep duration. Using our data-driven approach and the combined dataset, we obtained a normalized root mean square error prediction of 9.11% for daytime physical activity and 11.18% for nighttime sleep duration. Our sleep result is comparable to the accuracy we achieved using the manufacturer's sleep labels (12.26%). Our device-independent predictions are suitable for both point-of-care and remote monitoring applications to provide information to clinicians for customizing therapy services and potentially decreasing recovery time.  © 2013 IEEE."

However, these measurements are often not as accurate or reliable as clinical evaluations because it is challenging to objectively distinguish the unique gait characteristics of PD. We explore the inference of patients' stage of PD from their gait using machine learning analyses of data gathered from their smartphone sensors. Specifically, we investigate supervised machine learning (ML) models to classify the severity of the motor part of the UPDRS (MDS-UPDRS 2.10-2.13). Our goals are to facilitate remote monitoring of PD patients and to answer the following questions: (1) What is the patient PD stage based on their gait? (2) Which features are best for understanding and classifying PD gait severities? (3) Which ML classifier types best discriminate PD patients from healthy controls (HC)? and (4) Which ML classifier types can discriminate the severity of PD gait anomalies? Methodology: Our work uses smartphone sensor data gathered from 9520 patients in the mPower study, of whom 3101 participants uploaded gait recordings and 344 subjects and 471 controls uploaded at least 3 walking activities. We selected 152 PD patients who performed at least 3 recordings before and 3 recordings after taking medications and 304 HC who performed at least 3 walking recordings. From the accelerometer and gyroscope sensor data, we extracted statistical, time, wavelet and frequency domain features, and other lifestyle features were derived directly from participants' survey data. We conducted supervised classification experiments using 10-fold cross-validation and measured the model precision, accuracy, and area under the curve (AUC). Results: The best classification model, best feature, highest classification accuracy, and AUC were (1) random forest and entropy rate, 93% and 0.97, respectively, for walking balance (MDS-UPDRS-2.12); (2) bagged trees and MinMaxDiff, 95% and 0.92, respectively, for shaking/tremor (MDS-UPDRS-2.10); (3) bagged trees and entropy rate, 98% and 0.98, respectively, for freeze of gait; and (4) random forest and MinMaxDiff, 95% and 0.99, respectively, for distinguishing PD patients from HC. Conclusion: Machine learning classification was challenging due to the use of data that were subjectively labeled based on patients' answers to the MDS-UPDRS survey questions. However, with use of a significantly larger number of subjects than in prior work and clinically validated gait features, we were able to demonstrate that automatic patient classification based on smartphone sensor data can be used to objectively infer the severity of PD and the extent of specific gait anomalies. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd."

The objective of this study was to determine the accuracy of noninvasive remote monitoring in predicting HF rehospitalization. Methods: The LINK-HF study (Multisensor Non-invasive Remote Monitoring for Prediction of Heart Failure Exacerbation) examined the performance of a personalized analytical platform using continuous data streams to predict rehospitalization after HF admission. Study subjects were monitored for up to 3 months using a disposable multisensor patch placed on the chest that recorded physiological data. Data were uploaded continuously via smartphone to a cloud analytics platform. Machine learning was used to design a prognostic algorithm to detect HF exacerbation. Clinical events were formally adjudicated. Results: One hundred subjects aged 68.4±10.2 years (98% male) were enrolled. After discharge, the analytical platform derived a personalized baseline model of expected physiological values. Differences between baseline model estimated vital signs and actual monitored values were used to trigger a clinical alert. There were 35 unplanned nontrauma hospitalization events, including 24 worsening HF events. The platform was able to detect precursors of hospitalization for HF exacerbation with 76% to 88% sensitivity and 85% specificity. Median time between initial alert and readmission was 6.5 (4.2-13.7) days.

Thanks to major advances in information technology and communication, telemedicine (remote medical practice), appears as a promising solution for the improvement of its care. Since ten years, France approved five telemedicine procedures, including telemonitoring, which has been extensively studied for heart failure. It enables the detection early signs of cardiac decompensation and thus, through therapeutic adaptation, avoid hospital readmission. The monitoring of multiple physiological parameters, invasive and non-invasive, is currently possible thanks to many tools (structured telephone support, standalone devices, cardiac implantable devices for therapeutic or diagnostic purposes) with continuous innovations (e.g. wearable devices). Although the result of dozens of randomized clinical trials is divergent (due in particular to the complexity of telemonitoring and the heterogeneity of the techniques used), the different meta-analyzes show a medical and economic benefit of remote monitoring. That is why, pending the results of studies in progress, particularly in France, our country has set up for the first time a real-life experience (ETAPES program).

Data mining techniques efficiently preprocess the healthcare data and reduce the dimensionality of the data. The proposed ontologies provide semantic knowledge about entities and aspects, and their relations in the domains of diabetes and blood pressure (BP). Bi-LSTM correctly classifies the healthcare data to predict drug side effects and abnormal conditions in patients. Also, the proposed system classifies the patients’ health condition using their healthcare data related to diabetes, BP, mental health, and drug reviews. This framework is developed employing the Protégé Web Ontology Language tool with Java. The results show that the proposed model precisely handles heterogeneous data and improves the accuracy of health condition classification and drug side effect predictions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V."
2020,IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine,10.1109/JTEHM.2019.2955947,"Suresh, S.; Duerstock, B.S.",Automated detection of symptomatic autonomic dysreflexia through multimodal sensing,,"Objective: Autonomic Dysreflexia (AD) is a potentially life-threatening syndrome which occurs in individuals with higher level spinal cord injuries (SCI). AD is caused by triggers which can lead to rapid escalation of pathophysiological responses and if the trigger is not removed, AD can be fatal. There is currently no objective, non-invasive and accurate monitoring system available to automatically detect the onset of AD symptoms in real time in a non-clinical setting. Technology or Method: We developed a user-independent method of symptomatic AD detection in real time with a wearable physiological telemetry system (PTS) and a machine learning model using data from eleven participants with SCI. Results: The PTS could detect onset of AD symptoms with an average accuracy of 94.10% and a false negative rate of 4.89%. Conclusions: The PTS can detect the onset of the symptoms AD with high sensitivity and specificity to assist people with SCIs in preventing the occurrence of AD. It would enable persons with high level SCIs to be more independent and pursue vocational activities while granting continuous medical oversight. Clinical Impact: The PTS could serve as a supplementary tool to current solutions to detect the onset of AD and prepare individuals who are newly injured to be better prepared for AD episodes. Moreover, it could be translated into a system to encourage individuals to practice better healthcare management to prevent future occurrences. © 2013 IEEE."
