The use of glycerol as a carbon source for 2,3-BDO production in Klebsiella pneumoniae has been limited, since 1,3-propanediol (PDO) is generated during glycerol fermentation. Results: In this study, the inactivation of the budC gene in K. pneumoniae increased the production rate of (R,R)-2,3-BDO from 21.92 ± 2.10 to 92.05 ± 1.20%. The major isomer form of K. pneumoniae (meso-2,3-BDO) was shifted to (R,R)-2,3-BDO. The purity of (R,R)-2,3-BDO was examined by agitation speed, and 98.54% of (R,R)-2,3-BDO was obtained at 500 rpm. However, as the cultivation period got longer, the purity of (R,R)-2,3-BDO declined. For this problem, a two-step agitation speed control strategy (adjusted from 500 to 400 rpm after 24 h) and over-expression of the dhaD gene involved in (R,R)-2,3-BDO biosynthesis were used. Nevertheless, the purity of (R,R)-2,3-BDO still gradually decreased over time. Finally, when pure glycerol was replaced with crude glycerol, the titer of 89.47 g/L of (R,R)-2,3-BDO (1.69 g/L of meso-2,3-BDO), productivity of 1.24 g/L/h, and yield of 0.35 g/g consumed crude glycerol was achieved while maintaining a purity of 98% or higher. Conclusions: This study is meaningful in that it demonstrated the highest production and productivity among studies in that produced (R,R)-2,3-BDO with a high purity in Klebsiella sp. strains. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to produce (R,R)-2,3-BDO using glycerol as the sole carbon source."

Little is known about the acceptability and sustainability of integrating wearables into routine care from the perspectives of people with CF (pwCF) and their treating clinicians. Methods: A cross-sectional qualitative study involving semi-structured interviews with adult pwCF and focus groups comprising members of a CF multidisciplinary team (MDT) were conducted at a specialist CF centre in Australia. A phenomenological orientation underpinned the study. Inductive thematic analysis was performed using the Framework method. The study adhered to the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) checklist. Results: Nine pwCF and eight members of a CF MDT, representing six clinical disciplines, participated in the study. Eight themes were inductively generated from the data, of which four were identified from each group. PwCF valued wearables for providing real-time data to motivate healthy behaviours and support shared goal-setting with healthcare providers. Wearables did not influence adherence to CF-specific self-management practices and had some hardware limitations. Members of the CF MDT recognised potential benefits of remote monitoring and shared goal-setting, but advised caution regarding data accuracy, generating patient anxiety in certain personality traits, and lack of evidence supporting use in CF self-management. Conclusions: Perspectives on integrating wearables into CF care were cautiously optimistic, with emerging risks related to patient anxiety and lack of evidence moderating acceptance."

Smaller children supported with LVADs typically remain hospitalized for months awaiting heart transplant—a major burden for families and a challenge for hospitals. We describe the initial outcomes of the Jarvik 2015, a miniaturized implantable continuous flow LVAD, in the NHLBI-funded Pumps for Kids, Infants, and Neonates (PumpKIN) study, for bridge-to-heart transplant. Methods: Children weighing 8 to 30 kg with severe systolic heart failure and failing optimal medical therapy were recruited at 7 centers in the United States. Patients with severe right heart failure and single-ventricle congenital heart disease were excluded. The primary feasibility endpoint was survival to 30 days without severe stroke or non-operational device failure. Results: Of 7 children implanted, the median age was 2.2 (range 0.7, 7.1) years, median weight 10 (8.2 to 20.7) kilograms; 86% had dilated cardiomyopathy; 29% were INTERMACS profile 1. The median duration of Jarvik 2015 support was 149 (range 5 to 188) days where all 7 children survived including 5 to heart transplant, 1 to recovery, and 1 to conversion to a paracorporeal device. One patient experienced an ischemic stroke on day 53 of device support in the setting of myocardial recovery. One patient required ECMO support for intractable ventricular arrhythmias and was eventually transplanted from paracorporeal biventricular VAD support. The median pump speed was 1600 RPM with power ranging from 1–4 Watts. The median plasma free hemoglobin was 19, 30, 19 and 30 mg/dL at 7, 30, 90 and 180 days or time of explant, respectively. All patients reached the primary feasibility endpoint. Patient-reported outcomes with the device were favorable with respect to participation in a full range of activities. Due to financial issues with the manufacturer, the study was suspended after consent of the eighth patient. Conclusion: The Jarvik 2015 LVAD appears to hold important promise as an implantable continuous flow device for smaller children that may support hospital discharge. The FDA has approved the device to proceed to a 22-subject pivotal trial. Whether this device will survive to commercialization remains unclear because of the financial challenges faced by industry seeking to develop pediatric medical devices.

The extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) were identified by thin-layer chromatography and infrared spectroscopy. The fermentation conditions were optimized by single factor experiments in shake flasks and a 5-L fermentor. The results of morphological and phylogenetic tree analysis showed that RM1603 was a strain of Aureobasidium pullulans. Its microbial polysaccharide was identified as pullulan, and the EPS production capacity reached 33.07 ± 1.03 g L−1 in shake flasks. The fermentation conditions were optimized in a 5-L fermentor, and were found to encompass an initial pH of 6.5, aeration rate of 2 vvm, rotor speed of 600 rpm, and inoculum size of 2 %. Under these conditions, the pullulan yield of RM1603 reached 62.52 ± 0.24 g L−1. Thus, this study contributes RM1603 as a new isolation with high-yielding pullulan and potential application value in biotechnology."

S. cohnii L1-N1 exhibited a reduction of 24.4 % in Cr6+ and an adsorption rate of 6.43 % for Cd over a period of 5 days. These results were achieved under optimal conditions of pH (7.0), temperature (35 °C), shaking speed (200 rpm), and inoculum volume (8 %). B. cereus strain CKN12 exhibited complete reduction of Cr6+ within a span of 48 h, while it demonstrated a 57.3 % adsorption capacity for Cd over a period of 120 h. These results were achieved under conditions of optimal pH (8.0), temperature (40 °C), shaking speed (150 rpm), and inoculum volume (2–3 %). Additionally, microcharacterization and ICP-MS analysis revealed that Cr and Cd were accumulated on the cell surface, whereas Cr6+ was mainly reduced extracellularly. Subsequently, a series of pot experiments were conducted to provide evidence that the inclusion of S. cohnii L1-N1 or B. cereus CKN12 into the system resulted in a notable enhancement in both the plant height and biomass of king grass. In particular, it was observed that the presence of S. cohnii L1-N1 or B. cereus CKN12 in king grass led to a significant reduction in the levels of Cd and Cr in the soils (36.0 % and 27.8 %, or 72.9 % and 47.4 %, respectively). Thus, the results of this study indicate that the combined use of two bacterial strains can effectively aid in the remediation of tropical soils contaminated with moderate to light levels of Cd and Cr."

The proposed dielectric layer with uniformly distributed interior microporous can not only increase its compressibility and dynamic response within an extended pressure range but also enlarge its contact area with electrodes, contributing to a simultaneous improvement in the sensitivity, response speed, detection range, and structure robustness. Meanwhile, owing to its superior abilities in complex structure manufacturing and dimension controlling, the proposed 3D-printing-based fabrication process enables the consistent fabrication of the porous microstructure and thus guarantees device consistency. As a result, the prepared pressure sensors exhibit a high sensitivity of 0.21 kPa-1, fast response and relaxation times of 112 and 152 ms, an interface bonding strength of more than 455.2 kPa, and excellent performance consistency (≤5.47% deviation among different batches of sensors) and tunability. Encouraged by this, the pressure sensor is further integrated with a wireless readout circuit and realizes wireless wearable monitoring of various biosignals (pulse waves and heart rate) and body movements (from slight finger touch to large knee bending). Finally, the influence law of the feature parameters of the porous microstructure on device performance is established by the finite element method, paving the way for sensor optimization. This study motivates the development of flexible capacitive pressure sensors toward practical application."

Various approaches can be used to monitor BP: in the office/clinic; at home; 24-h ambulatory recording; or with wearable and cuffless devices. Of these, home BP monitoring is a reliable and convenient method, and is recommended for hypertension management by current national and international guidelines. This recommendation is based on evidence showing that home BP is an important predictor of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and kidney disease in patients with hypertension. In addition, lifetime personalized health record (PHR)-based home BP with telemonitoring combined with co-interventions has been shown to lower BP more effectively than the traditional approach based on office BP. Thus, home BP represents a key metric for personalized anticipation medicine, from digital healthcare to digital medicine. This paper summarizes the latest evidence on home BP monitoring and proposes a Hypertension Cardiovascular Outcome Prevention and Evidence in Asia (HOPE Asia) Network consensus on a home BP-centered approach to the management of hypertension.

This can, in turn, reduce the burden on healthcare resources. The timely integration of DHTs into health systems relies on Accelerated Coverage Pathways for Innovation (ACPIs) which facilitate early access to these innovative solutions. This research aims to compare the various ACPIs for DHT coverage in Germany, France, and the United Kingdom. Methods: All publicly available documents on regulations, guidelines, and evaluation processes of the ACPIs in the three countries up to 2023 were identified and used to map available details of the programs. A theoretical evaluation using publicly available ACPI criteria was conducted to compare the likelihood of coverage of two technologies, used as case studies. This was done to comprehend the factors that may influence the adoption of DHT in respective countries. Results: The most appropriate DHT ACPIs were identified; one per country in scope: the AI in Health and Care award in the UK, DiGA in Germany, and PECAN Coverage in France. The pathways were compared to detect similarities and differences in coverage criteria. The theoretical evaluation resulted in 100% of the devices being eligible in the UK, 50% in Germany and 50% in France. (Theoretical evaluations were based on public information but actual authority evaluations could differ.) Conclusions: Innovative pathways for DHT adoption in the three countries all aim to expedite the delivery of life-saving, revolutionary technology. Our study showed that Germany has a smaller acceptance of the type of technologies they cover (risk class I & IIa) and strict evidence and technical requirements. Though France has a wider acceptance (Risk class I-III & remote patient monitoring devices), it only covers CE-marked digital devices. UK’s ACPI aims to support various devices through different lifecycle stages and differing levels of evidence generation."

This requires frequent hospital visits which are often a challenge especially when travelling to hospitals imposes significant costs for the patient. Furthermore, structured data acquisition in the home care setting is missing. Methods: We have developed a fully patient centered, easy to operate mobile phone application for aHSCT patients that allows for treatment specific symptom reporting. In combination with a wearable device (smart watch), a blood pressure monitor and a thermometer, this application incorporates online monitoring of all major vital signs in almost real time. The application currently captures more than 50 static and dynamic metrics relevant for aSCT and provides a photo function to capture skin images in a patient specific image library. Daily symptom reporting can be performed as often as necessary and data from wearable devices are obtained in very high frequency. Symptom reporting includes information on general wellbeing, nausea, oral mucositis, bowel movement frequency and consistency, information on oral calorie and fluid uptake, and it captures and calculates body surface areas affected by rash. All data are streamed in almost real time and displayed on a browser-based dashboard to the healthcare team. The user interface for the physician dashboard was developed using the React JavaScript library whereas the mobile application utilized React Native to enable Android and iOS applications. The collection, storage, and presentation of patient data via the physician dashboard is facilitated using various AWS technologies such as Lambda, S3 and Timestream. Data can be stored according to federal laws and regulations the software is operating in. Access to the dashboard is center-specific and secured by a dual verification process. Summary: Daily symptom reporting by the patient is easy, comprehensive and can be completed within minutes. Data from wearable devices are obtained 24/7 at high frequency. All data are displayed on a dashboard to the corresponding physician with only a few minutes delay. The system captures vital signs (blood pressure, temperature, pulse, breathing rate, oxygen saturation, etc.) and GvHD related symptoms such as skin rash including body surface area affected, and frequency/volume of bowel movements. It provides information based on the patient's physical activity, food intake, fluid intake, sleeping patterns in a structured fashion. The physician's dashboard displays all transplant relevant static information like HLA match, conditioning regimen, type of immunosuppression, ABO incompatibility, serologies of patient and donor. It displays all data reported longitudinally and allows physicians to observe trends and developments providing interactive graphs on each metrics. It provides a medication plan that captures daily dosage, duration of treatment and calculates cumulative doses. Changes in medication and dosing will alert the patient on the mobile phone application. All data can be obtained in a structured fashion for research purposes by the participating institution. Conclusion: This mobile phone application in combination with a wearable device allows for remote monitoring of patients after aHSCT. Its function is comprehensive and not only provides structured data, but allows for monitoring success of medical treatment. It is developed in a modular fashion that can be easily adapted to specific requirements in other cell therapies such CAR CD19, AML induction therapies or autologous SCT."

Key contributors to this problem are clinical inertia and uncertainties in relying on clinic blood pressure measurements to make treatment decisions. Methods: The NEXTGEN-BP open-label, multicenter, randomized controlled trial will investigate the efficacy, safety, acceptability and cost-effectiveness of a wearable blood pressure monitor-based care strategy for the treatment of hypertension, compared to usual care, in lowering clinic blood pressure over 12 months. NEXTGEN-BP will enroll 600 adults with high blood pressure, treated with 0 to 2 antihypertensive medications. Participants attending primary care practices in Australia will be randomized 1:1 to the intervention of a wearable-based remote care strategy or to usual care. Participants in the intervention arm will undergo continuous blood pressure monitoring using a wrist-wearable cuffless device (Aktiia, Switzerland) and participate in 2 telehealth consultations with their primary care practitioner (general practitioner [GP]) at months 1 and 2. Antihypertensive medication will be up-titrated by the primary care practitioner at the time of telehealth consults should the percentage of daytime blood pressure at target over the past week be <90%, if clinically tolerated. Participants in the usual care arm will have primary care consultations according to usual practice. The primary outcome is the difference between intervention and control in change in clinic systolic blood pressure from baseline to 12 months. Secondary outcomes will be assessed at month 3 and month 12, and include acceptability to patients and practitioners, cost-effectiveness, safety, medication adherence and patient engagement.

However, in situ regulation of the mechanical properties of hydrogels is still a challenge, and regular conductive hydrogels will inevitably freeze at subzero temperature and easily dehydrate, which leads to a short service life. Herein, a novel adhesive hydrogel (PAA-Dopa-Zr4+) capable of strain sensing is proposed with antifreezing, nondrying, strong surface adhesion, and tunable mechanical properties. 3,4-Dihydroxyphenyl-l-alanine (l-Dopa)-grafted poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and Zr4+ ion are introduced into the hydrogel, which broadly alters the mechanical properties via tuning the in situ aggregation state of polymer chains by ions based on the complexation effect. The catechol groups of l-Dopa and viscous glucose endow the hydrogel with high adhesiveness for skin and device interface (including humid and dry environments) and exhibit an outstanding temperature tolerance under extreme wide temperature spectrum (-35 to 65 °C) or long-lasting moisture retention (60 days). Furthermore, this PAA-Dopa-Zr4+ can be assembled as a flexible strain-sensitive sensor to detect human motions based on specific mechanical properties requirements. This work, enabling superior adhesive and temperature tolerance performance and broad mechanical tenability, presents a new paradigm for numerous applications to wearable sensing and personalized healthcare monitoring."

Gross necropsy and histopathologic findings from all birds resulted in a diagnosis of round cell neoplasia in multiple organs, including the skin, liver, kidney, and reproductive tract, with intranuclear inclusion bodies in the neoplastic cells. In all 4 cases, immunohistochemical staining showed strong immunoreactivity for CD3 in 70% to 80% of the neoplastic round cells, with a relatively small subset that were immunopositive for Pax5.

Currently, there are no biometric or circulating biomarkers to assess hydrocortisone replacement adequacy. Dosing is based on symptomatology, often resulting in over- or undertreatment. Methods: We used remote monitoring precision health solutions to identify AI molecular and biometric biomarkers over 2 weeks. Using remote sampling devices (Mitra Neoteryx), 10-μL dried blood samples were collected weekly for protein analysis by AI subjects before and 5 hours after daily hydrocortisone doses and age- and sex matched adrenal sufficient (AS) subjects at approximately the same times. Continuous physical activity were measured with a wearable biosensor (Fitbit Charge HR) along with remote systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure and heart rate (HR) (Omron Evolv). Self-reported AddiQoL questionnaires were completed twice daily. For biometric endpoints and questionnaires, data are summarized as mean ± SD using two-sided t-tests, where a p value<0.05 is considered statistically significant. For proteomic analysis, median value was calculated, and statistical testing identified differentially expressed proteins (DEPs; FDR<5%). Results:Fifteen AI (6 primary AI [PAI] and 9 secondary AI [SAI] and 15 AS subjects completed the study. AI group mean age was 46.3±15.7 and AS was 41.7±13.2. In both groups, 80% were female. Adherence to home monitoring was 100% in AI subjects and >90% in AS (13/15 assessable for biometrics (activity and BP) and 14/15 for AddiQoL). SBP was lower in PAI (106.2±7.9/68.3±7.6 [n=5]) vs SAI (119.1±15.3/71.1±8.9 [n=8]; p=0.04). Nighttime BP (22:00-05:00) for both PAI (102.3±7.8/68.5 ±7.9) and SAI (101.2±8.2/63.8±9) were significantly lower than AS (115.5±15.6; p=0.04 and p=0.02, respectively). AI heart rate was lower vs AS at night (61.4±11.6 [n=13] vs 72.5±11.1 [n=11]; p=0.01), especially in PAI (57.7±5 [n=5]; p=0.001). Average daily activity was higher in AS than AI as measured by steps (9010 vs 7787; p=0.02), miles (3.94 vs 3.36; p=0.03) and stair flights (14.19 vs 9.85; p=0.01). On AddiQoL, AI subjects scored lower than AS subjects (126.8 ±18.1 vs 143.3±14.9, respectively; p<0.0001). Across all dried blood samples, 444 proteins were quantified. Comparing AI vs AS, 78 were identified before morning hydrocortisone dose vs 88 before afternoon dose. Forty-nine DEPs were commonly identified and showed the same regulation trends. Nine DEPs before and 18 DEPs after morning and afternoon dosing, respectively, were identified in AI. None of these DEPs were common, indicating potential blood proteome signature changes in the morning and in the afternoon.

However, the general conductive fibers, a major component of the existing wearable monitoring systems, have a positive gauge-factor (GF) that increases electrical resistance when stretched, so that the systems have no choice but to consume power continuously. Herein, a twisted conductive-fiber-based negatively responsive switch-type (NRS) strain-sensor with an extremely high negative GF (resistance change ratio ≈ 3.9 × 108 ) that can significantly increase its conductivity from insulating to conducting properties is developed. To this end, a precision cracking technology is devised, which could induce a difference in the Young's modulus of the encapsulated layer on the fiber through selective ultraviolet-irradiation treatment. Owing to this technology, the NRS strain-sensors can allow for effective regulation of the mutual contact resistance under tensile strain while maintaining superior durability for over 5000 stretching cycles.

RESULTS: In this study, aerobic conditions at 300 rpm agitation and 1 vvm aeration with two Rushton turbine impellers (kLa = 33.6 h−1) and the concentration of coenzyme B12 at 7.5 μmol L−1 were identified as the best optimized conditions to improve 1,3-PDO production by the strain. With a two-pulsed continuous feeding, E. coli NSK015 produced 1,3-PDO up to 60.3 g L−1 with the 1,3-PDO yield approaching a theoretical maximum of 0.97 g g−1 and productivity of 0.42 g L−1 h−1 in fed-batch fermentation, in which concentration was improved about 60% compared to that of batch fermentation. CONCLUSION: The result indicated the efficiency of E. coli NSK015 in producing 1,3-PDO under optimal aerobic conditions. The strain could even enhance growth and maintain enzymatic activities involved in the 1,3-PDO pathway without utilizing antibiotics, isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) or enriching nutrients. Plasmid instability, high production cost related to medium preparation and purification, and waste disposal were not of concern. This may provide a new insight for large-scale 1,3-PDO production by E. coli NSK015. Additionally, E. coli NSK015 could be a microbial host model for further developing new 1,3-PDO-producing microorganisms regardless of plasmid, inducer, antibiotics and rich nutrients in fermentation medium. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry (SCI)."

This study conducted an overview on the opportunities, the perspectives, and the problems related to the integration of TD with AI. The methodology of this review, following a standardized checklist, was based on: (I) a search of PubMed and Scopus and (II) an eligibility assessment, using parameters with five levels of score. The outcome highlighted that applications of this integration have been identified in various skin pathologies and in quality control, both in eHealth and mHealth. Many of these applications are based on Apps used by citizens in mHealth for self-care with new opportunities but also open questions. A generalized enthusiasm has been registered regarding the opportunities and general perspectives on improving the quality of care, optimizing the healthcare processes, minimizing costs, reducing the stress in the healthcare facilities, and in making citizens, now at the center, more satisfied. However, critical issues have emerged related to: (a) the need to improve the process of diffusion of the Apps in the hands of citizens, with better design, validation, standardization, and cybersecurity; (b) the need for better attention paid to medico-legal and ethical issues; and (c) the need for the stabilization of international and national regulations.

Today, the direct-to-consumer marketing of devices create a new context allowing an algorithmic processing of information for remote decision-making either by the patient or by a healthcare professional. The home BP telemonitoring (HBPT) is the remote transmission of BP values, measured at home and transmitted to the doctor’s office or hospital, by means of telehealth strategies. In this context, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) studies have demonstrated HBPT ability in improving patients’ compliance and adherence to treatment and in accomplishing better hypertension control rates. The level of evidence for the drop in BP is “moderate” and the place of HBPT is not clearly established in current practice. Digital interventions have the potential to support patient in self-management. This approach presupposes the prior acquisition of skills, the level of which must be adapted to the level of health literacy of each patient.

Such a traditional assessment framework may lack consideration of individual characteristics when evaluating training on complex tasks, such as driving and piloting, where operators are typically required to execute multiple tasks simultaneously. Studies have already identified individual characteristics arising from intrinsic, context, strategy, personality, and preference as common predictors of performance and mental load. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effect of individual difference in skill acquisition and transfer using an ecologically valid dual task, behavioral, and brain activity measures. Specifically, we implemented a search and surveillance task (scanning and identifying targets) using a high-fidelity training simulator for the unmanned aircraft sensor operator, acquired behavioral measures (scan, not scan, over scan, and adaptive target find scores) using simulator-based analysis module, and measured brain activity changes (oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin) from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) using a portable functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) sensor array. The experimental protocol recruited 13 novice participants and had them undergo three easy and two hard sessions to investigate skill acquisition and transfer, respectively. Our results from skill acquisition sessions indicated that performance on both tasks did not change when individual differences were not accounted for. However inclusion of individual differences indicated that some individuals improved only their scan performance (Attention-focused group), while others improved only their target find performance (Accuracy-focused group). Brain activity changes during skill acquisition sessions showed that mental load decreased in the right anterior medial PFC (RAMPFC) in both groups regardless of individual differences. However, mental load increased in the left anterior medial PFC (LAMPFC) of Attention-focused group and decreased in the Accuracy-focused group only when individual differences were included. Transfer results showed no changes in performance regardless of grouping based on individual differences; however, mental load increased in RAMPFC of Attention-focused group and left dorsolateral PFC (LDLPFC) of Accuracy-focused group. Efficiency and involvement results suggest that the Attention-focused group prioritized the scan task, while the Accuracy-focused group prioritized the target find task. In conclusion, training on multitasks results in individual differences. These differences may potentially be due to individual preference. Future studies should incorporate individual differences while assessing skill acquisition and transfer during multitask training."

With a growing body of supportive clinical studies, advances in digital inhaler sensors and platforms, greater support from payers and healthcare organizations, significant growth with these technologies is expected. While all digital (smart) inhalers record adherence, these are distinguished by their compatibility with commercial inhalers, capabilities to guide inhaler technique, use of patient-reported outcomes, and user-friendliness for both the healthcare professional (HCP) and patient. Due to the complexity and novelty of employing digital inhalers, collaboration with multiple entities within health systems is necessary and a well-planned integration is needed. For HCPs and patients, cybersecurity and privacy are critical, it will require review by each healthcare organization. In the US, some payers reimburse for remote monitoring using digital inhalers, but reimbursement is currently unavailable in other countries. There are several models for remote patient care, as employing an active, ongoing digital interface between the HCP and patient or they may choose to only review data at clinical encounters. Personalization of therapies and feedback are key to success. While digital inhaler malfunction uncommonly occurs, patient attrition over a year is significant. Some patients will be challenged to use digital platforms or have the necessary technology. Additional research is needed to address cost-effectiveness, in vivo accuracy of inspiratory measurement capable devices, ability to teach inhaler technique, their application for monitoring lung function, and lastly real-world adoption and implementation in routine clinical practice."

In addition, global control rates for hypertension remain poor: 23% for women and 18% for men in 2019 (Lancet. 2021:957). Measures to reduce the number of poorly controlled hypertensive patients are urgently needed. Remarkable advances in healthcare technology have changed healthcare delivery dramatically in the last decade with out-of-office blood pressure (BP) telemonitoring being widely used in clinical research (Hypertension. 2020:1368). We have demonstrated the efficacy of BP telemonitoring and digital intervention for the management of hypertension in the Telemonitoring And Self-Management IN the control of Hypertension (TASMINH) trials (Lancet. 2010:163, JAMA. 2014:799, Lancet. 2018:949), the Home and Online Management and Evaluation of Blood Pressure (HOME BP) trial (BMJ. 2021:m4858), and the HERB Digital Hypertension 1(HERB-DH1) pivotal trial (Eur Heart J. 2021:4111). A recent meta-analysis found that home BP telemonitoring improved office systolic BP (SBP) by 3.99 mmHg and home BP telemonitoring plus additional support (e.g., counselling and medications management) also showed a reduction of office SBP by 2.44 mmHg versus home BP telemonitoring alone (J Hum Hypertens. 2017:427). This evidence suggests that BP telemonitoring is an optimal tool for reducing BP levels and that combining BP telemonitoring and co-interventions would be the most effective approach for the management of hypertension. There are additional benefits from BP telemonitoring system in clinical practice, including assessment of accurate and reliable out-of-office BP data, and ease of BP measurement and recording by patients without the need for manual systems. Furthermore, such systems can reduce nonadherence of antihypertensive medications and clinical inertia, both of which contribute to a treatment-resistant hypertension (J Hypertens. 2017:2346, J Hypertens. 2021:1238). In practical terms, telemonitoring also facilitates optimal BP management for patients living in geographically remote or poorly medically resourced areas (Hypertension. 2021:1927). In this session, through discussion of the evidence base and clinical experience in the UK and Japan, we will examine the prospects of BP telemonitoring systems for the future management of hypertension. We will examine how BP telemonitoring systems are used and affect BP control in both clinical trials and subsequent implementation. In addition, by comparing such work in the UK and Japan, we will assess the potential of BP telemonitoring systems as a solution to the inadequate BP control status worldwide."

Results: The survey had 216 responses. 56% of nurses reported time savings, and <4% experienced additional time requirements due to the Monidor solution. On average, the Monidor solution was estimated to avoid 2.06 routine patient room visits, detect end of infusion 1.34 times, and free 5.05 minutes per nurse shift. One routine room visit avoided was associated with 2.45 minutes of freed time in the regression analysis.

The research found progress made via telemedicine in monitoring and conducting minor decisions (like up-titrating the doses of different medication regimens) in patients with several cardiovascular diseases (heart failure, atrial fibrillation, high blood pressure), as there is a worldwide trend to develop new telemonitoring biosensors and devices based on implantable delivered transcatheter. The worldwide telemedicine trend encourages a switch from small and hesitating steps to a more consistent assessment of the patients, based on high technology and Interventional Cardiology. Cardiovascular telemedicine, although made a sustainable effort in managing patients' health, has many obstacles to overcome before meeting all their needs. Data security, confidentiality and reimbursement are the top priorities in developing remote Cardiology. The regulatory institutions need to play an integrative role in leading the way for defining the framework of future telemedicine activities. The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak with all its tragedy served to reinforce the message that telemedicine services can be life-saving for cardiovascular patients. Once the Covid-19 era will fade away, telemedicine is likely to remain a complementary service of standard care.

International regulations prohibit the sale of sperm whale spermaceti, so it is now being replaced by pure cetyl palmitate obtained by a chemical route or from mixtures based on jojoba oil. Another alternative is to use an enzymatic route for wax ester synthesis. For such a purpose, a new heterogeneous biocatalyst was prepared by our research group via physical adsorption of Burkholderia cepacia lipase on aerogel modified with a protic ionic liquid (IB-IL-OPT). Its catalytic activity was compared with that of a biocatalyst prepared using a non-chemically modified silica aerogel (IB-Control). The objective of this work was to apply this homemade heterogeneous biocatalyst to cetyl palmitate synthesis via a direct esterification reaction in a solvent system and to test the final product as a stabilizing agent in water-in-oil emulsions. RESULTS: IB-IL-OPT achieved maximum acid conversion of 95–100% under optimal experimental conditions established using a central composite rotational design: biocatalyst concentration of 14.8% (w/w), molar ratio of 1:1.3, 41 °C for 15 h of reaction under continuous mechanical agitation (200 rpm). The IB-Control gave 58.8% acid conversion in similar conditions. IB-IL-OPT was successively reused for four cycles. The wax ester showed potential as a good emulsifier for virgin coconut oil.

The increased prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) combined with the complexity of their treatment, reinforces the need for effective and feasible educational programs for public health services. We evaluate the clinical impact of an educational program via mobile phone on metabolic control of individuals with T2DM. Methods: This study was an open-label, parallel-group trial, involving patients diagnosed with T2DM regularly seen at the Family Health Clinic, in Rio de Janeiro/Brazil. Ethical approval for this study was granted by the SecretariaMunicipal de Sańde do Rio de Janeiro Ethics Committee. Patients with diabetes were randomly allocated into 2 groups: intervention group (received a backpack containing health care devices and a mobile phone for remote monitoring provided with educational material for diabetes) or control group (standard of care). All outcome measures were collected at baseline and after a 3- month period. Changes in HbA1c were compared between groups using the modified Wald test. Results: a total of 360 patients completed the study (174intervention, 183 control group). The study included 65% of women, who were a mean (SD) age of 64,28 (11,38). There was a significant decrease in weight (p < 0.05), waist circumference (p < 0.01), Body Mass Index (p < 0.01), and glycated hemoglobin (p < 0.01) when comparing before and after the intervention. Conclusions: Mobile phone apps are an effective component to help glycemic control and could be considered an affordable and widely available adjuvant intervention to the standard selfmanagement for patients with T2DM."

2022,Circulation,10.1161/circ.145.suppl_1.P043,"Danawi, H.; Dunn, P.",A Framework for the Evaluation of Digital Tools,English,"Digital health tools encompass a wide range of technologies that have been used in healthcare services including mobile applications, health information technology, smart wearable devices, remote monitoring and treatment, and health platforms. These tools walk a fine line between lifestyle consumer products and medical devices. Sleep applications can be used by consumers as a fun gadget to track sleep, but it may also be used as a medical tool to collect information concerning serious sleep disorders. The fast proliferation of these tools has put pressure on concerned stakeholders to make sense of this group of technologies. Various questions have been raised within this realm: What counts as medical as opposed to a lifestyle device? Which devices require regulation and under what standards? Which devices are allowed to be used in the medical context? And which are not? And under what conditions? Social scientists have highlighted the complexity of digital health tools that (include both medical and lifestyle characteristics and the difficulties accompanied with classifying these tools for regulatory purposes. In an attempt to do so, several regulatory bodies including the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have revised their existing standards to accommodate the regulation of digital health tools. As such, the FDA published a guidance document on Mobile Medical Applications; this led to various concerns questioning the boundaries between lifestyle and medical digital technologies that were defined by the FDA guidelines, which left a significant number of technologies that were considered to be low-risk, completely out of the FDA oversight and with no required compliance/quality control/effectiveness checks. This prompted many companies to develop hundreds of products that belong to the low-risk category, granting them the ability to ignore FDA regulations. Consequently, there remains considerable concern regarding the quality and safety of these digital health technologies that are being used within the medical context. Clear and well-defined regulation processes are needed to control the development and design of these tools, especially that many lack scientific evidence and data privacy. The framework ought to include a risk-based approach to classify devices for regulation in a way to ensure the safety and effectiveness of all digital health tools throughout their life cycle, even those classified as low-risk. The framework and regulatory process also need to take into consideration the rapid change in digital product development, as processes that extend for a long period of time may become obsolete in supporting decisions about these tools. As these digital health tools become more sophisticated, accessible, widespread, and cheaper, the need for classifying and regulating the sector becomes important, especially with the rapid evolution of these technologies."

Rapid evolution of healthcare monitoring technologies will create a need for reimbursement for active interventions (e.g., device optimisation, remote follow-up) to ensure optimum follow-up care. This study looked at the challenges of reimbursement for novel technologies within existing funding framework. Methods: Secondary research identified reimbursement and funding mechanisms for new medical devices in France, Germany, and the UK. The challenges of reimbursement for innovative devices within existing regulatory framework is summarised. Results: The billing of services for treating patients using medical devices is mainly based on the Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) payment system; however, each country has its own modification of the system. Although the services and tariff under DRG systems are revised annually, obtaining and updating component procedural codes (CCAM in France, OPCS in England, and OPS in Germany) to support adequate reimbursement for a new treatment are prolonged and expensive processes requiring evidence generation and involving multiple stakeholders. New devices are reimbursed under existing DRG-based codes, making this type of reimbursement insufficient for new higher-cost innovations. Discretionary funding mechanisms are also in place to temporarily reimburse new devices (e.g., New Diagnostic and Treatment Methods Regulation [NUB] reimbursement in Germany). Prices of medical devices reimbursed under DRG systems are typically negotiated between hospitals and manufacturers. The budget allocation is not based on payment by results but by a fixed budget distribution system negotiated between payer and provider. Conclusions: The DRG-based payment system in its current form is not compatible with newer technologies looking for fee-per-case type of payment model. A DRG system which has been adapted to suit each healthcare market should adopt a payment modality that encourages efficient use of healthcare resources."

Taking into account recent situation with COVID-19 pandemics, digital technologies allowed to improve management of viral infections via remote monitoring and diagnostics of infected patients. Up to date, various mobile health applications (apps) have been proposed, including apps for the patients diagnosed with cardiovascular pathologies. Objective: The presented review aimed at the analyses of a range of mHealth solutions used to improve primary cardiac care. In addition, we studied the factors driving and hindering the wide introduction of mHealth services in the clinics. Methods: The work was based on the guidelines of the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. The publication search was carried out using PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases. Studies published during the period from 2014 until January 2022 were selected for the analysis. The evaluation of risk of bias for the included studies was conducted using the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias tool. Results and Discussion: An overall 5513 studies were assessed for eligibility after which 39 studies were included. The main trend in the mobile health for cardiological applications is the use of different types of wearable devices and Artificial Intelligence-platforms. In fact, mobile technology allows remotely to monitor, interpret, and analyze biomedical data collected from the patient. Conclusion: The results of this literature search demonstrated that patients diagnosed with cardiovascular disorders can potentially benefit from the application of mHealth in cardiology. However, despite the proven advantages of mHealth for cardiology, there are many challenges and concerns regarding effectiveness, safety, reliability and the lack of official regulation and guidelines from official organizations. Such issues require solutions and further work towards a wide implementation of mHealth technologies in cardiac practice."

The transcriptional factor Forkhead Box M1 (FOXM1) regulates cell proliferation, tumor initiation, and progression in multiple cancer types. However, its biological function and clinical significance in SCLC remain unestablished. Analysis of the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia and SCLC datasets in the present study disclosed significant upregulation of FOXM1 mRNA in SCLC cell lines and tissues. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that FOXM1 is positively correlated with pathways regulating cell proliferation and DNA damage repair, as evident from sensitization of FOXM1-depleted SCLC cells to chemotherapy. Furthermore, Foxm1 knockout inhibited SCLC formation in the Rb1fl/flTrp53fl/flMycLSL/LSL (RPM) mouse model associated with increased levels of neuroendocrine markers, Ascl1 and Cgrp, and decrease in Yap1. Consistently, FOXM1 depletion in NCI-H1688 SCLC cells reduced migration and enhanced apoptosis and sensitivity to cisplatin and etoposide. SCLC with high FOXM1 expression (N = 30, 57.7%) was significantly correlated with advanced clinical stage, extrathoracic metastases, and decrease in overall survival (OS), compared with the low-FOXM1 group (7.90 vs. 12.46 months). Moreover, the high-FOXM1 group showed shorter progression-free survival after standard chemotherapy, compared with the low-FOXM1 group (3.90 vs. 8.69 months).

This is also the aim of the Biofuels Act of 2007 in the Philippines. However, this law is confronted with challenges such as the limitation of lignocellulosic feedstock, specifically available for bioethanol production. The present study sought to address the issue by exploring the potential of mango seed husk (MSH), a by-product of the mango industry, in bioethanol production. MSH is considered a waste material and its utilization also permit value-addition as this can serve as an alternative and affordable source of feedstock in energy production. Two pretreatment strategies are employed to exploit the cellulose and hemicellulose content of MSH, namely, dilute acid treatment and enzymatic hydrolysis. Results show that the %H2SO4 resulting in the highest glucose concentration and yield is 4% v/v at 95 °C hydrolysis temperature, 1:10 (w/v) solid-to-solvent ratio, and 60-min hydrolysis time. For enzymatic hydrolysis using a commercial enzyme preparation, the reaction time up to 72 h did not affect glucose concentration and yield at the following conditions: 50 °C hydrolysis temperature, 150 rpm, pH 5.0, 10% solids loading, and 4% enzyme loading. This could be attributed to the lignin and non-structural compounds present in MSHs. However, a combined process strategy of dilute acid pretreatment followed by enzymatic hydrolysis in the pretreatment of MSH contributes to an increased concentration and yield of sugars in the hydrolysates, which is advantageous for bioethanol production.

The pandemic has forced treatment providers and facilities to rapidly adapt to address these threats while redesigning their structure to accommodate physical distancing regulations. Digital health interventions can function without the need for physical proximity. Clinicians can use digital health intervention, such as telehealth, wearables, mobile applications, and other remote monitoring devices, to convert in-person care to remote-based care, and they can leverage these tools to address some of the pandemic-specific challenges to treatment. The current pandemic provides the opportunity to rapidly explore the advantages and limitations of these technologies in the care of individuals with SUD."

The isolated bacterium is facultative anaerobe, motile, spore-former, and mesophile. It is genetically identified as Paenibacillus glucanolyticus strain HN4 (NCBI Gene Bank Accession No. MT645230). HN4 desulfurized DBT as a model of the recalcitrant thiophenic compounds without affecting its hydrocarbon skeleton via the 4S-pathway producing 2-hydroxybiphenyl (2-HBP) as a dead end product. HN4 substantiated to be a hydrocarbon tolerant, biosurfactants(s) producer, and endorsed unique enzymatic system capable of desulfurizing broad range of thiophenic compounds and expressed an efficient desulfurization activity against the recalcitrant alkylated DBTs. As far our knowledge, it is the first reported BDS study using P. glucanolyticus. Statistical optimization based on One-Factor-At-A-Time (OFAT) technique and response surface methodology (RSM) applied for elucidation of mathematical model correlations describing and optimizing the effect of different physicochemical parameters on batch biphasic BDS process.

Our analysis of health privacy laws indicates that most US patients may have little access to their own digital health data in the United States under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Privacy Rule, whereas the EU General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act grant greater access to device-collected data. Our normative analysis argues for consistently granting patients access to the raw data collected by their implantable devices. Context: Millions of life-sustaining implantable devices collect and relay massive amounts of digital health data, increasingly by using user-downloaded smartphone applications to facilitate data relay to clinicians via manufacturer servers. Whether patients have either legal or normative claims to data collected by these devices, particularly in the raw, granular format beyond that summarized in their medical records, remains incompletely explored. Methods: Using pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) as a clinical model, we outline the clinical ecosystem of data collection, relay, retrieval, and documentation. We consider the legal implications of US and European privacy regulations for patient access to either summary or raw device data. Lastly, we evaluate ethical arguments for or against providing patients access to data beyond the summaries presented in medical records. Findings: Our analysis of applicable health privacy laws indicates that US patients may have little access to their raw data collected and held by device manufacturers in the United States under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Privacy Rule, whereas the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) grants greater access to device-collected data when the processing of personal data falls under the GDPR's territorial scope. The California Consumer Privacy Act, the “little sister” of the GDPR, also grants greater rights to California residents. By contrast, our normative analysis argues for consistently granting patients access to the raw data collected by their implantable devices. Smartphone applications are increasingly involved in the collection, relay, retrieval, and documentation of these data. Therefore, we argue that smartphone user agreements are an emerging but potentially underutilized opportunity for clarifying both legal and ethical claims for device-derived data. Conclusions: Current health privacy legislation incompletely supports patients’ normative claims for access to digital health data."

The yield of MK-7 increased by two fold under high oxygen supply condition of 200 rpm. Further transcriptome analysis indicated that most of the enzymes in MK-7 biosynthesis pathway were also up-regulated. Moreover, glycerol kinase, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase and phosphofructokinase in glycolysis pathway were all up-regulated indicating that high oxygen supply can increase the consumption of substrate glycerol.

Importantly, telemedicine, the delivery of health care and/or health information using electronic systems, can deliver primary and specialized health care to geographically isolated patients, who account for nearly 20% of the US population. In nephrology, where a growing discrepancy exists between the geographic location of nephrologists and patients with kidney disease, telenephrology can bridge distance and deliver renal care and education to the isolated. Large nationalized health care systems, for which incentives are aligned to innovate and implement new platforms to deliver cost-effective care, have been at the forefront of telenephrology. These systems include synchronous direct physician-patient care through clinical videoconferencing, and asynchronous modalities such as electronic consultation and video telehealth to educate internists about specialized clinical topics. Large health care organizations are adopting these platforms as standalone services; however, expansion into the private health care system has been limited by reimbursement, regulations, and other issues. Though telenephrology is patient centered, studies are needed to rigorously test its clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness.

This leads to delayed and uncoordinated movements, and impacts on the patients’ motor performance with reduced movement intensity, increased axial rigidity and impaired cadence regulation. Turning provides privileged insights in postural instability and fall prediction, as it is regularly performed during daily activities, requires multi-limb coordination. The objective of this work was to define a Quality of Movement (QoM) index, inferred from inertial data related to turns, and strictly correlated with the patient's motor conditions, postural stability, and stage of the disease. Such a concise representation finds its main application in the remote monitoring of patients during daily activities at home. We have recorded and analyzed 180° turns in 72 patients, using inertial sensors embedded in the smartphone. We have set up an algorithm for binary classification of patients: mild vs. moderate/severe conditions, according to the Hoehn and Yahr scale of disease progression and disability degree. Our QoM index is defined as the a posteriori probability output by this binary classifier. It exhibits high correlation (r = 0.73) with the clinical score of postural stability, as well as with the average of four clinical scores related to movement impairment (r = 0.75). These results, together with the widespread smartphone use, provide a step in the direction of a practical, objective and reliable tool for PD patients remote monitoring in domestic environment."

Methods: The CFTAH was implanted in a calf and run at various pump operating conditions including mean pump speeds from 2400 to 3600 RPM, sinusoidal speed modulations from 0 to 25%, and speed modulation rates from 80 to 120 B.M. It was also tested under various combinations of simulated high and low systemic vascular resistance and pulmonary vascular resistance via outlet graft clamping and administration of a Nitroprusside respectively. Results: The CFTAH responded to all control inputs and ran as expected during the experiment. The head curves of the right and left pumps generated from measured pressures, measured right flow and calculated left flow, were consistent with in vitro data on this pump. The passive atrial pressure regulation performed well in the normal operating range, and there were no signs of excessive rotor axial displacement during extreme pressure excursions as had been seen in the previous versions of the pump. The left atrial pressure was unusually low throughout most of the experiment and we believe that this may have been due to partial blockage of the of the left inflow cuff proximal to the pressure line tap. This led to several left inlet suction conditions and extreme pressure conditions. Conclusion: The replacement of the standard, single stack stator motor with the new dual stator stack motor resulted in better passive regulation of the pressure difference between the left and right atria. Also, the extreme pressure conditions resulting from left inlet suction events did not cause the pump's rotor to rub against the volute housing as had been seen in previous versions of the pump. Even though the self-regulation was acceptable, shifting of the regulation characteristic to increase the nominal LAP-RAP value will improve the regulation further, and this modification will be implemented prior to the next in vivo experiment."

Using three optical sensors with four light sources, WrisTee allows users to measure 12 photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals at three locations on the radial artery. Two types of PPG signals with opposite polarities were discovered and designated as in-phase and invert-phase signals. We provided a unified viewpoint regarding their differences based on the Beer $-$ Lambert law, and showed that both signals can be used for heart monitoring using data analyzed from a selected subject. Using reflective pulse-transition time (R-PTT) and the standard deviation of R-PTT ($\sigma _{R\text{-}PTT}$), we proposed a method for selecting the optimal wavelength to achieve the best quality signal, thus minimizing storage requirements, power resources, and computational costs. We conducted an experiment on ten subjects to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed method. Our results demonstrated that WrisTee is capable of finding the optimal positions and wavelengths for monitoring vital signs. To automatically detect the PPG phases, six machine learning (ML) models were explored to assess their accuracy for PPG-phase classification. The experimental results show that a convolutional neural network can be the best candidate for phase classification. Hence, it can be integrated into WrisTee for noninvasive health monitoring such as heart rate, heart rate variability, or blood pressure. Our work paves a new direction in bio-signal medical researches by adopting in-phase and invert-phase PPGs for healthcare monitoring."

Body Sensor Networks (BSNs) enable continuous monitoring of human physiological signals and activities, benefiting healthcare and well-being. However, existing BSN systems primarily focus on single-user activity recognition, disregarding multi-user scenarios. Therefore, this paper introduces a collaborative BSN-based architecture for multi-user activity recognition to identify group collaborations among nearby users. We discuss first the general problem of multi-user activity recognition, the associated challenges along with potential solutions (such as data processing, mining techniques, sensor noise, and the complexity of multi-user activities) and, then, the software abstractions and the components of our architecture. This represents an innovative solution of collective intelligence and it holds significant potential for enhancing healthcare and well-being applications by enabling real-time detection of group activities and behaviors."

Chaspari,Toward Privacy-Enhancing Ambulatory-Based Well-Being Monitoring: Investigating User Re-Identification Risk in Multimodal Data,,"The sensitivity of data collected via ambulatory monitoring, which regularly involve the recording of speech signals and sensor information, can cause strong privacy concerns. We investigate user re-identification risk in a corpus of such data collected to observe the interplay between behavior, physiology, and well-being of healthcare workers in their daily life. We then develop a user anonymization approach that preserves well-being information (i.e., anxiety), but eliminates user identify (ID) information. We formulate this via an auto-encoder that learns a transformed version of the original feature set in an adversarial manner so that it minimizes the anxiety estimation loss and maximizes the user classification loss. Results indicate that the original features bear a large user re-identification risk, while also having a good ability to classify a user’s anxiety. After removing the most prone features to user re-identification from the original feature set, the user classification accuracy decreases, while the anxiety classification performance is preserved. The final features transformed via the auto-encoder further reduce evidence of user ID and preserve anxiety classification ability. Findings from this study can contribute to the design privacy-aware bio-behavioral models that can be used for responsible ambulatory monitoring in healthcare and beyond."

It measures five important vitals including blood oxygen saturation (SpO2), respiration rate (RR), heart rate (HR), HR variability (HRV), and temperature. The proposed SoC utilizes a photoplethysmography (PPG) signal to compute HR, HRV, SpO2, and RR. The PPG signal is amplified and filtered using a PPG readout that includes a transimpedance amplifier (TIA) with a switched integrator (SI) to filter and amplify the signal. A differential second-order, delta-sigma analog-to-digital converter ( $\Delta \Sigma $ -ADC) is adopted to digitize the PPG signal. The SoC also comprises a low-power LED driver for both red and infrared (IR) LEDs which operate in pulsed mode with a 0.625% duty cycle. A vital signs extractor performs feature extraction (FE) and computes the vital signs with a maximum absolute error of less than 1%. In this work, the temperature is also measured by employing a Wheatstone bridge (WhB)-based temperature sensor which integrates thermal resistors into a second-order  $\Delta \Sigma $ -ADC. The proposed system shares  $\Delta \Sigma $ -ADC for digitizing the PPG signal and the temperature readings to reduce both area and power consumption. The proposed system computes the temperature over the human’s temperature range ( $32~^{\circ }$  C to  $42~^{\circ }$  C) with an accuracy of +/ $- 0.09~^{\circ }$  C.

However, medical devices are usually challenging to deploy due to privacy regulations, and they generally leverage a centralized third party. Enabling data sharing would enhance new medical studies, formulate new treatments, and deliver new digital health technologies. Solving the issue will have a triple impact: we will handle sensitive information easily, contribute to international medical advancements, and enable personalized care. A possible solution is to exploit decentralization distributing privacy concerns directly to users. Solutions enabling this vision are closely linked to Distributed Ledger Technologies.

The effective control of mean arterial pressure (MAP) in a closed-loop manner is particularly critical for individuals who are critically ill or in the process of recovering from surgical procedures. Within the framework of the present research, an adaptive closed-loop structure has been formulated with the objective of controlling a patient’s MAP through governed administration of the medication sodium nitroprusside (SNP), to attain the desired MAP levels under varying conditions. The proposed closed-loop technique incorporates an intelligent controller known as the active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) with the intention of tracking the desired MAP value, alongside the utilization of continuous action policy gradient (CAPG) for the optimization of the controller’s coefficients. Under the DRL strategy, an actor is responsible for generating policy requests, while a critic assesses the efficacy of the actor’s policy directives. This approach uses gradient descent to train the weight values of both actor and critic networks, and it is dependent on the reward return linked to the MAP fault. Upon comparing the outcomes of the recommended structure with conventional models, numerical simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed system in coping with varying working conditions, key-value fluctuations, and uncertainties, while effectively maintaining the desired mean arterial pressure and drug administration rate."

In more recent scheduling techniques, additional scheduling factors were taken into account, including the priority order of inserting packets using a fixed priority algorithm based on Priority Queuing (PQ), user-defined. Context priorities, user-defined profile priorities, the applications and devices that are currently active, the number of their direct neighboring nodes, the average link quality, and user preferences. A cutting-edge paradigm for communication called the Internet of Things (IoT) permits online connections between parts from various domains. The traditional healthcare system has a growing need for social resources like doctors, nurses, hospital beds, and health monitoring gadgets, making modern healthcare one of the most alluring IoT applications. In this paper, a design for a small wearable sensor patch that can gauge body temperature, photo plethysmography, and the electrocardiogram (ECG) is given. The suggested sensor patch can be used to constantly estimate blood pressure (BP) based on the pulse arrival time (PAT) without the need for additional cables or equipment because ECG and PPG sensors are combined in one device. Three sensors are used to monitor vital signs, a central board is used to analyze and collect signals, and a power board is used to provide power and charge batteries. The entire set of parts is made with a rigid-flexible construction that permits rapid attachment to the body for applications like remote health monitoring. For specialized measurements of a particular physiological signal (such an ECG), the sensors can be taken out of the main board in order to save power. By comparing the suggested sensor patch to a commercial reference device, experiments are done to verify its performance. A tiny Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) module that enables wireless transfer of physiological parameters to a 1/4 SeThe suggested sensor system includes a tiny Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) module that enables wireless communication of physiological values to a gateway. In order to safeguard data while it is being transmitted for security and privacy reasons, both the sensor and the data are encrypted. The wearable sensor system is linked to the Internet cloud, where health data can be kept and later reviewed, by means of a stationary gateway based on laptops and a mobile gateway based on smartphones. The results of the testing show that the platform is viable for use in IoT-connected healthcare applications."

We integrate RNA-seq, DNA sequencing, TCR-seq and SNP array data across multiple regions of liver cancer specimens to map spatio-temporal interactions between cancer and immune cells. We investigate how these interactions reflect intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH) by correlating regional neo-epitope and viral antigen burden with the regional adaptive immune response. Regional expression of passenger mutations dominantly recruits adaptive responses as opposed to hepatitis B virus and cancer-testis antigens. We detect different clonal expansion of the adaptive immune system in distant regions of the same tumor. An ITH-based gene signature improves single-biopsy patient survival predictions and an expression survey of 38,553 single cells across 7 regions of 2 patients further reveals heterogeneity in liver cancer. These data quantify transcriptomic ITH and how the different components of the HCC ecosystem interact during cancer evolution."

Yet, treatment of at-risk patients with various O3FA formulations has produced disparate results in large, well-controlled and well-conducted clinical trials. Prescription formulations and fish oil supplements containing low-dose mixtures of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) have routinely failed to prevent CV events in primary and secondary prevention settings when added to contemporary care, as shown most recently in the STRENGTH and OMEMI trials. However, as observed in JELIS, REDUCE-IT, and RESPECT-EPA, EPA-only formulations significantly reduce CVD events in high-risk patients. The CV mechanism of action of EPA, while certainly multifaceted, does not depend solely on reductions of circulating lipids, including triglycerides (TG) and LDL, and event reduction appears related to achieved EPA levels suggesting that the particular chemical and biological properties of EPA, as compared to DHA and other O3FAs, may contribute to its distinct clinical efficacy. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown different effects of EPA compared with DHA alone or EPA/DHA combination treatments, on atherosclerotic plaque morphology, LDL and membrane oxidation, cholesterol distribution, membrane lipid dynamics, glucose homeostasis, endothelial function, and downstream lipid metabolite function. These findings indicate that prescription-grade, EPA-only formulations provide greater benefit than other O3FAs formulations tested. This review summarizes the clinical findings associated with various O3FA formulations, their efficacy in treating CV disease, and their underlying mechanisms of action."

The failure rate for stents is in the range of 10% to 15%, where they do not remain open, thereby leading to about 40% of the patients with stent implantations requiring repeat procedure within one year, despite increased risk factors and the administration of expensive medicines. Hence, today stent restenosis is a significant cause of deaths globally. Monitoring and treatment matter a lot when it comes to early diagnosis and treatment. A review of the present stent monitoring technology as well as the practical treatment for addressing stent restenosis was conducted. The problems and challenges associated with current stent monitoring technology were illustrated, along with its typical applications. Brief suggestions were given and the progress of stent implants was discussed. It was revealed that prime requisites are needed to achieve good quality implanted stent devices in terms of their size, reliability, etc. This review would positively prompt researchers to augment their efforts towards the expansion of healthcare systems. Lastly, the challenges and concerns associated with nurturing a healthcare system were deliberated with meaningful evaluations."

The electrocardiogram (ECG) has long been a popular tool for assessing and diagnosing cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Since the literature on ECG monitoring devices is growing at an exponential rate, it is becoming difficult for researchers and healthcare professionals to select, compare, and assess the systems that meet their demands while also meeting the monitoring standards. This emphasizes the necessity for a reliable reference to guide the design, categorization, and analysis of ECG monitoring systems, which will benefit both academics and practitioners. We present a complete ECG monitoring system in this work, describing the design stages and implementation of an end-to-end solution for capturing and displaying the patient's heart signals, heart rate, blood oxygen levels, and body temperature. The data will be presented on an OLED display, a developed Android application as well as in MATLAB via serial communication. The Internet of Things (IoT) approaches have a clear advantage in tackling the problem of heart disease patient care as they can transform the service mode into a widespread one and alert the healthcare services based on the patient's physical condition. Keeping this in mind, there is also the addition of a web server for monitoring the patient's status via WiFi. The prototype, which is compliant with the electrical safety regulations and medical equipment design, was further benchmarked against a commercially available off-the-shelf device, and showed an excellent accuracy of 99.56%."

Recent years have seen major developments in the field by integrating electronics within engineered tissues. Previously, the most common types of devices integrated into the body used to be pacemakers and deep brain stimulation electrodes that are stiff and non-compliant; the advent of ultra-thin and flexible electronics has brought forth a significant expansion of the field. Recent developments have enabled interfacing electronics onto, into, and within all tissues and organs with minimal adverse reactions. These have introduced the ability to engineer tissues with built-in electronics that allow for remote monitoring and regulation of tissue function. In this review, we discuss the development of technologies that allowed for the formation of tissue-electronics hybrids and give an overview of the existing examples of these hybrid ""cyborg"" tissues."

Our analysis of health privacy laws indicates that most US patients may have little access to their own digital health data in the United States under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Privacy Rule, whereas the EU General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act grant greater access to device-collected data. Our normative analysis argues for consistently granting patients access to the raw data collected by their implantable devices. CONTEXT: Millions of life-sustaining implantable devices collect and relay massive amounts of digital health data, increasingly by using user-downloaded smartphone applications to facilitate data relay to clinicians via manufacturer servers. Whether patients have either legal or normative claims to data collected by these devices, particularly in the raw, granular format beyond that summarized in their medical records, remains incompletely explored. METHODS: Using pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) as a clinical model, we outline the clinical ecosystem of data collection, relay, retrieval, and documentation. We consider the legal implications of US and European privacy regulations for patient access to either summary or raw device data. Lastly, we evaluate ethical arguments for or against providing patients access to data beyond the summaries presented in medical records. FINDINGS: Our analysis of applicable health privacy laws indicates that US patients may have little access to their raw data collected and held by device manufacturers in the United States under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Privacy Rule, whereas the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) grants greater access to device-collected data when the processing of personal data falls under the GDPR's territorial scope. The California Consumer Privacy Act, the ""little sister"" of the GDPR, also grants greater rights to California residents. By contrast, our normative analysis argues for consistently granting patients access to the raw data collected by their implantable devices. Smartphone applications are increasingly involved in the collection, relay, retrieval, and documentation of these data. Therefore, we argue that smartphone user agreements are an emerging but potentially underutilized opportunity for clarifying both legal and ethical claims for device-derived data. CONCLUSIONS: Current health privacy legislation incompletely supports patients' normative claims for access to digital health data."

The need for further investigation, monitoring and therapeutic management are advancing practical issues which had not been identified for consideration prior to the pandemic. Using the marketing assessment, we identified the needs of the patients and evaluated the future steps necessary in the short term to meet them. The research found progress made via telemedicine in monitoring and conducting minor decisions (like up-titrating the doses of different medication regimens) in patients with several cardiovascular diseases (heart failure, atrial fibrillation, high blood pressure), as there is a worldwide trend to develop new telemonitoring biosensors and devices based on implantable delivered transcatheter. The worldwide telemedicine trend encourages a switch from small and hesitating steps to a more consistent assessment of the patients, based on high technology and Interventional Cardiology. Cardiovascular telemedicine, although made a sustainable effort in managing patients' health, has many obstacles to overcome before meeting all their needs. Data security, confidentiality and reimbursement are the top priorities in developing remote Cardiology. The regulatory institutions need to play an integrative role in leading the way for defining the framework of future telemedicine activities. The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak with all its tragedy served to reinforce the message that telemedicine services can be life-saving for cardiovascular patients. Once the Covid-19 era will fade away, telemedicine is likely to remain a complementary service of standard care. There is still room to improve the remote identification and investigation of heart disease, provide an accurate diagnosis and therapeutic regimen, and update regulations and guidelines to the new realities of technological progress in the field."

Taking into account recent situation with COVID-19 pandemics, digital technologies allowed to improve management of viral infections via remote monitoring and diagnostics of infected patients. Up to date, various mobile health applications (apps) have been proposed, including apps for the patients diagnosed with cardiovascular pathologies. OBJECTIVE: The presented review aimed at the analyses of a range of mHealth solutions used to improve primary cardiac care. In addition, we studied the factors driving and hindering the wide introduction of mHealth services in the clinics. METHODS: The work was based on the guidelines of the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. The publication search was carried out using PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases. Studies published during the period from 2014 until January 2022 were selected for the analysis. The evaluation of risk of bias for the included studies was conducted using the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias tool. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: An overall 5513 studies were assessed for eligibility after which 39 studies were included.. The main trend in the mobile health for cardiological applications is the use of different types of wearable devices and Artificial Intelligence-platforms. In fact, mobile technology allows remotely to monitor, interpret, and analyze biomedical data collected from the patient. CONCLUSION: The results of this literature search demonstrated that patients diagnosed with cardiovascular disorders can potentially benefit from the application of mHealth in cardiology. However, despite the proven advantages of mHealth for cardiology, there are many challenges and concerns regarding effectiveness, safety, reliability and the lack of official regulation and guidelines from official organizations. Such issues require solutions and further work towards a wide implementation of mHealth technologies in cardiac practice."

Importantly, telemedicine, the delivery of health care and/or health information using electronic systems, can deliver primary and specialized health care to geographically isolated patients, who account for nearly 20% of the US population. In nephrology, where a growing discrepancy exists between the geographic location of nephrologists and patients with kidney disease, telenephrology can bridge distance and deliver renal care and education to the isolated. Large nationalized health care systems, for which incentives are aligned to innovate and implement new platforms to deliver cost-effective care, have been at the forefront of telenephrology. These systems include synchronous direct physician-patient care through clinical videoconferencing, and asynchronous modalities such as electronic consultation and video telehealth to educate internists about specialized clinical topics. Large health care organizations are adopting these platforms as standalone services; however, expansion into the private health care system has been limited by reimbursement, regulations, and other issues. Though telenephrology is patient centered, studies are needed to rigorously test its clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness. Nonetheless, growing patient demand for patient-centric health care will continue to expand the telenephrology space."

Yet, little has been published about their role in evolving digital healthcare ecosystem. This study aimed to review the literature on telehealth startups to understand their roles, challenges, business models, and directions for sustainable innovation and commercialization. METHODS: Ten databases were screened: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, ACM digital library, EBSCOhost, Embase, Medline, Cochrane review, and PsycINFO. The articles were shortlisted based on pre-determined screening criteria, and qualitative synthesis was performed. The quality of included studies was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Cohen's K was calculated to ensure the reliability of the authors scoring on the quality appraisal test and qualitative synthesis. RESULTS: 26 articles were included in the review. Findings are clubbed under five themes: remote and on-demand healthcare; healthcare data management; digital therapeutics; high-tech driven personalized care; and information integration and exchange. Technical infrastructure, regulation, and revenue generation were identified as major challenges for telehealth start-ups. Osterwalder business canvas was the predominantly used model. Value perspectives were recognized for a sustainable telehealth innovation and its commercialization. CONCLUSION: Telehealth startups are evolving to meet digital healthcare needs and playing a significant role in teleconsultations, telemonitoring, and electronic health record solutions. Recently, their focus has shifted towards smartphone-enabled AI-driven personalized care, including digital therapeutics and wearable device innovation. They have significant technical and operational challenges in innovation and commercialization to optimize their role. The review also provides researchers with a new understanding of telehealth startups' sustainable innovation and commercialization through the systematic direction of value proposition, creation, and capture."

The obtained data suggest feedback between the organization of microtubule (MT) and actin filament (AF) networks and the expression of the ACT2, TUA6, MAP65-1, CLASP and FH1/FH4 genes. Different regulation of feedback between MT/AF organization and TUA6, ACT2, MAP65-1, CLASP, FH4 and FH1 gene expression was noted during slow clinorotation, possibly due to altered mechanical impact on the cortical cytoskeleton. For the first time, the expression of the tubulin-associated gene MAP65-1 was shown to be dependent upon the organization of AFs. TUA6, MAP65-1, CLASP, FH1 and FH4 likely participate in mechanical signal transduction. Our work demonstrated that slow clinorotation is able to cause mechanical stress."

This study conducted an overview on the opportunities, the perspectives, and the problems related to the integration of TD with AI. The methodology of this review, following a standardized checklist, was based on: (I) a search of PubMed and Scopus and (II) an eligibility assessment, using parameters with five levels of score. The outcome highlighted that applications of this integration have been identified in various skin pathologies and in quality control, both in eHealth and mHealth. Many of these applications are based on Apps used by citizens in mHealth for self-care with new opportunities but also open questions. A generalized enthusiasm has been registered regarding the opportunities and general perspectives on improving the quality of care, optimizing the healthcare processes, minimizing costs, reducing the stress in the healthcare facilities, and in making citizens, now at the center, more satisfied. However, critical issues have emerged related to: (a) the need to improve the process of diffusion of the Apps in the hands of citizens, with better design, validation, standardization, and cybersecurity; (b) the need for better attention paid to medico-legal and ethical issues; and (c) the need for the stabilization of international and national regulations.

This topic is very important, as telemedicine and mHealth, when applied to dermatology, could improve both the quality of healthcare for citizens and the workflow in the health domain. The proposed study was centered on the last three years. We conducted an overview on the opportunities, the perspectives, and the problems involved in TD integration with mHealth. The methodology of the narrative review was based on: (I) a search of PubMed and Scopus and (II) an eligibility assessment, using properly proposed parameters. The outcome of the study showed that during the COVID-19 pandemic, TD integration with mHealth advanced rapidly. This integration enabled the monitoring of dermatological problems and facilitated remote specialist visits, reducing face-to-face interactions. AI and mobile apps have empowered citizens to take an active role in their healthcare. This differs from other imaging sectors where information exchange is limited to professionals. The opportunities for TD in mHealth include improving service quality, streamlining healthcare processes, reducing costs, and providing more accessible care. It can be applied to various conditions, such as (but not limited to) acne, vitiligo, psoriasis, and skin cancers. Integration with AI and augmented reality (AR), as well as the use of wearable sensors, are anticipated as future developments. However, integrating TD with mHealth also brings about problems and challenges related to regulations, ethics, cybersecurity, data privacy, and device management. Scholars and policymakers need to address these issues while involving citizens in the process."

Due to high costs and long waiting times for hospital admission, coupled with technological advances, several centers have developed and implemented video-EEG monitoring in the patient's home (home video-EEG telemetry [HVET]). Here, we review the history and current status of three general approaches to HVET: (1) supervised HVET, which entails setting up video-EEG in the patient's home with daily visiting technologist support; (2) mobile HVET (also termed ambulatory video-EEG), which entails attaching electrodes in a health care facility, supplying the patient and carers with the hardware and instructions, and then asking the patient and carer to set up recording at home without technologist support; and (3) cloud-based HVET, which adds to either of the previous models continuous streaming of video-EEG from the home to the health care provider, with the option to review data in near real time, troubleshoot hardware remotely, and interact remotely with the patient. Our experience shows that HVET can be highly cost-effective and is well received by patients. We note limitations related to long-term electrode attachment and correct camera placing while the patient is unsupervised at home, and concerns related to regulations regarding data privacy for cloud services. We believe that HVET opens significant new opportunities for research, especially in the field of understanding the many influences in seizure occurrence. We speculate that in the future HVET may merge into innovative new multisensor approaches to continuously monitoring people with epilepsy."

The proposed system provides real-time access to a comprehensive set of patients' information, which are made promptly available to the surgical team in the operating room (OR). In particular, the XR platform supports the medical staff by automatically acquiring the patient's vitals from the operating room instrumentation and displaying them in real-time directly on an XR headset. Furthermore, information regarding the patient clinical record is also shown upon request. Finally, the XR-based monitoring platform also allows displaying in XR the video stream coming directly from the endoscope. The innovative aspect of the proposed XR-based monitoring platform lies in the comprehensiveness of the available information, in its modularity and flexibility (in terms of adaption to different sources of data), ease of use, and most importantly, in a reliable communication, which are critical requirements for the healthcare field. To validate the proposed system, experimental tests were conducted using instrumentation typically available in the operating room (i.e., a respiratory ventilator, a patient monitor for intensive care, and an endoscope). The overall results showed (i) an accuracy of the data communication greater than 99 %, along with (ii) an average time response below ms, and (iii) satisfying feedback from the SUS questionnaires filled out by the physicians after intensive use."

Activities such as surveys and public conferences have taken place in the United States, European Union, and Japan. For stakeholder engagement in Japan, a designated research group conducted a survey of academic stakeholders. METHODS: A total of 105 academic stakeholders from 18 institutions responded to the survey. The research group developed recommendations reflecting the survey results and the opinions from patients and the public. RESULTS: The survey showed the top four principles needing renovation were (i) informed consent (Chapter 2.9, 12.4% of respondents believed it needed renovation), (ii) systems for quality assurance (Chapter 2.13, 9.5%), (iii) information on an investigational product (Chapter 2.4, 5.7%), and (iv) procedures on clinical trial information (Chapter 2.10, 5.7%). The top three sections identified as needing renovation were: (i) informed consent (Chapter 4.8, 27.6%), (ii) monitoring (Chapter 5.18, 22.9%), and (iii) composition, functions, and operations of the ethics committee (Chapter 3.2, 14.3%). Recommendations included clarification of ICH-GCP's scope, proportionality in various aspects of clinical trials, diversity and liquidity of ethics committee members, modernization of informed consent procedures, variations in monitoring, and regulatory grade when using real-world data. CONCLUSION: The recommendations from Japanese investigators and patients have been submitted to the ICH E6 Expert Working Group, which will strengthen the robustness of the GCP renovation."

Modifiable causes of I < O deterioration below 97.5%-(I < O)(low)-were sought in 25 gastrointestinal cancer patients and 33 age- and sex-stratified controls. Rest-activity and temperature were tele-monitored with a wireless chest sensor, while daily activities, meals, and sleep were self-reported for one week. Salivary cortisol rhythm and dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) were determined. Circadian parameters were estimated using Hidden Markov modelling, and spectral analysis. Actionable predictors of (I < O)(low) were identified through correlation and regression analyses. Median compliance with protocol exceeded 95%. Circadian disruption-(I < O)(low)-was identified in 13 (52%) patients and four (12%) controls (p = 0.002). Cancer patients with (I < O)(low) had lower median activity counts, worse fragmented sleep, and an abnormal or no circadian temperature rhythm compared to patients with I < O exceeding 97.5%-(I < O)(high)-(p < 0.012). Six (I < O)(low) patients had newly-diagnosed sleep conditions. Altered circadian coordination of rest-activity and chest surface temperature, physical inactivity, and irregular sleep were identified as modifiable determinants of (I < O)(low).

This research describes a free-living and supervised protocol comparison study of the Verisense inertial measurement unit to assess physical activity and sleep parameters and compares it with the Actiwatch 2 actigraph. Fifteen adults (11 males, 23.4 ± 3.4 years and 4 females, 29 ± 12.6 years) wore both monitors for 2 consecutive days and nights in the free-living study while twelve adults (11 males, 23.4 ± 3.4 years and 1 female, 22 ± 0 years) wore both monitors for the duration of a gym-based supervised protocol study. Agreement of physical activity epoch-by-epoch data with activity classification of sedentary, light and moderate-to-vigorous activity and sleep metrics were evaluated using Spearman's rank-order correlation coefficients and Bland-Altman plots. For all activity, Verisense showed high agreement for both free-living and supervised protocol of r = 0.85 and r = 0.78, respectively. For physical activity classification, Verisense showed high agreement of sedentary activity of r = 0.72 for free-living but low agreement of r = 0.36 for supervised protocol; low agreement of light activity of r = 0.42 for free-living and negligible agreement of r = -0.04 for supervised protocol; and moderate agreement of moderate-to-vigorous activity of r = 0.52 for free-living with low agreement of r = 0.49 for supervised protocol. For sleep metrics, Verisense showed moderate agreement for sleep time and total sleep time of r = 0.66 and 0.54, respectively, but demonstrated high agreement for determination of wake time of r = 0.83. Overall, our results showed moderate-high agreement of Verisense with Actiwatch 2 for assessing epoch-by-epoch physical activity and sleep, but a lack of agreement for activity classifications. Future validation work of Verisense for activity cut-point potentially holds promise for 24 h continuous remote patient monitoring."

This allows therapists to monitor the progress of people under their care from a remote location and all with the added benefit that patients are familiar with their own mobile devices; thereby reducing the time required to train patients with the new technology. There is also the added benefit to the health service that there is no additional cost required to purchase devices for use. The Facial Remote Activity Monitoring Eyewear (FRAME) mobile application and web service framework has been designed to work on the IOS and android platforms, the two most commonly used today. Results: The system utilizes secure cloud based data storage to collect, analyse and store data, this allows for near real time, secure access remotely by therapists to monitor their patients and intervene when required. The underlying framework has been designed to be secure, anonymous and flexible to ensure compliance with the data protection act and the latest General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR); this new standard came into effect in April 2018 and replaces the Data Protection Act in the UK and Europe."

Stress, isolation, lack of structure, limited access to physical and mental health care, and changes in treatment paradigms all increase risk of return to drug use events and pose barriers to recovery for people with SUDs. The pandemic has forced treatment providers and facilities to rapidly adapt to address these threats while redesigning their structure to accommodate physical distancing regulations. Digital health interventions can function without the need for physical proximity. Clinicians can use digital health intervention, such as telehealth, wearables, mobile applications, and other remote monitoring devices, to convert in-person care to remote-based care, and they can leverage these tools to address some of the pandemic-specific challenges to treatment. The current pandemic provides the opportunity to rapidly explore the advantages and limitations of these technologies in the care of individuals with SUD."

The proliferation of smartphones and wearable devices enables convenient access to health monitoring tools, educational resources, and communication with healthcare providers. mHealth interventions encompass mobile apps, wearables, and telehealth services that empower users to monitor vital signs, adhere to medication, and adopt healthier lifestyles. Their effectiveness hinges on user engagement, leveraging behavioral science principles and gamification strategies. While mHealth offers advantages such as personalized support and increased reach, it faces challenges pertaining to data privacy, security concerns, and resistance from healthcare providers. Robust encryption and adherence to regulations like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) are crucial for safeguarding sensitive health data. Integrating mHealth into clinical workflows can enhance healthcare delivery, but organizational adjustments are necessary. The future of mHealth is closely intertwined with artificial intelligence (AI), enabling remote monitoring, predictive algorithms, and data-driven insights. Tech giants are incorporating advanced health-tracking capabilities into their devices, paving the way for personalized wellness approaches. However, mHealth grapples with ethical dilemmas surrounding data ownership, privacy breaches, and inadvertent data capture. Despite its potential, mHealth necessitates a concerted effort to overcome obstacles and ensure ethical, secure, and practical implementation. Addressing technical challenges, fostering standardization, and promoting equitable access are pivotal for unlocking the transformative impact of mHealth on cardiovascular health and reducing the global burden of CVD."

However, the general conductive fibers, a major component of the existing wearable monitoring systems, have a positive gauge-factor (GF) that increases electrical resistance when stretched, so that the systems have no choice but to consume power continuously. Herein, a twisted conductive-fiber-based negatively responsive switch-type (NRS) strain-sensor with an extremely high negative GF (resistance change ratio ≈ 3.9 × 10(8) ) that can significantly increase its conductivity from insulating to conducting properties is developed. To this end, a precision cracking technology is devised, which could induce a difference in the Young's modulus of the encapsulated layer on the fiber through selective ultraviolet-irradiation treatment. Owing to this technology, the NRS strain-sensors can allow for effective regulation of the mutual contact resistance under tensile strain while maintaining superior durability for over 5000 stretching cycles. For further practical demonstrations, three healthcare monitoring systems (E-fitness pants, smart-masks, and posture correction T-shirts) with near-zero standby power are also developed, which opens up advancements in electronic textiles by expanding the utilization range of fiber strain-sensors."

An increased level of circulating tumor cells (CTCs), metastatic cancer cells that have intravasated into the circulatory system, is particularly associated with colonization of distant organs and poor prognosis. However, the key factors required for tumor cell dissemination and colonization remain elusive. We found that high expression of desmoglein2 (DSG2), a component of desmosome-mediated intercellular adhesion complexes, promoted tumor growth, increased the prevalence of CTC clusters, and facilitated distant organ colonization. The dynamic regulation of DSG2 by hypoxia was key to this process, as down-regulation of DSG2 in hypoxic regions of primary tumors led to elevated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) gene expression, allowing cells to detach from the primary tumor and undergo intravasation. Subsequent derepression of DSG2 after intravasation and release of hypoxic stress was associated with an increased ability to colonize distant organs. This dynamic regulation of DSG2 was mediated by Hypoxia-Induced Factor1α (HIF1α). In contrast to its more widely observed function to promote expression of hypoxia-inducible genes, HIF1α repressed DSG2 by recruitment of the polycomb repressive complex 2 components, EZH2 and SUZ12, to the DSG2 promoter in hypoxic cells. Consistent with our experimental data, DSG2 expression level correlated with poor prognosis and recurrence risk in breast cancer patients. Together, these results demonstrated the importance of DSG2 expression in metastasis and revealed a mechanism by which hypoxia drives metastasis."

AIM: The goal of this perspective is to highlight the existing and future role of wearable and RPM optical technologies in an increasingly at-home healthcare and research environment. APPROACH: First, the specific changes occurring during the COVID-19 pandemic in healthcare delivery, regulations, and technological innovations related to RPM technologies are reviewed. Then, a review of the current state and potential future impact of optical physiological monitoring in portable and wearable formats is outlined. RESULTS: New efforts from academia, industry, and regulatory agencies are advancing and encouraging at-home, portable, and wearable physiological monitors as a growing part of healthcare delivery. It is hoped that these shifts will assist with disease diagnosis, treatment, management, recovery, and rehabilitation with minimal in-person contact. Some of these trends are likely to persist for years to come. Optical technologies already account for a large portion of RPM platforms, with a good potential for future growth. CONCLUSIONS: The biomedical optics community has a potentially large role to play in developing, testing, and commercializing new wearable and RPM technologies to meet the changing healthcare and research landscape in the COVID-19 era and beyond."

Similar to the European General Data Protection Regulation, in Brazil, the Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados established rules and guidelines for the processing of personal data, including those used for patient care, such as those captured by smartwatches. Thus, in any telemonitoring scenario, there is a need to comply with rules and regulations, making this issue a challenge to overcome. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to build a digital solution model for capturing data from wearable devices and making them available in a safe and agile manner for clinical and research use, following current laws. METHODS: A functional model was built following the Brazilian Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados (2018), where data captured by smartwatches can be transmitted anonymously over the Internet of Things and be identified later within the hospital. A total of 80 volunteers were selected for a 24-week follow-up clinical trial divided into 2 groups, one group with a previous diagnosis of COVID-19 and a control group without a previous diagnosis of COVID-19, to measure the synchronization rate of the platform with the devices and the accuracy and precision of the smartwatch in out-of-hospital conditions to simulate remote monitoring at home. RESULTS: In a 35-week clinical trial, >11.2 million records were collected with no system downtime; 66% of continuous beats per minute were synchronized within 24 hours (79% within 2 days and 91% within a week). In the limit of agreement analysis, the mean differences in oxygen saturation, diastolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure, and heart rate were -1.280% (SD 5.679%), -1.399 (SD 19.112) mm Hg, -1.536 (SD 24.244) mm Hg, and 0.566 (SD 3.114) beats per minute, respectively. Furthermore, there was no difference in the 2 study groups in terms of data analysis (neither using the smartwatch nor the gold-standard devices), but it is worth mentioning that all volunteers in the COVID-19 group were already cured of the infection and were highly functional in their daily work life. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the results obtained, considering the validation conditions of accuracy and precision and simulating an extrahospital use environment, the functional model built in this study is capable of capturing data from the smartwatch and anonymously providing it to health care services, where they can be treated according to the legislation and be used to support clinical decisions during remote monitoring."

D-serine, a racemization product of L-serine is one such amino acid present in various prokaryotes and eukaryotes. It is a well-recognized regulator of various activities in the human nervous system. In plants, it has a role in the nitrogen cycle regulation and pollen tube growth. Serine enantiomers are present in different concentrations and few bacterial strains are reported to contribute to D-serine in the environment. During the present study, soil samples from different places in North India were collected and processed to isolate and screen the bacteria on M9 minimal media (Himedia) for D-serine synthesis. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC Silica gel 60 F 254 (20 × 20 cm, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and Mass spectroscopic analysis (Bruker MICROTOF II spectrometer) studies, etc were performed. D-serine-producing isolates were characterized as per standard procedures.

Our study aimed at elucidating the role of insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 3 (IGF2BP3) in NPC metastasis and the underlying mechanism involved. IGF2BP3 expression in NPC was determined by bioinformatics, quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry analyses. The biological function of IGF2BP3 was investigated by using in vitro and in vivo studies. In this study, IGF2BP3 mRNA and protein levels were elevated in NPC tissues. In addition, IGF2BP3 exerted an oncogenic role by promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), thereby inducing NPC cell migration and invasion. Further studies revealed that IGF2BP3 regulated the expression of key regulators of EMT by activating AKT/mTOR signalling, thus stimulating NPC cell migration and invasion. Remarkably, targeting IGF2BP3 delayed NPC metastasis through attenuating p-AKT and vimentin expression and inducing E-cadherin expression in vivo. Moreover, IGF2BP3 protein levels positively correlated with distant metastasis after initial treatment. Importantly, IGF2BP3 expression served as an independent prognostic factor in predicting the overall survival and distant metastasis-free survival of NPC patients. This work identifies IGF2BP3 as a novel prognostic marker and a new target for NPC treatment."

Such online telemedicine is usually achieved with the help of sophisticated and advanced wearable sensor technologies. The modern type of wearable connected devices enable the monitoring of vital sign parameters such as: heart rate variability (HRV) also known as electrocardiogram (ECG), blood pressure (BLP), Respiratory rate and body temperature, blood pressure (BLP), respiratory rate, and body temperature. The ubiquitous problem of wearable devices is their power demand for signal transmission; such devices require frequent battery charging, which causes serious limitations to the continuous monitoring of vital data. To overcome this, the current study provides a primary report on collecting kinetic energy from daily human activities for monitoring vital human signs. The harvested energy is used to sustain the battery autonomy of wearable devices, which allows for a longer monitoring time of vital data. This study proposes a novel type of stress- or exercise-monitoring ECG device based on a microcontroller (PIC18F4550) and a Wi-Fi device (ESP8266), which is cost-effective and enables real-time monitoring of heart rate in the cloud during normal daily activities. In order to achieve both portability and maximum power, the harvester has a small structure and low friction. Neodymium magnets were chosen for their high magnetic strength, versatility, and compact size. Due to the non-linear magnetic force interaction of the magnets, the non-linear part of the dynamic equation has an inverse quadratic form. Electromechanical damping is considered in this study, and the quadratic non-linearity is approximated using MacLaurin expansion, which enables us to find the law of motion for general case studies using classical methods for dynamic equations and the suitable parameters for the harvester. The oscillations are enabled by applying an initial force, and there is a loss of energy due to the electromechanical damping. A typical numerical application is computed with Matlab 2015 software, and an ODE45 solver is used to verify the accuracy of the method."

Here, we developed a nomogram to effectively predict postoperative disease-free survival (DFS) in DTC patients. METHODS: The mRNA expressions and clinical data of DTC patients were downloaded from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Seventy percent of patients were randomly selected as the training dataset, and thirty percent of patients were classified into the testing dataset. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was adopted to establish a nomogram to predict 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year DFS rate of DTC patients. RESULTS: A five-gene signature comprised of TENM1, FN1, APOD, F12, and BTNL8 genes was established to predict the DFS rate of DTC patients. Results from the concordance index (C-index), area under curve (AUC), and calibration curve showed that both the training dataset and the testing dataset exhibited good prediction ability, and they were superior to other traditional models. The risk score and distant metastasis (M) of the five-gene signature were independent risk factors that affected DTC recurrence. A nomogram that could predict 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year DFS rate of DTC patients was established with a C-index of 0.801 (95% CI: 0.736, 0.866). CONCLUSION: Our study developed a prediction model based on the gene expression and clinical characteristics to predict the DFS rate of DTC patients, which may be applied to more accurately assess patient prognosis and individualized treatment."

Smaller children supported with LVADs typically remain hospitalized for months awaiting heart transplant-a major burden for families and a challenge for hospitals. We describe the initial outcomes of the Jarvik 2015, a miniaturized implantable continuous flow LVAD, in the NHLBI-funded Pumps for Kids, Infants, and Neonates (PumpKIN) study, for bridge-to-heart transplant. METHODS: Children weighing 8 to 30 kg with severe systolic heart failure and failing optimal medical therapy were recruited at 7 centers in the United States. Patients with severe right heart failure and single-ventricle congenital heart disease were excluded. The primary feasibility endpoint was survival to 30 days without severe stroke or non-operational device failure. RESULTS: Of 7 children implanted, the median age was 2.2 (range 0.7, 7.1) years, median weight 10 (8.2 to 20.7) kilograms; 86% had dilated cardiomyopathy; 29% were INTERMACS profile 1. The median duration of Jarvik 2015 support was 149 (range 5 to 188) days where all 7 children survived including 5 to heart transplant, 1 to recovery, and 1 to conversion to a paracorporeal device. One patient experienced an ischemic stroke on day 53 of device support in the setting of myocardial recovery. One patient required ECMO support for intractable ventricular arrhythmias and was eventually transplanted from paracorporeal biventricular VAD support. The median pump speed was 1600 RPM with power ranging from 1-4 Watts. The median plasma free hemoglobin was 19, 30, 19 and 30 mg/dL at 7, 30, 90 and 180 days or time of explant, respectively. All patients reached the primary feasibility endpoint. Patient-reported outcomes with the device were favorable with respect to participation in a full range of activities. Due to financial issues with the manufacturer, the study was suspended after consent of the eighth patient. CONCLUSION: The Jarvik 2015 LVAD appears to hold important promise as an implantable continuous flow device for smaller children that may support hospital discharge. The FDA has approved the device to proceed to a 22-subject pivotal trial. Whether this device will survive to commercialization remains unclear because of the financial challenges faced by industry seeking to develop pediatric medical devices.

2022 Aug 3,JMIR cardio,10.2196/34959 [doi] e34959,Buhr L; Kaufmann PLM; Jörß K,Attitudes of Patients With Chronic Heart Failure Toward Digital Device Data for Self-documentation and Research in Germany: Cross-sectional Survey Study.,Canada,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, the use of digital mobile measurement devices (DMMDs) for self-documentation in cardiovascular care in Western industrialized health care systems has increased. For patients with chronic heart failure (cHF), digital self-documentation plays an increasingly important role in self-management. Data from DMMDs can also be integrated into telemonitoring programs or data-intensive medical research to collect and evaluate patient-reported outcome measures through data sharing. However, the implementation of data-intensive devices and data sharing poses several challenges for doctors and patients as well as for the ethical governance of data-driven medical research. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the potential and challenges of digital device data in cardiology research from patients' perspectives. Leading research questions of the study concerned the attitudes of patients with cHF toward health-related data collected in the use of digital devices for self-documentation as well as sharing these data and consenting to data sharing for research purposes. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of patients of a research in cardiology was conducted at a German university medical center (N=159) in 2020 (March to July). Eligible participants were German-speaking adult patients with cHF at that center. A pen-and-pencil questionnaire was sent by mail. RESULTS: Most participants (77/105, 73.3%) approved digital documentation, as they expected the device data to help them observe their body and its functions more objectively. Digital device data were believed to provide cognitive support, both for patients' self-assessment and doctors' evaluation of their patients' current health condition. Interestingly, positive attitudes toward DMMD data providing cognitive support were, in particular, voiced by older patients aged >65 years. However, approximately half of the participants (56/105, 53.3%) also reported difficulty in dealing with self-documented data that lay outside the optimal medical target range. Furthermore, our findings revealed preferences for the self-management of DMMD data disclosed for data-intensive medical research among German patients with cHF, which are best implemented with a dynamic consent model. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide potentially valuable insights for introducing DMMD in cardiovascular research in the German context. They have several practical implications, such as a high divergence in attitudes among patients with cHF toward different data-receiving organizations as well as a large variance in preferences for the modes of receiving information included in the consenting procedure for data sharing for research. We suggest addressing patients' multiple views on consenting and data sharing in institutional normative governance frameworks for data-intensive medical research."

However, it is difficult to simultaneously manufacture conductive hydrogel-based multifunctional strain sensors with the synergistic properties of reliable healability for long-term usage and environmental degradability/recyclability for decreasing the electronic waste. This work reports a facile strategy to engineer a self-healing, recyclable and conductive strain sensor by virtue of molecular-level multi-dynamic interactions (MMDIs) including Schiff base complexes, hydrogen bonds, and coordination bonds, which were fabricated using a dialdehyde TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl)-oxidized nanofibrillated cellulose (DATNFC) pre-reinforced gelatin nanocomposite hydrogel (gelatin/DATNFC hydrogel, GDH) followed by dipping in an Fe(3+) aqueous solution. The MMDI strategy allows synchronous regulation of both bulk and interfacial interactions to obtain exciting properties that outperform those of conventional hydrogels, including extraordinary compressive stress (1310 kPa), intriguing self-healing abilities, and remarkable electrical conductivity. With these outstanding merits, the as-prepared gelatin/DATNFC/Fe(3+) hydrogel (GDIH) is developed to be a multifunctional strain sensor with appealing strain sensitivity (GF = 2.24 under 6% strain) and compressive sensitivity (S = 1.14 kPa(-1) under 15 kPa), which can be utilized to manufacture electronic skin and accurately discern subtle bodily motions, handwriting and personal signatures. Notably, this GDIH-based sensor also exhibited reliable self-healing properties for long-term usage, environmental degradability and complete recyclability for decreasing the electronic waste. In consideration of the extremely facile preparation process, biocompatibility, satisfactory functionalities, remarkable self-healing properties and recyclability, the emergence of the GDIH-based sensor is believed to propose a new strategy for the development of sustainable-multifunctional strain sensors and healthcare monitoring."

However, in situ regulation of the mechanical properties of hydrogels is still a challenge, and regular conductive hydrogels will inevitably freeze at subzero temperature and easily dehydrate, which leads to a short service life. Herein, a novel adhesive hydrogel (PAA-Dopa-Zr(4+)) capable of strain sensing is proposed with antifreezing, nondrying, strong surface adhesion, and tunable mechanical properties. 3,4-Dihydroxyphenyl-l-alanine (l-Dopa)-grafted poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and Zr(4+) ion are introduced into the hydrogel, which broadly alters the mechanical properties via tuning the in situ aggregation state of polymer chains by ions based on the complexation effect. The catechol groups of l-Dopa and viscous glucose endow the hydrogel with high adhesiveness for skin and device interface (including humid and dry environments) and exhibit an outstanding temperature tolerance under extreme wide temperature spectrum (-35 to 65 °C) or long-lasting moisture retention (60 days). Furthermore, this PAA-Dopa-Zr(4+) can be assembled as a flexible strain-sensitive sensor to detect human motions based on specific mechanical properties requirements. This work, enabling superior adhesive and temperature tolerance performance and broad mechanical tenability, presents a new paradigm for numerous applications to wearable sensing and personalized healthcare monitoring."
2021 Jun 3,JMIR biomedical engineering,10.2196/26942 [doi] e26942,Salisbury JP,Using Medical Device Standards for Design and Risk Management of Immersive Virtual Reality for At-Home Therapy and Remote Patient Monitoring.,Canada,"Numerous virtual reality (VR) systems have received regulatory clearance as therapeutic medical devices for in-clinic and at-home use. These systems enable remote patient monitoring of clinician-prescribed rehabilitation exercises, although most of these systems are nonimmersive. With the expanding availability of affordable and easy-to-use head-mounted display (HMD)-based VR, there is growing interest in immersive VR therapies. However, HMD-based VR presents unique risks. Following standards for medical device development, the objective of this paper is to demonstrate a risk management process for a generic immersive VR system for remote patient monitoring of at-home therapy. Regulations, standards, and guidance documents applicable to therapeutic VR design are reviewed to provide necessary background. Generic requirements for an immersive VR system for home use and remote patient monitoring are identified using predicate analysis and specified for both patients and clinicians using user stories. To analyze risk, failure modes and effects analysis, adapted for medical device risk management, is performed on the generic user stories and a set of risk control measures is proposed. Many therapeutic applications of VR would be regulated as a medical device if they were to be commercially marketed. Understanding relevant standards for design and risk management early in the development process can help expedite the availability of innovative VR therapies that are safe and effective."

Little is known about the acceptability and sustainability of integrating wearables into routine care from the perspectives of people with CF (pwCF) and their treating clinicians. METHODS: A cross-sectional qualitative study involving semi-structured interviews with adult pwCF and focus groups comprising members of a CF multidisciplinary team (MDT) were conducted at a specialist CF centre in Australia. A phenomenological orientation underpinned the study. Inductive thematic analysis was performed using the Framework method. The study adhered to the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) checklist. RESULTS: Nine pwCF and eight members of a CF MDT, representing six clinical disciplines, participated in the study. Eight themes were inductively generated from the data, of which four were identified from each group. PwCF valued wearables for providing real-time data to motivate healthy behaviours and support shared goal-setting with healthcare providers. Wearables did not influence adherence to CF-specific self-management practices and had some hardware limitations. Members of the CF MDT recognised potential benefits of remote monitoring and shared goal-setting, but advised caution regarding data accuracy, generating patient anxiety in certain personality traits, and lack of evidence supporting use in CF self-management. CONCLUSIONS: Perspectives on integrating wearables into CF care were cautiously optimistic, with emerging risks related to patient anxiety and lack of evidence moderating acceptance."

The proposed dielectric layer with uniformly distributed interior microporous can not only increase its compressibility and dynamic response within an extended pressure range but also enlarge its contact area with electrodes, contributing to a simultaneous improvement in the sensitivity, response speed, detection range, and structure robustness. Meanwhile, owing to its superior abilities in complex structure manufacturing and dimension controlling, the proposed 3D-printing-based fabrication process enables the consistent fabrication of the porous microstructure and thus guarantees device consistency. As a result, the prepared pressure sensors exhibit a high sensitivity of 0.21 kPa(-1), fast response and relaxation times of 112 and 152 ms, an interface bonding strength of more than 455.2 kPa, and excellent performance consistency (≤5.47% deviation among different batches of sensors) and tunability. Encouraged by this, the pressure sensor is further integrated with a wireless readout circuit and realizes wireless wearable monitoring of various biosignals (pulse waves and heart rate) and body movements (from slight finger touch to large knee bending). Finally, the influence law of the feature parameters of the porous microstructure on device performance is established by the finite element method, paving the way for sensor optimization. This study motivates the development of flexible capacitive pressure sensors toward practical application."

A characterization of the yeast, including the optimization of its metabolism and growth conditions, its detoxification effectiveness and the degradation pathway of the target azo dye, as well as a determination of the key activities of the enzyme, was performed. Finally, the possible halotolerance mechanisms of the yeast were proposed through a comparative transcriptome analysis. The results show that a halotolerant yeast, A4, which could decolorize various azo dyes, was isolated from a marine environment and was identified as Meyerozyma guilliermondii. Its optimal conditions for dye decolorization were ≥1.0 g/L of sucrose, ≥0.2 g/L of (NH(4))(2)SO(4), 0.06 g/L of yeast extract, pH 6.0, a temperature of 35 °C and a rotation speed of ≥160 rpm. The yeast, A4, degraded and detoxified ARB through a series of steps, relying on the key enzymes that might be involved in the degradation of azo dye and aromatic compounds. The halotolerance of the yeast, A4, was mainly related to the regulation of the cell wall components and the excessive uptake of Na(+)/K(+) and/or compatible organic solutes into the cells under different salinity conditions. The up-regulation of genes encoding Ca(2+)-ATPase and casein kinase II as well as the enrichment of KEGG pathways associated with proteasome and ribosome might also be responsible for its halotolerance."

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate a novel method to enhance therapeutic efficacy of Apatinib (as a chemotherapeutic agent) by co-administration of Curcumin (as a bioactive herbal compound) in breast cancer treatment. METHODS: Effects of Apatinib, Curcumin, and their combinations (Apa-Cur) was evaluated on viability and proliferation of breast cell line (MCF7) by MTT assay. Moreover, effects of Apatinib, Curcumin, and Apa-Cur was investigated on apoptosis rate in the cancer cells. Expression levels of apoptosis-related genes (BAX, SMAC, BCL2, and SURVIVIN) in treated cancer cells and untreated controls were evaluated using the Real-Time PCR method. RESULTS: The obtained results showed that all treatments of Apatinib, Curcumin, and Apa-Cur significantly decreased viability and proliferation of the breast cancer cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. However, anti-proliferation activity of Apa-Cur combination was significantly higher than Apatinib and Curcumin treatment alone. In addition, Apatinib, Curcumin, and Apa-Cur increased apoptosis percentage in the treated cancer cells through regulation of apoptosis-related genes expression. CONCLUSIONS: In general, Apa-Cur combination therapy exerts more profound anti-proliferation effects on breast cancer cell than Apatinib or Curcumin monotherapy. However, further studies are required to identify other possible signaling pathways and mechanisms involved in the anticancer effects of Apatinib, Curcumin, and Apa-Cur."

Here, we illuminated the roles of CD44 isoforms in this process. Isoforms 3 and 4 were predominantly expressed in CRC patients. CD44 isoform 4 indicated poor outcome and correlated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and decreased oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) in patients; opposite associations were found for isoform 3. Pan-CD44 knockdown (kd) independently impaired primary tumor formation and abrogated distant metastasis in CRC xenografts. The xenograft tumors mainly expressed the clinically relevant CD44 isoforms 3 and 4. Both isoforms were enhanced in the paranecrotic, hypoxic tumor regions but were generally absent in lung metastases. Upon CD44 kd, tumor angiogenesis was increased in the paranecrotic areas, accompanied by reduced hypoxia-inducible factor-1α and CEACAM5 but increased E-cadherin expression. Mitochondrial genes and proteins were induced upon pan-CD44 kd, as were OxPhos genes. Hypoxia increased VEGF release from tumor spheres, particularly upon CD44 kd. Genes affected upon CD44 kd in xenografts specifically overlapped concordantly with genes correlating with CD44 isoform 4 (but not isoform 3) in patients, validating the clinical relevance of the used model and highlighting the metastasis-promoting role of CD44 isoform 4."

The estimators of the multifractal spectrum potentially reflect the adaptive use of perception, cognition, and action. To observe time-specific behavior in multifractal dynamics, a multiscale multifractal analysis based on DFA (MFMS-DFA) has been recently proposed and applied to cardiovascular dynamics. Here we aimed at evaluating whether MFMS-DFA allows identifying multiscale structures in the dynamics of human movements. Thirty-six (12 females) participants pedaled freely, after a metronomic initiation of the cadence at 60 rpm, against a light workload for 10 min: in reference to cycling (C), cycling while playing ""Tetris"" on a computer, alone (CT) or collaboratively (CTC) with another pedaling participant. Pedal revolution periods (PRP) series were examined with MFMS-DFA and compared to linearized surrogates, which attested to a presence of multifractality at almost all scales. A marked alteration in multifractality when playing Tetris was evidenced at two scales, τ ≈ 16 and τ ≈ 64 s, yet less marked at τ ≈ 16 s when playing collaboratively. Playing Tetris in collaboration attenuated these alterations, especially in the best Tetris players. This observation suggests the high sensitivity to cognitive demand of MFMS-DFA estimators, extending to the assessment of skill/demand interplay from individual behavior. So, by identifying scale-dependent multifractal structures in movement dynamics, MFMS-DFA has obvious potential for examining brain-movement coordinative structures, likely with sufficient sensitivity to find echo in diagnosing disorders and monitoring the progress of diseases that affect cognition and movement control."

Methods: The Oncomine and CCLE databases were used to investigate the differential expression of FSIP2 in ccRCC versus other cancer types. Levels of FSIP2 in 85 ccRCC patients were assessed by immunohistochemical analysis; clinicopathological features related to FSIP2 expression were examined in these patients finally, disease-free survival and overall survival were estimated by survival analysis to elucidate the impact of FSIP2 expression in ccRCC patients. Results: Analysis using the Oncomine database revealed significant upregulation of the FSIP2 gene in papillary RCC, compared to that in normal tissues. Additionally, FSIP2 expression was found to be significantly associated with abnormal platelet count, positive distant metastasis, and death as the incidence of distant metastasis and death were higher in patients with FSIP2 expression compared to those without FSIP2 expression. Survival analysis revealed that FSIP2 expression was significantly related to shorter disease-free survival and overall survival. Meanwhile, patients with FSIP2 expression had worse prognosis than those without FSIP2 expression. Conclusions: FSIP2 expression is associated with poor survival outcomes and poor prognosis in ccRCC patients. FSIP2 may therefore serve as a potential predictive biomarker of ccRCC prognosis."

In an attempt to achieve the worldwide regulations of ultra-low sulfur transportation fuels without affecting its hydrocarbon skeleton, a biphasic medium containing 100 mg/L DBT dissolved in n-hexadecane (1/4 oil/water v/v) used for enrichment and isolation of selective biodesulfurizing bacterium from an oil-polluted sediment sample collected from Egyptian Red Sea shoreline. The isolated bacterium is facultative anaerobe, motile, spore-former, and mesophile. It is genetically identified as Paenibacillus glucanolyticus strain HN4 (NCBI Gene Bank Accession No. MT645230). HN4 desulfurized DBT as a model of the recalcitrant thiophenic compounds without affecting its hydrocarbon skeleton via the 4S-pathway producing 2-hydroxybiphenyl (2-HBP) as a dead end product. HN4 substantiated to be a hydrocarbon tolerant, biosurfactants(s) producer, and endorsed unique enzymatic system capable of desulfurizing broad range of thiophenic compounds and expressed an efficient desulfurization activity against the recalcitrant alkylated DBTs. As far our knowledge, it is the first reported BDS study using P. glucanolyticus. Statistical optimization based on One-Factor-At-A-Time (OFAT) technique and response surface methodology (RSM) applied for elucidation of mathematical model correlations describing and optimizing the effect of different physicochemical parameters on batch biphasic BDS process. That illustrated an approximate increase in BDS efficiency by 1.34 fold and recorded 94% sulfur removal in biphasic batch process at optimum operation conditions of 120 h, 0.14 wt% S-content model oil (DBT dissolved in n-hexadecane), 33.5 °C, pH7 and 1/1 oil/water phase ratio, and 147 rpm. Resting cells of HN4 in a biphasic reactor (1/1 v/v) decreased the sulfur content of a refractory thiophenic model oil (thiophene, benzothiophene, DBT, and alkylated DBT dissolved in n-hexadecane) from 0.14 to 0.027 wt%, and petro-diesel from 0.2 to 0.04 wt%, within 120 h, keeping the calorific value of the treated fuel intact. Consequently, that novel strain could be recommended as a promising candidate for BDS as complementary to hydrodesulfurization process in oil refinery."

S. cohnii L1-N1 exhibited a reduction of 24.4 % in Cr(6+) and an adsorption rate of 6.43 % for Cd over a period of 5 days. These results were achieved under optimal conditions of pH (7.0), temperature (35 °C), shaking speed (200 rpm), and inoculum volume (8 %). B. cereus strain CKN12 exhibited complete reduction of Cr(6+) within a span of 48 h, while it demonstrated a 57.3 % adsorption capacity for Cd over a period of 120 h. These results were achieved under conditions of optimal pH (8.0), temperature (40 °C), shaking speed (150 rpm), and inoculum volume (2-3 %). Additionally, microcharacterization and ICP-MS analysis revealed that Cr and Cd were accumulated on the cell surface, whereas Cr(6+) was mainly reduced extracellularly. Subsequently, a series of pot experiments were conducted to provide evidence that the inclusion of S. cohnii L1-N1 or B. cereus CKN12 into the system resulted in a notable enhancement in both the plant height and biomass of king grass. In particular, it was observed that the presence of S. cohnii L1-N1 or B. cereus CKN12 in king grass led to a significant reduction in the levels of Cd and Cr in the soils (36.0 % and 27.8 %, or 72.9 % and 47.4 %, respectively). Thus, the results of this study indicate that the combined use of two bacterial strains can effectively aid in the remediation of tropical soils contaminated with moderate to light levels of Cd and Cr."

In this study, the regulation of Cu(II) on SAs adsorption and release of dissolved organic matters (DOMs) by fungi-microalgae pellets (FM-pellets) were investigated. Aspergillus oryzae pellets were prepared for combination with Chlorella vulgaris and the optimal conditions were at agitation speed of 130 rpm, fungi to microalgae ratio of 10:1 and the combined time of 3 h with the highest combination efficiency of 98.65%. The results showed that adsorption was the main mechanism for SAs removal. FM-pellets exhibited a high SAs adsorption potential within 6 h, and the adsorption capacity of sulfamethazine (SMZ), sulfamonomethoxine (SMM) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) was 1.07, 0.94 and 1.67 mg/g, respectively. Furthermore, the removal of SMX, SMZ and SMM was greatly promoted from 62.31% to 85.21%, 58.71-67.91% and 64.17-80.31%, respectively, under the presence of 2 mg/L Cu(II) through ion exchange and adsorption bridging. DOMs were analyzed by the parallel factor (PARAFAC) to demonstrate the response mechanism of FM-pellets to Cu(II). Protein-like substances and NADH in DOMs released by FM-pellets formed complexes with Cu(II) to alleviate the damage on the organism. These findings provide new insights into the mechanism and response of Cu(II) in the removal of SAs by FM-pellets."

This meta-analysis aims to determine the prognostic significance of miR-140-5p expression in patients with various malignancies. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Web of Science, ProQuest, Cochrane, and Google Scholar to identify relevant studies published before June 2023. Pooled hazard ratios (HR) and odds ratios (OR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to assess the prognostic importance and clinicopathological features of miR-140-5p in overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) of cancer patients, respectively. The CancerMIRNome database and other OS analysis webservers were utilized to explore the prognostic value and expression profile of miR-140-5p. A total of 17 studies were included in the final analysis. The results demonstrated that decreased miR-140-5p expression was significantly associated with inferior OS (pooled HR 0.63; 95 % CI, 0.51-0.79; p < 0.001) and DFS (pooled HR 0.40; 95 % CI, 0.25-0.64; p < 0.001). Pooled ORs indicated a significant correlation between reduced miR-140-5p expression and positive lymph node metastasis (LNM; OR = 3.42; 95 % CI, 2.36-4.94; p < 0.001), advanced tumor stage (OR = 2.80; 95 % CI, 2.07-3.78; p < 0.001), and positive distant metastasis (DM; OR = 10.81; 95 % CI, 3.31-35.30; p < 0.001). No significant associations were observed between miR-140-5p expression and gender (OR = 0.94; 95 % CI, 0.70-1.28; p = 0.70), age (OR = 1.31; 95 % CI, 0.99-1.74; p = 0.06), tumor size (OR = 1.55; 95 % CI, 0.77-3.10; p = 0.22), and histological grade (OR = 1.20; 95 % CI, 0.46-3.10; p = 0.71). Subgroup analyses revealed that decreased miR-140-5p expression was associated with shorter OS in subgroups based on sample size (<100 or >100), tumor origin (GI or non-GI), and cancer type (GC/CRC). Bioinformatic analysis supported the finding that miR-140-5p was downregulated in most tumor tissues, and its reduced expression was linked to poor prognosis in patients with multiple malignancies. The prognostic significance of miR-140-5p in predicting reduced OS and DFS suggests that measuring miR-140-5p expression levels before treatment could serve as a valuable biomarker for identifying cancer patients with an unfavorable prognosis and improving clinical management."

The transcriptional factor Forkhead Box M1 (FOXM1) regulates cell proliferation, tumor initiation, and progression in multiple cancer types. However, its biological function and clinical significance in SCLC remain unestablished. Analysis of the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia and SCLC datasets in the present study disclosed significant upregulation of FOXM1 mRNA in SCLC cell lines and tissues. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that FOXM1 is positively correlated with pathways regulating cell proliferation and DNA damage repair, as evident from sensitization of FOXM1-depleted SCLC cells to chemotherapy. Furthermore, Foxm1 knockout inhibited SCLC formation in the Rb1(fl/fl)Trp53(fl/fl)Myc(LSL/LSL) (RPM) mouse model associated with increased levels of neuroendocrine markers, Ascl1 and Cgrp, and decrease in Yap1. Consistently, FOXM1 depletion in NCI-H1688 SCLC cells reduced migration and enhanced apoptosis and sensitivity to cisplatin and etoposide. SCLC with high FOXM1 expression (N = 30, 57.7%) was significantly correlated with advanced clinical stage, extrathoracic metastases, and decrease in overall survival (OS), compared with the low-FOXM1 group (7.90 vs. 12.46 months). Moreover, the high-FOXM1 group showed shorter progression-free survival after standard chemotherapy, compared with the low-FOXM1 group (3.90 vs. 8.69 months). Our collective findings support the utility of FOXM1 as a prognostic biomarker and potential molecular target for SCLC."

The extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) were identified by thin-layer chromatography and infrared spectroscopy. The fermentation conditions were optimized by single factor experiments in shake flasks and a 5-L fermentor. The results of morphological and phylogenetic tree analysis showed that RM1603 was a strain of Aureobasidium pullulans. Its microbial polysaccharide was identified as pullulan, and the EPS production capacity reached 33.07 ± 1.03 g L(-1) in shake flasks. The fermentation conditions were optimized in a 5-L fermentor, and were found to encompass an initial pH of 6.5, aeration rate of 2 vvm, rotor speed of 600 rpm, and inoculum size of 2 %. Under these conditions, the pullulan yield of RM1603 reached 62.52 ± 0.24 g L(-1). Thus, this study contributes RM1603 as a new isolation with high-yielding pullulan and potential application value in biotechnology."

This work was purposed to study the differences of gene expression at different oxygen supply conditions in Bacillus natto. The differences of fermentation characteristics, gene expression related to MK-7 biosynthesis, spore and biofilm formation were analyzed. The yield of MK-7 increased by two fold under high oxygen supply condition of 200 rpm. Further transcriptome analysis indicated that most of the enzymes in MK-7 biosynthesis pathway were also up-regulated. Moreover, glycerol kinase, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase and phosphofructokinase in glycolysis pathway were all up-regulated indicating that high oxygen supply can increase the consumption of substrate glycerol. Meanwhile, menD, encoded the rate-limiting enzyme in the MK pathway, was obviously up-regulated by 3.49-fold while most of the enzymes related to spore formation were down regulated at 200 rpm. Besides, superoxide dismutase (SOD2), catalase (CAT), hydroperoxide reductase (AhpF) and DNA-binding protein MrgA in the antioxidant defense system were up-regulated, while superoxide dismutase (SOD1) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were down-regulated. These results could contribute to a better understanding for the effect of oxygen on the MK-7 production in Bacillus natto, and further analyze the molecular regulation mechanism of MK-7 biosynthesis."

Coconut, a major plantation crop of the tropics is recalcitrant to in vitro culture with a very low rate of somatic embryo turnover. Clonal propagation to enhance the production of high yielding, disease-free planting material in coconut has remained a distant reality. To better understand the molecular basis of this recalcitrance and to throw light on the complex regulatory network involved in the transition of coconut somatic cells to embryogenic calli, genome-wide profiling of small RNAs from embryogenic (EC) and non-embryogenic calli (NEC) was undertaken using Illumina Hiseq 2000 platform. We have identified a total of 110 conserved miRNAs (representing 46 known miRNA families) in both types of calli. In addition, 97 novel miRNAs (48 specific to EC, 21 specific to NEC and 28 common to both the libraries) were also identified. Among the conserved miRNAs, 10 were found to be differentially expressed between NEC and EC libraries with a log2 fold change > 2 following RPM-based normalization. miR156f, miR167c, miR169a, miR319a, miR535a, and miR5179 are upregulated and miR160a, miR166a, miR171a, and miR319b are down-regulated in NEC. To confirm the differential expression pattern and their regulatory role in SE, the expression patterns of miRNAs and their putative targets were analyzed using qRT- PCR and most of the analyzed miRNA-target pairs showed inverse correlation during somatic embryogenesis. Selected targets were further validated by RNA ligase mediated rapid amplification of 5' cDNA ends (5'RLM-RACE). Our data suggest that a few conserved miRNAs and species-specific miRNAs act in concert to regulate the process of somatic embryogenesis in coconut. The results of this study provide the first overview into the regulatory landscape of somatic embryogenesis in coconut and possible strategies for fine-tuning or reprogramming to enhance somatic embryo turn over in coconut."

Aberrant miRNAs expression is associated with the onset and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between five miRNAs (miR-29a, miR-101, miR-125b, miR-146a, and miR-155), found to be deregulated in tissue samples of CRC patients, and clinicopathological characteristics and histological markers. Analysis of histological markers was performed by immunohistochemical staining of tumour tissues with Ki-67, p53, CD34, and Bcl-2. Our findings revealed a significant negative correlation between miR-29a expression and Bcl-2 levels. Furthermore, high miR-29a expression was associated with a lower incidence of distant metastasis in CRC patients. We observed negative correlations between miR-101 expression and the number of lymph nodes with metastasis, as well as the size of the largest metastasis; miR-125b expression and lymphovascular invasion; and miR-155 expression and mucus presence. Our survival analysis demonstrated that high miR-29a expression correlated with better progression-free survival of CRC patients, underscoring its potential as a prognostic marker.

High-speed micro-milling technology shows great potential in high-precision and high-quality manufacturing of material PLLA, while it usually produces problems such as material burrs and defects. There is few research and analysis on the material removal mechanism and theory in the micro-milling process of polymers, and thus this paper aims to investigate the burr formation mechanism and processing quality in micro-milling process of medical PLLA. Firstly, a novel thermal-mechanical coupled theoretical model was proposed by considering the minimum cutting thickness and cutting-edge radius size effects, which can reveal the plastic flow law during micro-milling process of polymer material. This model was used to calculate the burr width at up and down milling sides of cutting area. Then material characterization and micro-milling experiments on two types of PLLA with different molecular weights were carried out to validate the established theoretical model, and further the micro-milling parameters were optimized to achieve the control of material burr formation and growth. As a result, a cardiovascular stent was fabricated by micro-milling with the optimized parameters (spindle speed of 25,000 rpm, feed rate of 100 mm/min and axial depth of cut of 5 μm), and the stents obtained significantly high surface quality. These results suggest that the proposed theoretical model has great advantages in the high-quality micro-milling of medical material PLLA.

Using three optical sensors with four light sources, WrisTee allows users to measure 12 photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals at three locations on the radial artery. Two types of PPG signals with opposite polarities were discovered and designated as in-phase and invert-phase signals. We provided a unified viewpoint regarding their differences based on the Beer $-$ Lambert law, and showed that both signals can be used for heart monitoring using data analyzed from a selected subject. Using reflective pulse-transition time (R-PTT) and the standard deviation of R-PTT ($\sigma _{R\text{-}PTT}$), we proposed a method for selecting the optimal wavelength to achieve the best quality signal, thus minimizing storage requirements, power resources, and computational costs. We conducted an experiment on ten subjects to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed method. Our results demonstrated that WrisTee is capable of finding the optimal positions and wavelengths for monitoring vital signs. To automatically detect the PPG phases, six machine learning (ML) models were explored to assess their accuracy for PPG-phase classification. The experimental results show that a convolutional neural network can be the best candidate for phase classification. Hence, it can be integrated into WrisTee for noninvasive health monitoring such as heart rate, heart rate variability, or blood pressure.

However, in situ regulation of the mechanical properties of hydrogels is still a challenge, and regular conductive hydrogels will inevitably freeze at subzero temperature and easily dehydrate, which leads to a short service life. Herein, a novel adhesive hydrogel (PAA-Dopa-Zr4+) capable of strain sensing is proposed with antifreezing, nondrying, strong surface adhesion, and tunable mechanical properties. 3,4-Dihydroxyphenyl-l-alanine (l-Dopa)-grafted poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and Zr4+ ion are introduced into the hydrogel, which broadly alters the mechanical properties via tuning the in situ aggregation state of polymer chains by ions based on the complexation effect. The catechol groups of l-Dopa and viscous glucose endow the hydrogel with high adhesiveness for skin and device interface (including humid and dry environments) and exhibit an outstanding temperature tolerance under extreme wide temperature spectrum (−35 to 65 °C) or long-lasting moisture retention (60 days). Furthermore, this PAA-Dopa-Zr4+ can be assembled as a flexible strain-sensitive sensor to detect human motions based on specific mechanical properties requirements.

However, it is difficult to simultaneously manufacture conductive hydrogel-based multifunctional strain sensors with the synergistic properties of reliable healability for long-term usage and environmental degradability/recyclability for decreasing the electronic waste. This work reports a facile strategy to engineer a self-healing, recyclable and conductive strain sensor by virtue of molecular-level multi-dynamic interactions (MMDIs) including Schiff base complexes, hydrogen bonds, and coordination bonds, which were fabricated using a dialdehyde TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl)-oxidized nanofibrillated cellulose (DATNFC) pre-reinforced gelatin nanocomposite hydrogel (gelatin/DATNFC hydrogel, GDH) followed by dipping in an Fe3+ aqueous solution. The MMDI strategy allows synchronous regulation of both bulk and interfacial interactions to obtain exciting properties that outperform those of conventional hydrogels, including extraordinary compressive stress (1310 kPa), intriguing self-healing abilities, and remarkable electrical conductivity. With these outstanding merits, the as-prepared gelatin/DATNFC/Fe3+ hydrogel (GDIH) is developed to be a multifunctional strain sensor with appealing strain sensitivity (GF = 2.24 under 6% strain) and compressive sensitivity (S = 1.14 kPa−1 under 15 kPa), which can be utilized to manufacture electronic skin and accurately discern subtle bodily motions, handwriting and personal signatures. Notably, this GDIH-based sensor also exhibited reliable self-healing properties for long-term usage, environmental degradability and complete recyclability for decreasing the electronic waste. In consideration of the extremely facile preparation process, biocompatibility, satisfactory functionalities, remarkable self-healing properties and recyclability, the emergence of the GDIH-based sensor is believed to propose a new strategy for the development of sustainable-multifunctional strain sensors and healthcare monitoring. © 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry"

People with ASD and/or ID often experience difficulties in emotion processing which can lead to aggressive or self-harming behavior. The use of biocueing (using wearable technology to constantly monitor and provide feedback on bodily changes) shows promise for improving emotion processing and, thus, potentially reducing aggressive behavior in this population. Both qualitative and quantitative methods were used to examine the feasibility and acceptance of Sense-IT, a biocueing application, in a sample of forensic psychiatric patients with ASD and/or ID and their forensic psychiatric nurses. To our knowledge, the current study is the first to examine first-person experiences with biocueing in forensic psychiatric patients with ASD and/or ID. Results show that, in general, participants experienced the biocueing application as positive and are willing to use biocueing. This is an important finding since forensic patients are often unmotivated to engage with therapeutic techniques. An exploration of trends in aggression and self-harm prior to and during the use of biocueing showed no significant changes. Future research should focus on the way biocueing can be implemented in clinical practice. © 2022"

In the last two years, there was an important development of studies that focused on opportunities, perspectives, and problems in this field. The topic is very important because the telemedicine and AI applied to dermatology have the opportunity to improve both the quality of healthcare for citizens and the workflow of healthcare professionals. This study conducted an overview on the opportunities, the perspectives, and the problems related to the integration of TD with AI. The methodology of this review, following a standardized checklist, was based on: (I) a search of PubMed and Scopus and (II) an eligibility assessment, using parameters with five levels of score. The outcome highlighted that applications of this integration have been identified in various skin pathologies and in quality control, both in eHealth and mHealth. Many of these applications are based on Apps used by citizens in mHealth for self-care with new opportunities but also open questions. A generalized enthusiasm has been registered regarding the opportunities and general perspectives on improving the quality of care, optimizing the healthcare processes, minimizing costs, reducing the stress in the healthcare facilities, and in making citizens, now at the center, more satisfied. However, critical issues have emerged related to: (a) the need to improve the process of diffusion of the Apps in the hands of citizens, with better design, validation, standardization, and cybersecurity; (b) the need for better attention paid to medico-legal and ethical issues; and (c) the need for the stabilization of international and national regulations.

Such online telemedicine is usually achieved with the help of sophisticated and advanced wearable sensor technologies. The modern type of wearable connected devices enable the monitoring of vital sign parameters such as: heart rate variability (HRV) also known as electrocardiogram (ECG), blood pressure (BLP), Respiratory rate and body temperature, blood pressure (BLP), respiratory rate, and body temperature. The ubiquitous problem of wearable devices is their power demand for signal transmission; such devices require frequent battery charging, which causes serious limitations to the continuous monitoring of vital data. To overcome this, the current study provides a primary report on collecting kinetic energy from daily human activities for monitoring vital human signs. The harvested energy is used to sustain the battery autonomy of wearable devices, which allows for a longer monitoring time of vital data. This study proposes a novel type of stress- or exercise-monitoring ECG device based on a microcontroller (PIC18F4550) and a Wi-Fi device (ESP8266), which is cost-effective and enables real-time monitoring of heart rate in the cloud during normal daily activities. In order to achieve both portability and maximum power, the harvester has a small structure and low friction. Neodymium magnets were chosen for their high magnetic strength, versatility, and compact size. Due to the non-linear magnetic force interaction of the magnets, the non-linear part of the dynamic equation has an inverse quadratic form. Electromechanical damping is considered in this study, and the quadratic non-linearity is approximated using MacLaurin expansion, which enables us to find the law of motion for general case studies using classical methods for dynamic equations and the suitable parameters for the harvester. The oscillations are enabled by applying an initial force, and there is a loss of energy due to the electromechanical damping. A typical numerical application is computed with Matlab 2015 software, and an ODE45 solver is used to verify the accuracy of the method. © 2024 by the authors."

The electrocardiogram (ECG) has long been a popular tool for assessing and diagnosing cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Since the literature on ECG monitoring devices is growing at an exponential rate, it is becoming difficult for researchers and healthcare professionals to select, compare, and assess the systems that meet their demands while also meeting the monitoring standards. This emphasizes the necessity for a reliable reference to guide the design, categorization, and analysis of ECG monitoring systems, which will benefit both academics and practitioners. We present a complete ECG monitoring system in this work, describing the design stages and implementation of an end-to-end solution for capturing and displaying the patient’s heart signals, heart rate, blood oxygen levels, and body temperature. The data will be presented on an OLED display, a developed Android application as well as in MATLAB via serial communication. The Internet of Things (IoT) approaches have a clear advantage in tackling the problem of heart disease patient care as they can transform the service mode into a widespread one and alert the healthcare services based on the patient’s physical condition. Keeping this in mind, there is also the addition of a web server for monitoring the patient’s status via WiFi.

Currently, most interactive devices are composed of physically connected separate pressure sensors and display elements, which do not conform to the development of miniaturization and high integration. The realization of combining these two functions in one device with a simplified configuration is still only beginning to be explored. Inspired by the two-in-one response of the octopus, which can both sense and visualize stimuli, an integrated hybrid device based on ionic sensing and electrochromic display is proposed for interactive pressure perception. By efficiently reusing the electrodes and ionic gel, the device enables quantitative sensing and direct color changing in response to pressure. Benefiting from its excellent comprehensive performance, the applications are explored and verified, including the interactive perception of pressure information, hiding and display of visual information under pressure regulation, and repeated writing and erasing on flexible boards.

However, the general conductive fibers, a major component of the existing wearable monitoring systems, have a positive gauge-factor (GF) that increases electrical resistance when stretched, so that the systems have no choice but to consume power continuously. Herein, a twisted conductive-fiber-based negatively responsive switch-type (NRS) strain-sensor with an extremely high negative GF (resistance change ratio ≈ 3.9 × 108) that can significantly increase its conductivity from insulating to conducting properties is developed. To this end, a precision cracking technology is devised, which could induce a difference in the Young's modulus of the encapsulated layer on the fiber through selective ultraviolet-irradiation treatment. Owing to this technology, the NRS strain-sensors can allow for effective regulation of the mutual contact resistance under tensile strain while maintaining superior durability for over 5000 stretching cycles. For further practical demonstrations, three healthcare monitoring systems (E-fitness pants, smart-masks, and posture correction T-shirts) with near-zero standby power are also developed, which opens up advancements in electronic textiles by expanding the utilization range of fiber strain-sensors. © 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH."

Importantly, telemedicine, the delivery of health care and/or health information using electronic systems, can deliver primary and specialized health care to geographically isolated patients, who account for nearly 20% of the US population. In nephrology, where a growing discrepancy exists between the geographic location of nephrologists and patients with kidney disease, telenephrology can bridge distance and deliver renal care and education to the isolated. Large nationalized health care systems, for which incentives are aligned to innovate and implement new platforms to deliver cost-effective care, have been at the forefront of telenephrology. These systems include synchronous direct physician-patient care through clinical videoconferencing, and asynchronous modalities such as electronic consultation and video telehealth to educate internists about specialized clinical topics. Large health care organizations are adopting these platforms as standalone services; however, expansion into the private health care system has been limited by reimbursement, regulations, and other issues.

While all digital (smart) inhalers record adherence, these are distinguished by their compatibility with commercial inhalers, capabilities to guide inhaler technique, use of patient-reported outcomes, and user-friendliness for both the healthcare professional (HCP) and patient. Due to the complexity and novelty of employing digital inhalers, collaboration with multiple entities within health systems is necessary and a well-planned integration is needed. For HCPs and patients, cybersecurity and privacy are critical, it will require review by each healthcare organization. In the US, some payers reimburse for remote monitoring using digital inhalers, but reimbursement is currently unavailable in other countries. There are several models for remote patient care, as employing an active, ongoing digital interface between the HCP and patient or they may choose to only review data at clinical encounters. Personalization of therapies and feedback are key to success. While digital inhaler malfunction uncommonly occurs, patient attrition over a year is significant.

Our normative analysis argues for consistently granting patients access to the raw data collected by their implantable devices. Context: Millions of life-sustaining implantable devices collect and relay massive amounts of digital health data, increasingly by using user-downloaded smartphone applications to facilitate data relay to clinicians via manufacturer servers. Whether patients have either legal or normative claims to data collected by these devices, particularly in the raw, granular format beyond that summarized in their medical records, remains incompletely explored. Methods: Using pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) as a clinical model, we outline the clinical ecosystem of data collection, relay, retrieval, and documentation. We consider the legal implications of US and European privacy regulations for patient access to either summary or raw device data. Lastly, we evaluate ethical arguments for or against providing patients access to data beyond the summaries presented in medical records. Findings: Our analysis of applicable health privacy laws indicates that US patients may have little access to their raw data collected and held by device manufacturers in the United States under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Privacy Rule, whereas the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) grants greater access to device-collected data when the processing of personal data falls under the GDPR's territorial scope. The California Consumer Privacy Act, the “little sister” of the GDPR, also grants greater rights to California residents. By contrast, our normative analysis argues for consistently granting patients access to the raw data collected by their implantable devices. Smartphone applications are increasingly involved in the collection, relay, retrieval, and documentation of these data. Therefore, we argue that smartphone user agreements are an emerging but potentially underutilized opportunity for clarifying both legal and ethical claims for device-derived data.

These techniques are mainly based on mechanical differential pressure sensors or turbine sensors which evaluate the lung function of the subject by measuring the ability of the subject to blow and inhale and determine their lung function parameters, including peak expiratory flow (PEF) and forced vital capacity (FVC). In this study, we present a wearable respiratory function testing system called the wearable respiratory spectrometer, which is developed based on dynamic humidity sensing technology. By exploring the principles and quantitative design of respiratory detection and conducting simulations of humidity sensors, we investigate the comprehensive characteristics of the system. According to Darcy’s law, the gas flow measured by the wearable respiratory spectrometer is directly proportional to the pressure difference inside and outside the device, showing that the system follows the differential pressure sensing principle. According to this basis and combining the structural characteristics of the system, we establish a quantitative relationship among PEF, FVC, and the changes in sensor electrical signals. The experimental results validate a linear positive correlation between the maximum rate of relative humidity change inside the spectrometer and PEF. Additionally, the results of simulated moisture volume experiments of the spectrometer show that in the measurement range from 180 to 840 L/min, the indication error of PEF is less than 10%, the adjacent test error is less than 5%, and the frequency response test error is less than 12%, which meet the industry standards for peak expiratory flow meters. Moreover, we compare the spectrometer with traditional portable lung function testing devices in simulated moisture volume experiments at different PEFs (300 to 720 L/min) and FVCs (3 to 6 L) . The results demonstrate that the average indication error of measured PEF and FVC by the spectrometer are about 0.35% and 0.23%, respectively, both are much lower than those of the portable lung function testing devices, thus fully verifying the accuracy and reliability of this system for real-time lung function assessment. Importantly, under simulated free-breathing conditions (PEF from 12 to 24 L/min, FVC from 0.5 to 0.7 L), the changes in the electrical signals of the spectrometer maintain a linear relationship with the moisture volume. Therefore, the wearable respiratory spectrometer can provide the long-term, free, dynamic, and quantitative monitoring of natural and weak nasal breathing. The measured respiratory spectra of subjects have great potential in real-time monitoring of lung function and remote monitoring of respiratory system diseases. © 2024 Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

The Russian Federation has certain socio-demographic and geographical features that make it difficult to provide qualified medical care to the population. The relevance of telemedicine in modern conditions is difficult to overestimate. Telecommunications technologies have significant potential to address the challenges of providing affordable, cost-effective and high-quality health services to the population. Telemedicine uses information and communication technologies to overcome geographical barriers and increase public access to health services. On May 9, 2017, the President of the Russian Federation approved the ""Strategy for the development of the information society in the Russian Federation for 2017-2030"" by decree № 203. Digital healthcare is an integral part of the digital economy. The aim of study is to analyze the regulatory framework for telemedicine support of occupational pathology activities. Materials and methods. The analysis of the development of telemedicine technologies in the Russian Federation is carried out. The legal framework regulating the work of a professional pathologist using telemedicine technologies has been studied. Results. Consultation of the patient or his legal representative by the medical officer are prevention, collection, analysis of the patient's complaints and data of anamnesis, evaluation of the efficiency of diagnostic and therapeutic activities, medical monitoring of patient's condition and decision on the need for face-to-face reception (examination, consultation). The implementation of these measures using telemedicine technologies is regulated by article 36.2 of Federal Law № 323-FZ, which states that remote monitoring of the patient's health and correction of previously prescribed treatment by the attending physician can be carried out after an in-person appointment (examination, consultation). Remote surveillance is carried out on the basis of data about the patient, was with the use of medical devices intended for monitoring human body, and/or on the basis of the data entered into the unified state information system in health care, or public information system in healthcare of the Russian Federation, or medical information system or information system referred to in part 5 of article 91 of the Federal Law № 323-FZ in compliance with, established by the legislation of the Russian Federation in the field of personal data, and compliance with medical confidentiality. Conclusions. It is necessary to implement telemedicine technologies for pre-hospital consultation of patients to clarify the preliminary diagnosis, methods of examination and treatment, and advice on patient management tactics in the long-term period of the disease. The question of using technologies for patient consultation in the ""patient–doctor"" system remains open due to the peculiarities of diagnostic and expert work of professional pathologists, which requires the analysis of a large number of documents provided by various departments (medical organizations of different forms of ownership, the office of Rospotrebnadzor, Medical and Social Expertise (MSE), employer, etc.). © 2020, Institut meditsiny truda RAMN.

Therefore, the reliance on smart commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) implantable wireless medical devices (IWMDs) is increasing among healthcare institutions to provide routine medical services, such as monitoring patients’ physiological signals and the remote delivery of therapeutic drugs. These smart COTS IWMDs reduce the necessity of recurring visits of patients to healthcare institutions and also mitigate physical contact, which can minimize the possibility of any potential spread of contagious diseases. Furthermore, the devices provide patients with the benefit of recuperating in familiar surroundings. As such, low-cost, ubiquitous COTS IWMDs have engendered the proliferation of telemedicine in healthcare to provide routine medical services. In this paper, a review work on COTS IWMDs is presented at a macro level to discuss the history of IWMDs, different networked COTS IWMDs, health and safety regulations of COTS IWMDs and the importance of organized procurement.

Various approaches can be used to monitor BP: in the office/clinic; at home; 24-h ambulatory recording; or with wearable and cuffless devices. Of these, home BP monitoring is a reliable and convenient method, and is recommended for hypertension management by current national and international guidelines. This recommendation is based on evidence showing that home BP is an important predictor of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and kidney disease in patients with hypertension. In addition, lifetime personalized health record (PHR)-based home BP with telemonitoring combined with co-interventions has been shown to lower BP more effectively than the traditional approach based on office BP. Thus, home BP represents a key metric for personalized anticipation medicine, from digital healthcare to digital medicine.

Similar to the European General Data Protection Regulation, in Brazil, the Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados established rules and guidelines for the processing of personal data, including those used for patient care, such as those captured by smartwatches. Thus, in any telemonitoring scenario, there is a need to comply with rules and regulations, making this issue a challenge to overcome. Objective: This study aimed to build a digital solution model for capturing data from wearable devices and making them available in a safe and agile manner for clinical and research use, following current laws. Methods: A functional model was built following the Brazilian Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados (2018), where data captured by smartwatches can be transmitted anonymously over the Internet of Things and be identified later within the hospital. A total of 80 volunteers were selected for a 24-week follow-up clinical trial divided into 2 groups, one group with a previous diagnosis of COVID-19 and a control group without a previous diagnosis of COVID-19, to measure the synchronization rate of the platform with the devices and the accuracy and precision of the smartwatch in out-of-hospital conditions to simulate remote monitoring at home. Results: In a 35-week clinical trial, >11.2 million records were collected with no system downtime; 66% of continuous beats per minute were synchronized within 24 hours (79% within 2 days and 91% within a week). In the limit of agreement analysis, the mean differences in oxygen saturation, diastolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure, and heart rate were -1.280% (SD 5.679%), -1.399 (SD 19.112) mm Hg, -1.536 (SD 24.244) mm Hg, and 0.566 (SD 3.114) beats per minute, respectively. Furthermore, there was no difference in the 2 study groups in terms of data analysis (neither using the smartwatch nor the gold-standard devices), but it is worth mentioning that all volunteers in the COVID-19 group were already cured of the infection and were highly functional in their daily work life. Conclusions: On the basis of the results obtained, considering the validation conditions of accuracy and precision and simulating an extrahospital use environment, the functional model built in this study is capable of capturing data from the smartwatch and anonymously providing it to health care services, where they can be treated according to the legislation and be used to support clinical decisions during remote monitoring. © JMIR Formative Research.All rights reserved."

One of the most important directions in the development of health care in the Russian Federation is the improvement of approaches to maintaining the health of workers. In order to achieve this aim measures are being taken to prevent the development of occupational diseases, ensure the proper quality and availability of medical care in the occupational medicine and the staffing of medical organizations. Particular attention is paid to preventive measures, a healthy lifestyle and its promotion, and the identification of early signs of occupational diseases. The aim of the article is to determine perspective directions for the development of the health care system for workers with harmful (or) hazardous factors and working conditions, including an analysis of volumetric and structural indicators of medical activity as well as existing and developing legal acts regulating medical care for occupational medicine. Materials and methods. The legal acts regulating the health care of the workers, data from scientific research and scientific publications, statistical reports (form No. 30 ""Information about the medical organization""; reporting materials of occupational medicine centers of the Russia's federal constituent entities) for the period 2016-2020 were studied and analyzed. Results. Today measures to improve the legal regulation of the health care of workers are one of the priority tasks of the state. Medical activity in the health of workers consists in carrying out preventive measures (determining a list of harmful and(or) dangerous production factors and work during the performance of which mandatory preliminary medical examinations are carried out upon admission to work and periodic medical examinations; a special assessment of working conditions; mandatory preliminary and periodic medical examinations), examinations of professional suitability, examinations of the connection between the disease and the occupation; medical care in occupational medicine; medical rehabilitation for medical reasons, medical and social expertise, social rehabilitation, spa and sanatorium treatment. In accordance with statistical data 654 occupational pathologists worked in the Russian Federation in 2020. In medical organizations 1961 full-time positions of occupational pathologists were organized, while the number of occupied positions was 1311, i. e. the staffing of occupational pathologists was 66.8%. A downward trend in the staffing of medical organizations with occupational pathologists has been noted over the past few years. Only 18.2% of all occupational pathologists had the highest category; 74% of occupational pathologists do not have a qualification category. The insufficient level of staffing and qualification of occupational pathologists has led to an increase in the burden on doctors and a decrease in the quality of preventive, therapeutic and diagnostic measures. The number of persons subjected to mandatory preliminary and periodic medical examinations amounted to 8.9 and 9.5 million people in 2018 and 2019 respectively. 7.43 million people were subject to inspections in 2020. The proportion of those examined within 3 years (from 2018 to 2020) remains at the same level and ranges from 98.2 to 98.6%. The share of examined persons with temporary/permanent medical contraindications to work in 2019 and 2020 did not change and amounted to 1.4%. In 2018 this index was 1.8%. At the same time the volumetric and structural indicators of medical activity in occupational medicine are poorly understood because occupational diseases are not socially significant and they are not recorded in the Unified State Health Information System. In this regard it is advisable to optimize approaches to statistical analysis: take into account the volumetric and structural indicators of medical activity in the system of protecting the health of workers including examinations of professional suitability and examinations of the connection between the disease and the occupation, mandatory preliminary and periodic medical examinations. Limitations. The study examined the results of a limited number of statistical forms. Conclusion. The regulatory legal acts in the Russian Federation makes it possible to provide workers with high-quality and affordable medical care. Currently, serious work is underway to modernize the legal acts regulating the protection of the health of workers in order to save the health of workers and their efficiency by obtaining and analyzing objective information sufficient to develop evidencebased tactical and strategic management decisions for the prevention of professional, professionally conditioned and general morbidity, reducing disability due to occupational diseases, reducing labor losses due to illness, maintaining working longevity. Volumetric and structural indicators of medical activity in occupational medicine are currently little studied, in this regard it is advisable to optimize approaches to statistical analysis. Special attention should be paid to the quality of staffing of medical organizations: the quality of continuous professional education of occupational pathologists. It is advisable to continue work to increase the availability of medical care in occupational medicine and the effectiveness of organizing mandatory medical examinations including telemedicine technologies and mobile medical teams. Mandatory medical examinations of workers must be carried out including using technical means and medical devices that provide automated remote transmission of information about the health status of workers and remote monitoring of their health status.

In this context, the Internet of Things (IoT) has played a significant role, facilitating connectivity and data exchange between medical devices and healthcare providers. However, while traditional IoT primarily focuses on local connectivity, the evolution towards the Internet of Remote Medical Things (IoRMT) has opened new frontiers in telemedicine, enabling the monitoring and treatment of patients even in remote or hard-to-reach areas. IoRMT represents an integrated approach that leverages advanced communication and sensing technologies to enable the connection and interaction of remote medical devices with healthcare networks. This interconnected infrastructure allows healthcare professionals to monitor patients in real-time, diagnose medical conditions, and provide personalized care, regardless of their geographical location. Through the adoption of wearable sensors, remote monitoring devices, and teleassistance systems, IoRMT offers a wide range of applications in telemedicine. One of the key areas where IoRMT has demonstrated its potential is in the management of chronic diseases. Patients suffering from conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, or heart disease can benefit from regular monitoring and real-time feedback from their healthcare providers, enabling more effective and proactive management of their health conditions. Additionally, IoRMT facilitates the delivery of specialized care in remote areas where access to healthcare services is limited. However, the implementation of IoRMT in telemedicine presents significant challenges, including data security, patient privacy, and the quality of network connections in remote areas. It is crucial to address these challenges through the implementation of advanced security protocols, compliance with data privacy regulations, and optimization of communication infrastructures. In conclusion, the Internet of Remote Medical Things represents a significant evolution in telemedicine, offering innovative solutions to improve the accessibility, efficiency, and quality of remote medical care. Through the integration of advanced technologies and clinical practices, IoRMT has the potential to radically transform the way healthcare is delivered and received worldwide, contributing to the improvement of health and well-being in global communities. © 2024 IEEE."

Then, this world outbreak has brought the need to track patients' positions, especially to verify the respect of quarantine regulations for infected people and for their strict contacts. Moreover, the conditions of elderly and high risk patients should be continuously monitored, minimising, at the same time, the exposure of general practitioners. Among the several solutions available on the market, telemedicine seems to be an optimal support for remote monitoring, limiting the contacts between doctors and patients, and fast reaction to worsening of clinical conditions. Telemedicine platforms can also integrate Global Navigation Satellite System technology embedded in wrist devices, to add new functionalities, useful even when the pandemic is over.

The smartwatch, equipped with WearOS, should have GPS receiver, heart rate sensor and accelerometer and the developed application installed. It randomly collects positions, for patients subjected to quarantine regulations, generating an alarm in case of violation. From the GUI, the user can start fitness sessions, independently or according to the care plan.

As an essential important link in these systems, sensors provide key value proposition and play a pivotal role. Take wearable electronics as examples, the market value of wearable technology has doubled in the past five years. Sensors have provided core functions for many different products during the development of wearable electronics, and they will continue to play a key role in future generation of products. For example, smartwatches and skin patches are built based on the fitness tracking and daily activity data, and are used for medical measurement. Virtual, augmented, and mixed reality devices rely on a set of sensors (e.g. inertial measurement unit, depth induction, force/pressure sensors) to enable users to interact with the content and environment. Moreover, the transition from traditional human-computer interaction to a natural user interface will also depend on further advances in sensors. Other products in different areas, such as autonomous vehicles, air detector, and smart clothing, are similar and depend on a set of core sensors that can interact with the body or the surrounding environment. Some of these sensor systems have been gradually commercialized and expanded to more industrial, agricultural, military, environmental, and safety applications. In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 has also brought increased attention to sensors owing to their promising applications in tracking early onset and potential virus contacts, and remote patient monitoring of isolated patients. In short, the sensor remains a fundamental component of the entire product line, which has been required to be thinner, lighter, smaller, more flexible, and sensitive in the new application systems. Based on the important role of sensors, many preparation methods such as vapor deposition, lithography, nano-imprint lithography as well as printing have been developed. Each technology has its unique advantages and adapts to different scenarios. At the same time, their disadvantages that cannot be ignored also need to be addressed. For instance, chemical and physical vapor deposition methods, including thermal evaporation, vacuum evaporation, magnetron sputtering, and molecular beam epitaxy, can produce high-quality materials and devices with good performance, but these technologies usually require expensive equipment and specific operating environment. Moreover, it is difficult for these techniques to be compatible with flexible substrates and realize low-cost industrialized mass production. In addition, photolithography and nano-imprint lithography are suitable for precision device fabrication. However, they often face the challenges of low processing efficiency, low output, high cost due to the complex processing process, high design cost of mask, and long processing cycle. In comparison, printing is a very attractive technology for low-cost large scale production. But in most cases, the presence of mask limits the precision and resolution of the prepared micro/nano-sized devices. Therefore, with the increasing demand for flexible, wearable, miniaturized, precise, integrated, and customized sensors, the new processing method with higher precision and more flexibility manners is needed to achieve controllable preparation. To meet the developmental requirements of sensors, various processing techniques mentioned above are utilized to optimize and improve the sensor mainly from the aspects of the electrode, sensing material, and whole device. In recent decade, laser micro-nano fabrication has been gradually developed and popular in the field of manufacturing. The laser micro-nano fabrication changes the material state and property through the laser-material interaction and realizes the well-control of shape and property across scales. With the advantages of large processing speed, high precision, strong controllability, easy integration, and high compatibility with materials, the sensor fabricated by laser has ushered in a new development in structure regulation and performance optimization. However, it still faces challenges and difficulties in mass production and efficiency promotion in practical applications. Progress The laser processing technologies for the fabrication of sensors and sensing systems of different stimulus sources are summarized (Fig. 2). Firstly, three laser processing modes widely used in sensor production including laser induced heating, reaction, and delamination are introduced. The convenience and advantages of laser processing compared with those of the traditional processing technology can be clearly understood in the section of laser processing modes (Fig. 3). Then, based on the existing research results, the sensor systems prepared by laser are classified into ultraviolet, gas, humidity, temperature, strain/stress, biology, and environmental monitoring sensors. It is easily found that the advantages of laser micro-nano fabrication are mainly reflected in the following three aspects. 1) Laser micro-nano fabrication has broadened the preparation approaches of electrodes and sensing materials. It can realize in-situ or non-in-situ preparation of conductive electrodes and sensing materials by laser reduction, sintering, annealing, ablation, pulse deposition, laser induced carbonization, and hydrothermal reaction as well as other specific laser processing technologies, which provide alternative strategies for material preparation. 2) Laser micro-nano fabrication simplifies the assembly process of the whole device. The laser direct writing technology can realize in situ selective process in specific areas or specific materials, leading to great convenience for device construction. Moreover, the whole sensor on flexible substrates can even be prepared by one-step laser fabrication through digital design. 3) Laser micro-nano fabrication contributes to promote sensor performance. Sensing material, as a key part of a single sensor, can be modified and regulated by laser processing, thus providing the possibility of performance optimization. With these optimizations and improvements, the sensors become softer, smaller, and more customized and have higher integration. Finally, we also analyze the problems existing in sensors fabricated by laser micro-nano fabrication, such as insufficient researches on laser-material interaction, limited processing accuracy and efficiency enhancement, and low level of device integration. Conclusions and Prospect Laser micro-nano fabrication has gradually become a common and popular technology for sensing system preparation and integration. To sum up, the sensor fabricated by laser still needs in-depth and detailed exploration to promote the development of commercialization and industrialization of the sensor. © 2021, Chinese Lasers Press.

The pandemic has forced treatment providers and facilities to rapidly adapt to address these threats while redesigning their structure to accommodate physical distancing regulations. Digital health interventions can function without the need for physical proximity. Clinicians can use digital health intervention, such as telehealth, wearables, mobile applications, and other remote monitoring devices, to convert in-person care to remote-based care, and they can leverage these tools to address some of the pandemic-specific challenges to treatment.

A mobile user may have access to various access networks in such a situation. On the PC of each user, numerous programs with varied Quality of Service (QoS) requirements can operate simultaneously. It would be advantageous for a multi-interface terminal to use two or more interfaces simultaneously in order to improve performance. However, using multiple networks at once could use up more energy than just using one interface. Therefore, energy use must to be taken into account when analyzing the Flow/Interface Relationship (FIA). This paper presents a novel method for choosing the ideal FIA that achieves the best trade-off between all the characteristics taken into account, dubbed Smart Tabu Search (STS). STS considers user preferences, network circumstances, network expenses, application QoS specifications, and battery life of mobile devices. We use simulations and testbed experiments to validate our concept. Professionals are now able to diagnose and monitor patients remotely because to the growing use of healthcare monitoring devices. One of the most frequent occurrences that affects the reliability of information transmission in any network is congestion, which is defined as the unchecked increase in traffic relative to network capacity. With the use of a mesh network, wireless sensors, and some of the most significant models for vital signs, the article aims to provide a realistic simulation environment for a healthcare system. The simulator environment is a helpful tool for assessing the dependability and effectiveness of the healthcare system in a realistic setting. However, the system is not appropriate for real-time applications due to the sluggish network adaption caused by the end-to-end based traffic regulation decision. In more recent scheduling techniques, additional scheduling factors were taken into account, including the priority order of inserting packets using a fixed priority algorithm based on Priority Queuing (PQ), user-defined. Context priorities, user-defined profile priorities, the applications and devices that are currently active, the number of their direct neighboring nodes, the average link quality, and user preferences. A cutting-edge paradigm for communication called the Internet of Things (IoT) permits online connections between parts from various domains. The traditional healthcare system has a growing need for social resources like doctors, nurses, hospital beds, and health monitoring gadgets, making modern healthcare one of the most alluring IoT applications. In this paper, a design for a small wearable sensor patch that can gauge body temperature, photo plethysmography, and the electrocardiogram (ECG) is given. The suggested sensor patch can be used to constantly estimate blood pressure (BP) based on the pulse arrival time (PAT) without the need for additional cables or equipment because ECG and PPG sensors are combined in one device. Three sensors are used to monitor vital signs, a central board is used to analyze and collect signals, and a power board is used to provide power and charge batteries. The entire set of parts is made with a rigid-flexible construction that permits rapid attachment to the body for applications like remote health monitoring. For specialized measurements of a particular physiological signal (such an ECG), the sensors can be taken out of the main board in order to save power.

Recent years have seen major developments in the field by integrating electronics within engineered tissues. Previously, the most common types of devices integrated into the body used to be pacemakers and deep brain stimulation electrodes that are stiff and non-compliant; the advent of ultra-thin and flexible electronics has brought forth a significant expansion of the field. Recent developments have enabled interfacing electronics onto, into, and within all tissues and organs with minimal adverse reactions. These have introduced the ability to engineer tissues with built-in electronics that allow for remote monitoring and regulation of tissue function. In this review, we discuss the development of technologies that allowed for the formation of tissue-electronics hybrids and give an overview of the existing examples of these hybrid “cyborg” tissues. © 2020 The Author(s)"

The platform, based on a multi agent blackboard architecture, is classified as a medical device according to the current EU regulation. Thus it needs extensive tests before being put into service for the planned clinical trials, which calls for a dedicated simulating and testing environment. Materials and Methods: Coordination in CAPABLE is achieved through the Case Manager, a component able to generate and notify events to other interested agent components. For representing and exchanging health care information we have adopted HL7 FHIR as a semantic interoperability standard. Results: FHIR has been exploited to design a structured history of a real patient affected by renal cell carcinoma. A simulator has been developed for automating the whole testing process represented by specific scenarios of the patient's history. Conclusions: The simulator relies on the events produced by the Case Manager for coordinating the agents. This proved to be effective in checking that the agents reactions to new data showing up on the blackboard comply with the expected behavior.  © 2022 IEEE."

Aside from efficient real-time sensing performances, the wearing experience such as comfort and lightweight are also quite important for human health-care monitoring devices or systems. Effectively regulating radiative heating from human body are of interest for improving thermal comfort with a cost-effective approach. Here, we report a new strategy utilizing carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as both pressure sensing layer and infrared reflector for fabricating multifunctional wearable electronic device. The as-fabricated device based on face to face structure shows ultrahigh sensitivity of 5.22×105 kPa−1 at 0–30 kPa, and 6.06×104 kPa−1 at 30−100 kPa, respectively. Meanwhile, both measured spectra and finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation results demonstrate that such multifunctional devices present an extreme low IR emissivity of ∼ 20 % as well as outstanding self-warming capability. As a result, it not only shows a passive warming effect of 6 °C over the commercial cotton pieces but also exhibits an outstanding Joule heating effect. This approach will promote the development of multifunctional flexible electronic in personal healthcare, thermal regulation and lightweight body armor applications for effective energy savings. © 2020 Elsevier B.V."

The proposed dielectric layer with uniformly distributed interior microporous can not only increase its compressibility and dynamic response within an extended pressure range but also enlarge its contact area with electrodes, contributing to a simultaneous improvement in the sensitivity, response speed, detection range, and structure robustness. Meanwhile, owing to its superior abilities in complex structure manufacturing and dimension controlling, the proposed 3D-printing-based fabrication process enables the consistent fabrication of the porous microstructure and thus guarantees device consistency. As a result, the prepared pressure sensors exhibit a high sensitivity of 0.21 kPa-1, fast response and relaxation times of 112 and 152 ms, an interface bonding strength of more than 455.2 kPa, and excellent performance consistency (≤5.47% deviation among different batches of sensors) and tunability. Encouraged by this, the pressure sensor is further integrated with a wireless readout circuit and realizes wireless wearable monitoring of various biosignals (pulse waves and heart rate) and body movements (from slight finger touch to large knee bending). Finally, the influence law of the feature parameters of the porous microstructure on device performance is established by the finite element method, paving the way for sensor optimization. This study motivates the development of flexible capacitive pressure sensors toward practical application. © 2024 American Chemical Society"

However, the 3D printing of unique architectures and arbitrary shapes could endow the conformal electronic sensors with excellent flexibility and functionality. In this work, the self-poled PENG were successfully fabricated by incorporating the oriented ionic salt-montmorillonite (IS-MMT) co-fillers into poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) matrix and then performing 3D printing. This hence could give the 3D printed PENG the locked interfacial piezoelectric polarization. More importantly, the self-adaptive conformal PENG based on auxetic metamaterial has also been developed, which is beyond the practicability of the traditional 2D PENG. The effect of various architectures of the metamaterial on the mechanical and piezoelectric responses was particularly discussed. The tailoring of the 3D printed cell with metamaterial of serpentine geometries shows the appealing advantages of high sensitivity to structure variation, thus being beneficial for easier regulation of piezoelectric output. When mounted on the joints as a wearable healthcare monitoring device, this 3D printed PENG could accurately detect the movement of muscles, demonstrating its potential in motion tracking and sign-language interpretation. Obviously, this work could provide a new idea for design and fabrication of programmable wearable electronics. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"

This chapter addresses the outbreak of coronavirus and how digital healthcare technologies can help navigate and resolve COVID-19 and future epidemics. As the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-2019) spreads, technological advancements and efforts to control the disease, manage clients safely, and promote teamwork among overburdened health care practitioners designing innovative, efficient vaccines would be critical. This review looks at how various healthcare scientific sectors are assisting in the fight against the pandemic, as well as how innovative implementations are being used to treat or cure illness. An analysis of the technical landscape in the COVID-19 sense enables some tentative reflections about the conditions of technical involvement in fighting this once-in-a-century pandemic. Firstly, unlike previous global health crises, it seems to turn people from monitoring artefacts and epidemiological analysis through information creation topics via self-tracking, information sharing, and digital information flows. Furthermore, even if many of such innovations were not implemented, in a previous medical crisis background, their extensive usage on a world basis raises concern about the extent of mobilising domestic spying techniques on racial equality and also worries about government agencies retaining higher monitoring rates long after the end of the pandemic. Within the recent epidemic framework, advanced technical technologies in data analysis and remote monitoring of the urgent laws that require the immediate termination of human rights and the approval of medical equipment and vaccinations by fast-tracking processes have been implemented. Everyone knows that digital healthcare technologies are progressively being embraced in this field for fighting against the COVID-19 pandemic. This chapter produced an overview to explain all the efforts being made towards this pandemic in digital healthcare tech. Healthcare centres throughout the world are transitioning to the new technologies listed below to help ease their workload, either by increasing the speed diagnostics or allowing physicians to monitor patients who have been virtually quarantined. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

This leads to delayed and uncoordinated movements, and impacts on the patients’ motor performance with reduced movement intensity, increased axial rigidity and impaired cadence regulation. Turning provides privileged insights in postural instability and fall prediction, as it is regularly performed during daily activities, requires multi-limb coordination. The objective of this work was to define a Quality of Movement (QoM) index, inferred from inertial data related to turns, and strictly correlated with the patient's motor conditions, postural stability, and stage of the disease. Such a concise representation finds its main application in the remote monitoring of patients during daily activities at home. We have recorded and analyzed 180° turns in 72 patients, using inertial sensors embedded in the smartphone. We have set up an algorithm for binary classification of patients: mild vs. moderate/severe conditions, according to the Hoehn and Yahr scale of disease progression and disability degree. Our QoM index is defined as the a posteriori probability output by this binary classifier. It exhibits high correlation (r = 0.73) with the clinical score of postural stability, as well as with the average of four clinical scores related to movement impairment (r = 0.75). These results, together with the widespread smartphone use, provide a step in the direction of a practical, objective and reliable tool for PD patients remote monitoring in domestic environment. © 2020 The Authors"

The need for further investigation, monitoring and therapeutic management are advancing practical issues which had not been identified for consideration prior to the pandemic. Using the marketing assessment, we identified the needs of the patients and evaluated the future steps necessary in the short term to meet them. The research found progress made via telemedicine in monitoring and conducting minor decisions (like up-titrating the doses of different medication regimens) in patients with several cardiovascular diseases (heart failure, atrial fibrillation, high blood pressure), as there is a worldwide trend to develop new telemonitoring biosensors and devices based on implantable delivered transcatheter. The worldwide telemedicine trend encourages a switch from small and hesitating steps to a more consistent assessment of the patients, based on high technology and Interventional Cardiology. Cardiovascular telemedicine, although made a sustainable effort in managing patients' health, has many obstacles to overcome before meeting all their needs. Data security, confidentiality and reimbursement are the top priorities in developing remote Cardiology. The regulatory institutions need to play an integrative role in leading the way for defining the framework of future telemedicine activities. The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak with all its tragedy served to reinforce the message that telemedicine services can be life-saving for cardiovascular patients. Once the Covid-19 era will fade away, telemedicine is likely to remain a complementary service of standard care. There is still room to improve the remote identification and investigation of heart disease, provide an accurate diagnosis and therapeutic regimen, and update regulations and guidelines to the new realities of technological progress in the field.
