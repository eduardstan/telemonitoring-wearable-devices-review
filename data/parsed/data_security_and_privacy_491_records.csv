This article presents a novel architecture that integrates PUF, blockchain, and Tangle for Security-by-Design (SbD) of healthcare cyber-physical systems (H-CPSs). Healthcare systems around the world have undergone massive technological transformation and have seen growing adoption with the advancement of Internet-of-Medical Things (IoMT). The technological transformation of healthcare systems to telemedicine, e-health, connected health, and remote health is being made possible with the sophisticated integration of IoMT with machine learning, big data, artificial intelligence (AI), and other technologies. As healthcare systems are becoming more accessible and advanced, security and privacy have become pivotal for the smooth integration and functioning of various systems in H-CPSs. In this work, we present a novel approach that integrates PUF with IOTA Tangle and blockchain and works by storing the PUF keys of a patient's Body Area Network (BAN) inside blockchain to access, store, and share globally. Each patient has a network of smart wearables and a gateway to obtain the physiological sensor data securely. To facilitate communication among various stakeholders in healthcare systems, IOTA Tangle's Masked Authentication Messaging (MAM) communication protocol has been used, which securely enables patients to communicate, share, and store data on Tangle. The MAM channel works in the restricted mode in the proposed architecture, which can be accessed using the patient's gateway PUF key. Furthermore, the successful verification of PUF enables patients to securely send and share physiological sensor data from various wearable and implantable medical devices embedded with PUF. Finally, healthcare system entities like physicians, hospital admin networks, and remote monitoring systems can securely establish communication with patients using MAM and retrieve the patient's BAN PUF keys from the blockchain securely.

The feasibility characteristics for wrist-worn biosensors are poorly described for post-COVID conditions and rural populations. Methods: We prospectively recruited patients in rural communities who were enrolled in an at-home rehabilitation program for post-COVID conditions. They were asked to wear a FitBit Charge 2 device and biosensor parameters were analyzed (e.g. heart rate, sleep, and activity). Electronic patient reported outcome measures (E-PROMS) for mental (bi-weekly) and physical (daily) symptoms were collected using SMS text or email (per patient preference). Exit surveys and interviews evaluated the patient experience. Results: Ten patients were observed for an average of 58 days and half (N=5) were monitored for 8 weeks or more. Five patients (50%) had been hospitalized with COVID (mean stay = 41 days) and 4 (36%) had required mechanical ventilation. As baseline, patients had moderate to severe levels of anxiety, depression, and stress; fatigue and shortness of breath were the most prevalent physical symptoms. Four patients (40%) already owned a smartwatch. In total, 575 patient days of patient monitoring occurred across 10 patients. Biosensor data was usable for 91.3% of study hours and surveys were completed 82.1% and 78.7% of the time for physical and mental symptoms, respectively. Positive correlations were observed between stress and resting heart rate (r=0.360, p<0.01), stress and daily steps (r=0.335, p<0.01), and anxiety and daily steps (r=0.289, p<0.01). There was a trend toward negative correlation between sleep time and physical symptom burden (r=-0.211, p=0.05). Patients reported an overall positive experience and identified the potential for wearable devices to improve medical safety and access to care. Concerns around data privacy/security were infrequent. Conclusions: We report excellent feasibility characteristics for wrist-worn biosensors and e-PROMS as a possible substrate for multi-modal disease tracking in post-COVID conditions.

However, our understanding of the preferences of PD patients for RPM programs remains limited. This study aimed to bridge this gap by eliciting and examining PD patients' preferences for RPM through interviews and a discrete choice experiment (DCE). Methods: A mixed-methods approach was employed to elicit PD patients’ preferences in Finland and Italy. Initially, seven individual semi-structured interviews and five focus groups were conducted, comprising a total of 27 patients. Discussions revolved around three topics: disease detection, current monitoring process, and perceptions about RPM. Building on the insights gained from interviews and focus groups, a 12 choice tasks DCE survey was constructed. The survey also included questions pertaining to patient demographics, prior experience with wearables, and digital literacy. Preferences were estimated using a conditional logit model. Results: Patient concerns regarding data privacy, stigmatization, costs, and device intrusiveness emerged during the discussions. However, potential benefits of symptom control and disease progression management appeared to outweigh most technology-related inconveniences. A DCE was built incorporating five key attributes: effectiveness, monitoring intensity, time commitment for online questionnaires, video recording at home, and out-of-pocket costs for devices purchasing. Initial results (n=7) revealed a preference among participants for more effective RPM interventions (β = 1.15, P=.193) without video recordings (β = 0.90, P=.011). Notably, costs emerged as a significant factor in the preliminary analysis (β = -2.12, P =.002), despite its lesser emphasis in the qualitative analysis. Conclusions: Qualitative findings revealed that patients expressed willingness to embrace RPM if it proves to be effective for symptom and disease progression management. However, initial DCE results indicate that while effectiveness and privacy remain important, the significance of costs is higher than anticipated. These findings are preliminary and require validation through a larger sample size in the ongoing study."

These requirements are fulfilled by portable (wearable) patient devices, with low consumption, which transmit data wirelessly, at a short distance, to a mobile communication device (GSM) and through it, to a remote end recipient - doctor, medical center or a hospital server. The data transfer technology requires the monitored person to perform a sequence of actions, such as: selecting the appropriate application on the mobile phone, establishing a connection between the patient module and the phone, recording the data in the phone's memory, starting the data transfer from the phone to the final receiver. Practice shows that often this sequence of activities is difficult for elderly people and especially for visually impaired people, which as a result compromises the remote monitoring process. In this paper are presented an approach and conceptual implementation of a system for remote monitoring of cardiac activity, using the most popular way of remote connectivity - voice (sound) communication.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory approval documents are often the only available source of information on the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions based on these devices. Objective: To systematically review the publicly available information from the FDA on all recently approved medical devices used in JITIs to (1) assess how they operate to deliver JITIs and (2) appraise the evidence supporting their performance and clinical effectiveness. Evidence Review: Two reviewers systematically searched the Premarket Notifications (510(k)), Premarket Approvals, De Novo, and Humanitarian Device Exemption databases from January 2019 to December 2021 for all entries associated with devices that monitored patients' data over time to personalize the delivery of interventions to treat, prevent, or mitigate health conditions or events. They assessed whether the product summaries (1) enabled an understanding of how the device operated to deliver a JITI (eg, the nature, type, and frequency of the monitoring, the nature of the decision algorithm, and the nature and intended receiver of the intervention); (2) informed about the performance and effectiveness of the JITI; and (3) included information on data security and ownership. Findings: In total, 38 devices were included in this review. These were mainly intended for cardiac conditions (12 [31.6%]), diabetes (10 [26.3%]), and neurological diseases (4 [10.5%]). Monitoring devices ranged from wearable (18 of 28 [64.4%]; eg, smartwatches) to implanted sensors (6 of 28 [21.4%]; eg, inserted electrocardiographic sensors). Only 10 of 38 product summaries (26.3%) allowed a full understanding of how the device operated to deliver a JITI. Similarly, only 12 of 28 (42.9%), 12 of 36 (33.3%), and 5 of 38 (13.2%) reported the assessment of the performance of the monitoring device, assessment of the decision algorithm, and results of clinical studies assessing the effectiveness of the JITI, respectively. Finally, 14 of 36 product summaries (38.9%) included some information on data security, but none included information on data ownership. Conclusion and Relevance: The results of this systematic review suggest that the information publicly available in the FDA databases on the performance and effectiveness of digital medical devices used in JITIs is heterogeneous.."

The COVID pandemic has highlighted the potential safety benefits of post-discharge RPM in the ED, especially in remote/rural settings. This study aimed to determine the feasibility characteristics of smartwatches in health status tracking for post-COVID patients. Measures and Design: This prospective feasibility trial enrolled patients rehabilitating at home from acute COVID in remote/rural Alberta. Patients were asked to wear a Fitbit Charge 2 device continuously and device metrics were extracted for analysis (e.g. heart rate, sleep, and activity). Electronic patient reported outcome measures (e-PROMS) for mental (bi-weekly) and physical (daily) health were collected via SMS text and email. Exit surveys and semistructured interviews evaluated the patient experience. The primary outcome was proportion of time (study-hours) with usable heart rate data. Secondary measures included completion rate for e-PROMs, patient satisfaction, patient-perceived clinical utility and mental health impacts. Evaluation/results: Of 17 eligible patients, 11 agreed to participate. The mean age was 52 yrs and 73% were female. Five patients (45%) were hospitalized (avg. stay 41 days) and 4 required mechanical ventilation; 6 already owned a smartwatch. The most prominent physical symptoms were fatigue, muscle weakness, headache, and dyspnea. On average, patients had moderate to severe anxiety (GAD 7 = 15.8), depression (PHQ-9 = 19.9), and stress (PSS = 26.6). A total of 21,040 patient-hours were monitored, averaging 1913 hrs per patient (SD = 1396). Heart rate data was usable for 83% of studyhours. Surveys were completed 83% and 72% of the time for mental and physical health, respectively. Survey scores were favorable for usability/acceptability (3.9/7), perceived clinical utility (3.5/7) and mental health impacts (3.8/7). Interviews revealed overall positive patient experience with varying concerns about data privacy/security. Discussion/impact: Smartwatches are feasible tools for RPM, especially given their usability, affordability, and patient acceptance. We will present preliminary estimates for longitudinal associations between smartwatch parameters and e-PROMS. Future work will aim to develop tools for predicting and preventing ED visits/revisits with continuously collected smartwatch data and machine learning."

Telehealth prevalence and use increased during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, familiarity with and use of telehealth and health-related mobile applications (apps) by persons with epilepsy remain unknown. Methods: We investigated telehealth use, demographics, and clinical variables within the multicenter Epi2020 cross-sectional study. Between October and December 2020, adults with epilepsy completed a validated questionnaire, including individual questions regarding knowledge and use of apps and telehealth. Results: Of 476 included individuals (58.2% women; mean age 40.2 ± 15.4 years), 41.6% reported using health-related apps. Health apps were used more frequently (pedometer 32.1%, exercise app 17.6%) than medical apps (health insurance 15.1%, menstrual apps 12.2%) or apps designed for epilepsy (medication reminders 10.3%, seizure calendars 4.6%). Few used seizure detectors (i.e., apps as medical devices 1.9%) or mobile health devices (fitness bracelet 11.3%). A majority (60.9%) had heard the term telehealth, 78.6% of whom had a positive view. However, only 28.6% had a concrete idea of telehealth, and only 16.6% reported personal experience with telehealth. A majority (55%) would attend a teleconsultation follow-up, and 41.2% would in a medical emergency. Data privacy and availability were considered equally important by 50.8%, 21.8% considered data privacy more important, and 20.2% considered data availability more important. Current health-related app use was independently associated with younger age (p = 0.003), higher education (p < 0.001), and subjective COVID-19-related challenges (p = 0.002). Persistent seizure occurrence (vs. seizure freedom ≥12 months) did not affect willingness to use teleconsultations on multivariable logistic regression analysis. Conclusions: Despite positive telehealth views, few persons with epilepsy in Germany are familiar with specific apps or services. Socioeconomic factors influence telehealth use more than baseline epilepsy characteristics. Telehealth education and services should target socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals to reduce the digital care gap.

With a growing body of supportive clinical studies, advances in digital inhaler sensors and platforms, greater support from payers and healthcare organizations, significant growth with these technologies is expected. While all digital (smart) inhalers record adherence, these are distinguished by their compatibility with commercial inhalers, capabilities to guide inhaler technique, use of patient-reported outcomes, and user-friendliness for both the healthcare professional (HCP) and patient. Due to the complexity and novelty of employing digital inhalers, collaboration with multiple entities within health systems is necessary and a well-planned integration is needed. For HCPs and patients, cybersecurity and privacy are critical, it will require review by each healthcare organization. In the US, some payers reimburse for remote monitoring using digital inhalers, but reimbursement is currently unavailable in other countries. There are several models for remote patient care, as employing an active, ongoing digital interface between the HCP and patient or they may choose to only review data at clinical encounters. Personalization of therapies and feedback are key to success. While digital inhaler malfunction uncommonly occurs, patient attrition over a year is significant. Some patients will be challenged to use digital platforms or have the necessary technology.

The need for further investigation, monitoring and therapeutic management are advancing practical issues which had not been identified for consideration prior to the pandemic. Using the marketing assessment, we identified the needs of the patients and evaluated the future steps necessary in the short term to meet them. The research found progress made via telemedicine in monitoring and conducting minor decisions (like up-titrating the doses of different medication regimens) in patients with several cardiovascular diseases (heart failure, atrial fibrillation, high blood pressure), as there is a worldwide trend to develop new telemonitoring biosensors and devices based on implantable delivered transcatheter. The worldwide telemedicine trend encourages a switch from small and hesitating steps to a more consistent assessment of the patients, based on high technology and Interventional Cardiology. Cardiovascular telemedicine, although made a sustainable effort in managing patients' health, has many obstacles to overcome before meeting all their needs. Data security, confidentiality and reimbursement are the top priorities in developing remote Cardiology. The regulatory institutions need to play an integrative role in leading the way for defining the framework of future telemedicine activities. The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak with all its tragedy served to reinforce the message that telemedicine services can be life-saving for cardiovascular patients. Once the Covid-19 era will fade away, telemedicine is likely to remain a complementary service of standard care. There is still room to improve the remote identification and investigation of heart disease, provide an accurate diagnosis and therapeutic regimen, and update regulations and guidelines to the new realities of technological progress in the field."

The purpose of this review is to describe the current use of telehealth, mobile applications and wearable devices in inflammatory bowel disease and potential future applications. Recent findings Telemedicine was increasingly used during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic. Virtual consultations allowed clinical care to continue despite pandemic-related restrictions without compromising the quality of care for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It also benefits patients who would not have access to care due to financial or geographical barriers. Mobile applications allow patients with IBD to record disease activity among other metrics, allowing for earlier healthcare provider intervention. Wearable devices are increasingly being explored to monitor physiological indicators of disease activity and flare. Summary Telehealth and remote patient monitoring has been successfully integrated into the care of IBD patients. The advantages of these modalities include better access to specialist care and remote noninvasive disease monitoring. Careful consideration must be given to patient privacy, data protection and equitable access. These modalities have enormous potential to improve patient care through accurate consistent data collection and even the prediction of disease activity."

Made possible since the advent of cloud-connected technologies for diabetes management, such as continuous glucose monitoring systems, the development of telemedicine as part of the standard of care for people with diabetes still faces significant challenges in Europe. Methods: A group of multidisciplinary experts from across Europe participated in an in-depth needs assessment and review of the benefits and challenges to wider access and implementation of telemedicine and telemonitoring in the post-pandemic future. Results: Challenges include: 1) a fragmented approach to healthcare technology assessment and reimbursement; 2) lack of eHealth education and literacy, amongst healthcare professionals and patients; 3) lack of data integration with electronic health records; 4) patient consent, privacy and data protection. To meet these challenges, the following actions were identified: 1) investment in telemedicine and technology that allows remote monitoring; 2) bridge health inequities; 3) protect patient data and privacy; 4) incentivize broad adoption by patients, providers and health systems; 5) ensure a true measure of the value these technologies bring. Conclusions: There is a strong consensus among experts on the challenges that must be overcome to secure access to telemonitoring and telemedicine for the diabetes community. There is a significant need for action across European health policymakers, to move forward in establishing digital competencies and developing sustainable solutions that support wider implementation of digital technologies and telemedicine in diabetes care."

Health care technology is increasingly available to and highly used among AYAs and has the potential to improve cancer care delivery. The COVID-19 pandemic forced institutions to rapidly adopt novel approaches for enrollment and monitoring of patients on cancer clinical trials, many of which have the potential for improving AYA trial participation overall. This consensus statement from the Children's Oncology Group AYA Oncology Discipline Committee reviews opportunities to use technology to optimize AYA trial enrollment and study conduct, as well as considerations for widespread implementation of these practices. The use of remote patient eligibility screening, electronic informed consent, virtual tumor boards, remote study visits, and remote patient monitoring are recommended to increase AYA access to trials and decrease the burden of participation. Widespread adoption of these strategies will require new policies focusing on reimbursement for telehealth, license portability, facile communication between electronic health record systems and advanced safeguards to maintain patient privacy and security. Studies are needed to determine optimal approaches to further incorporate technology at every stage of the clinical trial process, from enrollment through study completion."

Interestingly, no review of attitudes toward telemedicine among older adults has been performed. This is likely to be the group most affected by both cancer and the increasing use of technology in health care. Objective: We aimed to map research on the acceptance of telemedicine among older adults who are cancer patients. Methods: We conducted a scoping review. PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were systematically searched from inception to September 2020. Articles were included if the study population had a mean or median age ≥65 years, with cancer diagnoses and if the study assessed patients’ acceptance of a telemedicine intervention. Quantitative, qualitative, and mixed method studies were included. Results: Out of a total of 887 articles that were identified, 19 were included in the review. Interventions were delivered via telephone, videoconference, web portal, mobile app, wearable technology, and text messaging and included teleconsultation, monitoring and follow-up, psychosocial support and nursing care, and prompts. The most often cited facilitating factor was convenience. Other facilitators included an increase in telemedicine care accessibility, previous positive experiences of telemedicine, appropriate technical knowledge and support, decreased cost, physician recommendations, and privacy conferred by the telemedicine intervention. Barriers include a preference for conventional care along with negative perceptions of telemedicine, concerns about technical difficulties, and confidentiality concerns in the adoption of telemedicine. Conclusions: None of the studies explored the ability of tailored interventions to address facilitators and barriers of the acceptance of telemedicine in order to increase its adoption by older adults. Facilitators and barriers will likely differ across different cultural contexts and by type of telemedicine; however, this is a gap in current knowledge. In-depth studies are necessary to determine if interventions could potentially address the barriers identified in this review, to increase acceptability."
2022,Circulation,10.1161/circ.145.suppl_1.P043,"Danawi, H.; Dunn, P.",A Framework for the Evaluation of Digital Tools,English,"Digital health tools encompass a wide range of technologies that have been used in healthcare services including mobile applications, health information technology, smart wearable devices, remote monitoring and treatment, and health platforms. These tools walk a fine line between lifestyle consumer products and medical devices. Sleep applications can be used by consumers as a fun gadget to track sleep, but it may also be used as a medical tool to collect information concerning serious sleep disorders. The fast proliferation of these tools has put pressure on concerned stakeholders to make sense of this group of technologies. Various questions have been raised within this realm: What counts as medical as opposed to a lifestyle device? Which devices require regulation and under what standards? Which devices are allowed to be used in the medical context? And which are not? And under what conditions? Social scientists have highlighted the complexity of digital health tools that (include both medical and lifestyle characteristics and the difficulties accompanied with classifying these tools for regulatory purposes. In an attempt to do so, several regulatory bodies including the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have revised their existing standards to accommodate the regulation of digital health tools. As such, the FDA published a guidance document on Mobile Medical Applications; this led to various concerns questioning the boundaries between lifestyle and medical digital technologies that were defined by the FDA guidelines, which left a significant number of technologies that were considered to be low-risk, completely out of the FDA oversight and with no required compliance/quality control/effectiveness checks. This prompted many companies to develop hundreds of products that belong to the low-risk category, granting them the ability to ignore FDA regulations. Consequently, there remains considerable concern regarding the quality and safety of these digital health technologies that are being used within the medical context. Clear and well-defined regulation processes are needed to control the development and design of these tools, especially that many lack scientific evidence and data privacy. The framework ought to include a risk-based approach to classify devices for regulation in a way to ensure the safety and effectiveness of all digital health tools throughout their life cycle, even those classified as low-risk. The framework and regulatory process also need to take into consideration the rapid change in digital product development, as processes that extend for a long period of time may become obsolete in supporting decisions about these tools. As these digital health tools become more sophisticated, accessible, widespread, and cheaper, the need for classifying and regulating the sector becomes important, especially with the rapid evolution of these technologies."

A secure transmission of health data is vital for treatment or monitoring purposes. Also, since the patient's information may be easily tracked by other devices, it must be kept safe against misuse and data alteration while being stored. IoT networks are significantly resource-constrained, with low processor capability, memory, and power, making it challenging to perform the expensive operations required by ciphering algorithms. Therefore, they need a lightweight security approach that requires fewer resources.This paper proposes a hybrid cipher method for secure data transmission from IoT healthcare devices. The encryption method combines three cipher approaches,a modified lightweight Salsa20 that uses 16-words (each word is 32-bit). First, a five-dimension chaotic map is applied to generate32-keys with the 64-bit length for each sensing data (block of bits). Second, a random shifting is used on the generated keys to seem like a dynamic key. Third, the exclusive-or operation is applied between a generated key with sensing data and modified Salsa20 words.Fourth, the DNA computing operation used in the proposed method increases security by applying the addition DNA operation between the result of the previous step with random selection word in Salsa20 state after converting them to DNA form. Finally, a hash function called SHA3-256 isapplied on sensing data that is used for data integrity when transferring data to the server. The total sent data are the hash data result, the output of DNA result after converting back to a decimal number, and two random numbers for shifting key and selecting Salsa20 word, respectively. Experiments and results of the proposed Algorithm based on NIST testing show that the proposed algorithms provide security features for data content, including confidentiality, authentication, and non-repudiation, and are compatible with all types of sensors to send secure data to the final administrator."

Remote monitoring technologies (RMTs), such as smartphone applications, wearables, and home-based sensors, can change these periodic subjective assessments to more frequent, or even continuous, objective monitoring. The aim of the RADAR-AD study is to assess the accuracy and validity of RMTs in measuring functional decline in a real-world environment across preclinical-to-moderate stages of AD compared to standard clinical rating scales. Methods: This study includes three tiers. For the main study, we will include participants (n = 220) with preclinical AD, prodromal AD, mild-to-moderate AD, and healthy controls, classified by MMSE and CDR score, from clinical sites equally distributed over 13 European countries. Participants will undergo extensive neuropsychological testing and physical examination. The RMT assessments, performed over an 8-week period, include walk tests, financial management tasks, an augmented reality game, two activity trackers, and two smartphone applications installed on the participants’ phone. In the first sub-study, fixed sensors will be installed in the homes of a representative sub-sample of 40 participants. In the second sub-study, 10 participants will stay in a smart home for 1 week. The primary outcome of this study is the difference in functional domain profiles assessed using RMTs between the four study groups. The four participant groups will be compared for each RMT outcome measure separately. Each RMT outcome will be compared to a standard clinical test which measures the same functional or cognitive domain. Finally, multivariate prediction models will be developed. Data collection and privacy are important aspects of the project, which will be managed using the RADAR-base data platform running on specifically designed biomedical research computing infrastructure. Results: First results are expected to be disseminated in 2022. Conclusion: Our study is well placed to evaluate the clinical utility of RMT assessments. Leveraging modern-day technology may deliver new and improved methods for accurately monitoring functional decline in all stages of AD. It is greatly anticipated that these methods could lead to objective and real-life functional endpoints with increased sensitivity to pharmacological agent signal detection."

To maximise the use of wearable devices in practice, it is important that they are usable by, and offer value to, all stakeholders. Although previous research has explored participants’ opinions of devices, to date, limited studies have explored the experiences and opinions of the researchers who use and implement them. Researchers offer a unique insight into wearable devices as they may have access to multiple devices and cohorts, and thus gain a thorough understanding as to how and where this area needs to progress. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the experiences and opinions of researchers from academic, industry and clinical contexts, in the use of wearable devices to measure gait and physical activity. Methods: Twenty professionals with experience using wearable devices in research were recruited from academic, industry and clinical backgrounds. Independent, semi-structured interviews were conducted, audio-recorded and transcribed. Transcribed texts were analysed using inductive thematic analysis. Results: Five themes were identified: (1) The positives and negatives of using wearable devices in research, (2) The routine implementation of wearable devices into research and clinical practice, (3) The importance of compromise in protocols, (4) Securing good quality data, and (5) A paradigm shift. Researchers overwhelmingly supported the use of wearable sensor technology due to the insights that they may provide. Though barriers remain, researchers were pragmatic towards these, believing that there is a paradigm shift happening in this area of research that ultimately requires mistakes and significant volumes of further research to allow it to progress. Conclusions: Multiple barriers to the use of wearable devices in research and clinical practice remain, including data management and clear clinical utility. However, researchers strongly believe that the potential benefit of these devices to support and create new clinical insights for patient care, is greater than any current barrier.

Objective: We aimed to characterize clinical correlates associated with HR change in the subacute period among patients recovering from AMI. Methods: HR measurements were collected from 91 patients (4447 HR recordings) enrolled in the MiCORE study using the Apple Watch and Corrie smartphone application. Mixed regression models were used to estimate the associations of patient-level characteristics during hospital admission with HR changes over 30 days postdischarge. Results: The mean daily HR at admission was 78.0 beats per minute (bpm) (95% confidence interval 76.1 to 79.8), declining 0.2 bpm/day (-0.3 to -0.1) under a linear model of HR change. History of coronary artery bypass graft, history of depression, or being discharged on anticoagulants was associated with a higher admission HR. Having a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), or hyperlipidemia was associated with a slower decrease in HR over time, but not with HR during admission. Conclusion: While a declining HR was observed in AMI patients over 30 days postdischarge, patients with hypertension, T2DM, or hyperlipidemia showed a slower decrease in HR relative to their counterparts. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using wearables to model the recovery process of patients with AMI and represents a first step in helping pinpoint patients vulnerable to decompensation."

While the benefits of ICMs are clear, current algorithm performance can be improved. The objective of this study is to assess the performance of a novel adaptive atrial fibrillation (AF) detection algorithm and separately programmable atrial tachycardia (AT) algorithm. Methods: A dual-stage detect-and-verify AF algorithm and separately programmable AT algorithm were developed. Sensitivity and PPV across a range of settings were determined in silico by comparison with an adjudicated Holter data set (n = 1966 with 229 patient days). Finally, the ability to improve performance through simulated remote programming was assessed. Results: The dual-stage algorithm detected AF in all true AF patients (76/76) resulting in a patient-level sensitivity of 100%. Episode-level sensitivity and PPV ranged from 97.6% to 100% and 79.1% to 98.5%, respectively. Thirty-six false-positive episodes were observed and 32 (88.9%) of these were corrected with programming changes. Decoupling of AF and AT durations improved PPV from a range of 10%–22% to a range of 95%–100%. Conclusions: AF and AT algorithms were designed with novel features including an adaptive morphology assessment for AF detection and separately programmable durations for AT detection. In silico performance yielded improved PPVs while maintaining high sensitivity across a range of settings. Importantly, programming changes that may be made remotely with this system reduced false positives. These algorithms allow clinicians to individualize arrhythmia detection settings thereby improving data management and reducing clinic burden."

Interview transcripts were analyzed using a mixed inductive and deductive approach. Perspectives among clinicians and patients varied regarding familiarity, educational experiences, and preferences regarding how remote monitoring data are handled. Three key domains emerged including knowledge and understanding, managing alerts, and cost transparency. Within these domains, key findings includedvery limited understanding of how remote monitoring functions and how alerts in particular are handled. These knowledge deficits (both patients and providers) appeared to arise in part from different equipment and platforms among manufacturers, the complexity of the technology, and lack of formalized education in remote monitoring. However, interviewees expressed generally high levels of trust in the technology and care systems supporting remote monitoring. Few respondents described concerns around cybersecurity, but patients in particular did raise concerns about cost transparency and frequent billing. In conclusion, conflicting perceptions around remote monitoring persist and indicate important knowledge gaps despite high trust in the care pathway.

The sensor device measures the patient’s vital sign parameters and sends them to the hospital server, such that the data can be processed and stored in the EMR (Electronic Medical Record) of the patient. The proposed security protocol is based on symmetric-key cryptography and addresses the challenges of anonymity, unlinkability, mutual authentication and perfect forward secrecy. Moreover, it relies on decentralised authentication, avoiding an authentication server to be the single point of attack. Besides offering strong security features, the proposed protocol and implementation take into account that sensor devices are typically constrained with respect to communication bandwidth and computation power. Therefore, these parameters are evaluated in addition to the security analysis of the presented protocol. Our solution gives stronger security guarantees than related work, while featuring a comparable computation overhead and the lowest communication overhead."

As mobile health (mHealth) technology gains universal leverage and popularity, it is becoming more user-friendly for older adults and an adjunct to manage CVD risk and improve overall cardiovascular health. With the rapid advances in mHealth technology and increasing technological engagement of older adults, a comprehensive understanding of the current literature and knowledge of gaps and barriers surrounding the impact of mHealth on secondary CVD prevention is essential. After a systematic review of the literature, 26 studies that used mHealth for secondary CVD prevention focusing on lifestyle behavior change and medication adherence in cohorts with a mean age of ≥60 years were identified. Improvements in health behaviors and medication adherence were observed, particularly when there was a short message service (ie, texting) component involved. Although mobile technologies are becoming more mainstream and are starting to blend more seamlessly with standard health care, there are still distinct barriers that limit implementation particularly in older adults, including affordability, usability, privacy, and security issues. Furthermore, studies on the type of mHealth that is the most effective for older adults with longer study duration are essential as the field continues to grow. As our population ages, identifying and implementing effective, widely accepted, cost-effective, and time-efficient mHealth interventions to improve CVD health in a vulnerable demographic group should be a top health priority."

Despite unwavering levels of cooperation among academia, industry, and policy makers, it can still take years to bring a life-saving product to market. There are some obvious limitations, including lack of blinding or masking and small sample size, which render the results less applicable to the real world. Traditional randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are lengthy, expensive, and have a low success rate. There is a growing acknowledgement that the current process no longer fully meets the growing healthcare needs. Advances in technology coupled with proliferation of telehealth modalities, sensors, wearable and connected devices have paved the way for a new paradigm. Virtual randomized controlled trials (vRCTs) have the potential to drastically shorten the clinical trial cycle while maximizing patient-centricity, compliance, and recruitment. This new approach can inform clinical trials in real time and with a holistic view of a patient’s health.

The recognition of human activities from IoT is an important building block in this context. While the analysis of the generated datastream can have many benefits from a health point of view, it can also lead to privacy threats by exposing highly sensitive information. In this article, we propose a framework that relies on machine learning to efficiently recognise the user activity, useful for personal healthcare monitoring, while limiting the risk of users re-identification from biometric patterns characterizing each individual. To achieve that, we show that features in temporal domain are useful to discriminate user activity while features in frequency domain lead to distinguish the user identity. We then design a novel protection mechanism processing the raw signal on the user's smartphone to select relevant features for activity recognition and normalise features sensitive to re-identification. These unlinkable features are then transferred to the application server. We extensively evaluate our framework with reference datasets: Results show an accurate activity recognition (87%) while limiting the re-identification rate (33%). This represents a slight decrease of utility (9%) against a large privacy improvement (53%) compared to state-of-the-art baselines."

Our analysis of health privacy laws indicates that most US patients may have little access to their own digital health data in the United States under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Privacy Rule, whereas the EU General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act grant greater access to device-collected data. Our normative analysis argues for consistently granting patients access to the raw data collected by their implantable devices. Context: Millions of life-sustaining implantable devices collect and relay massive amounts of digital health data, increasingly by using user-downloaded smartphone applications to facilitate data relay to clinicians via manufacturer servers. Whether patients have either legal or normative claims to data collected by these devices, particularly in the raw, granular format beyond that summarized in their medical records, remains incompletely explored. Methods: Using pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) as a clinical model, we outline the clinical ecosystem of data collection, relay, retrieval, and documentation. We consider the legal implications of US and European privacy regulations for patient access to either summary or raw device data. Lastly, we evaluate ethical arguments for or against providing patients access to data beyond the summaries presented in medical records. Findings: Our analysis of applicable health privacy laws indicates that US patients may have little access to their raw data collected and held by device manufacturers in the United States under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Privacy Rule, whereas the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) grants greater access to device-collected data when the processing of personal data falls under the GDPR's territorial scope. The California Consumer Privacy Act, the “little sister” of the GDPR, also grants greater rights to California residents. By contrast, our normative analysis argues for consistently granting patients access to the raw data collected by their implantable devices. Smartphone applications are increasingly involved in the collection, relay, retrieval, and documentation of these data. Therefore, we argue that smartphone user agreements are an emerging but potentially underutilized opportunity for clarifying both legal and ethical claims for device-derived data. Conclusions: Current health privacy legislation incompletely supports patients’ normative claims for access to digital health data."

Worldwide, government leaders and decision makers are implementing policies to deliver health care services using technology and more so in response to the novel COVID-19 pandemic. It is now becoming increasingly important to understand how established and emerging IoT technologies can support health systems to deliver safe and effective care. The aim of this viewpoint paper is to provide an overview of the current IoT technology in health care, outline how IoT devices are improving health service delivery, and outline how IoT technology can affect and disrupt global health care in the next decade. The potential of IoT-based health care is expanded upon to theorize how IoT can improve the accessibility of preventative public health services and transition our current secondary and tertiary health care to be a more proactive, continuous, and coordinated system. Finally, this paper will deal with the potential issues that IoT-based health care generates, barriers to market adoption from health care professionals and patients alike, confidence and acceptability, privacy and security, interoperability, standardization and remuneration, data storage, and control and ownership. Corresponding enablers of IoT in current health care will rely on policy support, cybersecurity-focused guidelines, careful strategic planning, and transparent policies within health care organizations.

This has increased the need for remote memory clinics, we therefore review the literature, current practices and guidelines on organizing such remote memory clinics, focusing on assessment of cognition, function and other relevant measurements, proposing a novel pathway based on three levels of complexity: simple telephone or video-based interviews and testing using available tests (Level 1), digitized and validated methods based on standard pen-and-paper tests and scales (Level 2), and finally fully digitized cognitive batteries and remote measurement technologies (RMTs, Level 3). Pros and cons of these strategies are discussed. Remotely collected data negates the need for frail patients or carers to commute to clinic and offers valuable insights into progression over time, as well as treatment responses to therapeutic interventions, providing a more realistic and contextualized environment for data-collection. Notwithstanding several challenges related to internet access, computer skills, limited evidence base and regulatory and data protection issues, digital biomarkers collected remotely have significant potential for diagnosis and symptom management in older adults and we propose a framework and pathway for how technologies can be implemented to support remote memory clinics. These platforms are also well-placed for administration of digital cognitive training and other interventions. The individual, societal and public/private costs of COVID-19 are high and will continue to rise for some time but the challenges the pandemic has placed on memory services also provides an opportunity to embrace novel approaches. Remote memory clinics’ financial, logistical, clinical and practical benefits have been highlighted by COVID-19, supporting their use to not only be maintained when social distancing legislation is lifted but to be devoted extra resources and attention to fully potentiate this valuable arm of clinical assessment and care."

Wearable devices targeted at healthcare professionals include ECG patch recorders and vests, patches, and textiles with in-built sensors for improved prognostication and the early detection of acute decompensation. Integrating data from wearables into clinical decision-making has been slow due to clinical inertia and concerns regarding data security and validity, lack of evidence of meaningful impact, interoperability, regulatory and reimbursement issues, and legal liability.

This article discusses different use cases where WHD could be of relevance for dialysis patient care, i.e. measurement of heart rate, arrhythmia detection, blood pressure, hyperkalaemia, fluid overload and physical activity. After adequate validation of the different WHD in this specific population, data obtained from WHD could form part of a body area network (BAN), which could serve different purposes such as feedback on actionable parameters like physical inactivity, fluid overload, danger signalling or event prediction. For a BAN to become clinical reality, not only must technical issues, cybersecurity and data privacy be addressed, but also adequate models based on artificial intelligence and mathematical analysis need to be developed for signal optimization, data representation, data reliability labelling and interpretation. Moreover, the potential of WHD and BAN can only be fulfilled if they are part of a transformative healthcare system with a shared responsibility between patients, healthcare providers and the payors, using a step-up approach that may include digital assistants and dedicated 'digital clinics'. The coming decade will be critical in observing how these developments will impact and transform dialysis patient care and will undoubtedly ask for an increased 'digital literacy' for all those implicated in their care."

The Collaborative Aging Research Using Technology (CART) initiative was introduced to establish a digital technology research platform that could widely assess activity in the homes of diverse cohorts of older adults and detect meaningful change longitudinally. This paper reports on the built end-to-end design of the CART platform, its functionality, and the resulting research capabilities. Methods: CART platform development followed a principled design process aiming for scalability, use case flexibility, longevity, and data privacy protection while allowing sharability. The platform, comprising ambient technology, wearables, and other sensors, was deployed in participants' homes to provide continuous, long-term (months to years), and ecologically valid data. Data gathered from CART homes were sent securely to a research server for analysis and future data sharing. Results: The CART system was created, iteratively tested, and deployed to 232 homes representing four diverse cohorts (African American, Latinx, low-income, and predominantly rural-residing veterans) of older adults (n = 301) across the USA. Multiple measurements of wellness such as cognition (e.g., mean daily computer use time = 160-169 min), physical mobility (e.g., mean daily transitions between rooms = 96-155), sleep (e.g., mean nightly sleep duration = 6.3-7.4 h), and level of social engagement (e.g., reports of overnight visitors = 15-45%) were collected across cohorts. Conclusion: The CART initiative resulted in a minimally obtrusive digital health-enabled system that met the design principles while allowing for data capture over extended periods and can be widely used by the research community. The ability to monitor and manage health digitally within the homes of older adults is an important alternative to in-person assessments in many research contexts. Further advances will come with wider, shared use of the CART system in additional settings, within different disease contexts, and by diverse research teams."

During the COVID epidemic emergency e-prescription system has been a huge help to patients, relatives and caregivers too. In this period the proportion of electronic issued prescriptions exceeded 90% of all prescriptions written. The e-prescription system contributes to the better and faster information of healthcare professionals, supports the well-based therapy decisions, helps preventing and eliminating medication errors. Adverse drug reactions (allergies, interactions, polypharmacy etc.) can be more easily identified with the daily use of this service. Less paper administration can increase the time and quality of patient counseling both at the doctor's and in the pharmacies. Medication adherence can also be simply monitored by pharmacist as well. After patient registration - using social security number (SSN / TAJ) -, written maximum 1 year earlier and/ or by other pharmacy dispensed prescriptions will be also downloadable soon from the central database. These functions and real time data contribute to the implementation of high-quality pharmacotherapy advising services in pharmacies as healthcare institutions, made in accordance with the specific standards and protocols. The new functions of the Patient Portal (e.g. Legal Representation) and mobile surfaces provide patients and their relatives access to follow their care process, prescriptions, labs, etc., already on their smartphone too. From the beginning of May 2020, serial-produced medical aids mostly sold in pharmacies, can be electronically issued. The full integration of all the medical aids may be completed next year in a separated module. A simple web-based prescriber (socalled miniHIS) has been developed for connected private doctors, who do not consult in institutions. Measured values of the (smart) medical devices can be uploaded into the personal data repository of the Patient Portal on a voluntary basis. Good measurement results of the blood pressure, sugar, body weight, etc. recorded here demonstrate therapy fidelity, providing feedback to the patient and professionals. Telemonitoring services can be build on this module, so the software can send alerts to the assigned doctor, pharmacist or family member. Keeping data protection rules strict, depersonalized pharmacotherapy data uploaded to the central eHealth database will be searchable soon for professional and scientific purposes."

The healthcare monitoring system is widely used for various purposes in the current scenario. The fetal measurement and fetal diagnosing can be done using Internet of Things based Health Care Monitoring Systems. An accelerometer sensor can only measure the outside movement of the body and it is not able to measure internal body movements. The measurement can be done only in one, two and three orthogonal axes (3D direction). An accelerometer sensor can be used for fetal movement measurement by only giving a high-frequency range. When the high frequency is given, the object should be at rest to control the resting condition, it shouldn't move at least for one inch. The fetal movement can be only done in the month of 9th or 10th month. The vibration of fetal heartbeat can be noticed. But the proper output is not obtained practically yet. This paper discuss the work related to appropriate selection of the sensor and programming which provides accurate movement of the fetal and the distance. The newly developed equipment with ultrasound sensor and proximity sensor are used to identify the distance of fetus and mother skin and the size of the fetus, respectively. All these can be measured during the every month of pregnancy. With the support of raspberry Pi, the general working functions of the equipment can improve the speed of the output. The expected conclusion is an ideal ultrasound sensor programmed with raspberry pi which determines/predicts the working function of fetus, and can be so called as fetus monitoring system."

Heydari,A New Security Framework for Remote Patient Monitoring Devices,,"Digital connectivity is fundamental to the health care system to deliver safe and effective care. However, insecure connectivity could be a major threat to patient safety and privacy (e.g., in August 2017, FDA recalled 465,000 pacemakers because of discovering security flaws). Although connecting a patient's pacemaker to the Internet has many advantages for monitoring the patient, this connectivity opens a new door for cyber-attackers to steal the patient data or even control the pacemaker or damage it. Therefore, patients are forced to choose between connectivity and security. This paper presents a framework for secure and private communications between wearable medical devices and patient monitoring systems. The primary objective of this research is twofold, first to identify and analyze the communication vulnerabilities, second, to develop a framework for combating unauthorized access to data through the compromising of computer security. Specifically, hiding targets from cyber-attackers could prevent our system from future cyber-attacks. This is the most effective way to stop cyber-attacks in their first step."

Rahman,A Patient Centric Agent Assisted Private Blockchain on Hyperledger Fabric for Managing Remote Patient Monitoring,,"Recently, during the COVID-19 situation, the requirement and importance of tracking patients from a remote location have increased significantly. Most patients now prefer to obtain their doctor’s care and check their health status through their mobile phone call, Skype, Facebook Messenger, or other online resources. There is, however, a major concern about the privacy of patients when using online resources. Patients usually choose to keep their information confidential, which should be only accessible to authorized individuals. The most current remote patient monitoring system is organization-centric and patient’s privacy and security rely on healthcare providers’ mercy. Blockchain technologies have attracted the attention of researchers for designing eHealth applications to provide patients with secure and privacy-preserving health services. Blockchain researchers have recently proposed some models for remote patient monitoring systems. However, most of those researchers have applied public blockchains where health data is available to all participants with the property of data tamper-proof. In this paper, we propose a novel remote patient monitoring model using a decentralized private blockchain to protect patient’s privacy and increase the system’s efficiency. The private blockchain will be implemented on Hyperledger Fabric where a Patient-centric Agents (PCA) manage patient’s data and coordinate authorization to form a secure channel to transmit data to the private blockchain. A hybrid consensus by combining Proof of Integrity (PoI) and Proof of Validity (PoV) is used to protect data privacy and integrity when retrieving data from a blockchain-based cloud database. Finally, the Merkle Tree algorithm was used for data processing and authentication when collecting data and uploading it to a cloud database."

This kind of patient medical data is collected by the mean of Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT) or sometimes denoted as Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices. The collected data needs to be stored and retrieved with highly assured levels of security and privacy as the data comprises private and critical patients’ information. To secure medical data, this paper proposes a blockchain-based architecture to manage access control to medical data and to preserve patient’s data privacy. The blockchain-based system is built on Hyperledger Fabric, a permissioned distributed ledger solution, and the ledgers and transactions are stored in the cloud. The proposed architecture is designed to contribute to the robustness of the RPM systems and to avoid recorded security limitations in commonly used permissioned blockchains methods. Performance evaluation has proved the robustness and superiority of the proposed system in terms of data confidentiality, integrity, availability, traceability, scalability, and data privacy while integrated with the RPM services."

One such neuro-degenerative disorder is Parkinson’s Disease (PD). It is categorized by motor symptoms that affect a patient’s motor skills and non-motor symptoms that affect the general health of a PD patient. The quality of life of a patient with PD is highly compromised. To date, there is no cure for the disease, but early intervention and assistive care can help a PD patient to perform daily activities with considerable ease. Many research works in PD management discuss the challenges that healthcare professionals face in the early detection and management of this disease. Sensor devices have been promising to overcome these challenges to a certain degree because of the low cost and accuracy in measurement, yielding precise conclusive results to detect, monitor, and manage PD. This paper presents a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) that provides an in-depth analysis of the PD symptoms, Motor and Non-Motor Symptoms (NMS), the current diagnosis and management techniques used and their efficacy. The paper also highlights the work of various researchers in wearable sensors and their proposals to improve the quality of life of a PD patient by diagnosing, monitoring, and managing PD symptoms remotely via wearable sensors. Another area of focus is commercially available wearables for PD management and a few promising works in progress. This paper will be beneficial for future researchers to identify existing gaps and provide the clinicians better insight into the disease progression, and avoid complications. This paper analyzes around 50+ articles from 2016 to 2021 and concludes that there is still much room for improvement in wearables for PD management during the research process.

Spachos,Fog and IoT-based Remote Patient Monitoring Architecture Using Speech Recognition,,"Health care services have become a high demand due to the rise in medical technology. As a result, related resources are being depleted. Hospitals no longer have any space to accommodate for incoming patients. Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) is a solution to this issue by creating a convenient and easy to access healthcare service. However, RPM systems are constrained by concerns on patient privacy, response time, and patient-service interaction. Patients emphasize their privacy, which requires health care services to maintain the confidentiality of their patient’s information. Wearable health monitors continuously transmit data. This feature results in high volumes of data transmissions towards the servers. In the current state of wearable devices, there is a lack of giving the patient an integrated means of interacting with the healthcare centre and vice versa. In this paper, we propose an architecture that uses fog computing and Internet of Things (IoT) devices to an already existing RPM system and addresses these challenges. The introduced system enables the health care providers to verify any of their data through a local server before it is reported to the main server. Also, this design incorporates a data filter that controls the outgoing data to maintain patient privacy. Finally, the inclusion of a local server offloads the extra data processing that is required from the server for a better flow of data. Tests in latency were executed to investigate the feasibility of a scalable fog architecture against a standard cloud-device setup. The results show that the proposed fog setup yielded significantly lower latencies under an increasing number of RPM rooms compared to the cloud setup. Results further support the fog and IoT-based architecture as a potential option for a scalable RPM."

We have introduced a Real-Time Distant Healthcare Monitoring IoT System (RTDHMIS) which protects the patient data using a lightweight block cipher BEST -1 (Better Encryption Security Technique-1). Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN) comprise many sensor nodes, which are implanted in the patient's body for data collection. Since wearable sensor nodes are resource-constrained devices, it is essential to use a lightweight cryptographic algorithm for data protection. The block cipher BEST -1 provides a good security mechanism against many known security attacks. The security and efficiency of the newly introduced system are compared with related systems and it is found that the performance of RTDHMIS is better for implementation in a healthcare environment."

Tosun,Hierarchical Federated Learning based Anomaly Detection using Digital Twins for Smart Healthcare,,"Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is becoming ubiquitous with a proliferation of smart medical devices and applications used in smart hospitals, smart-home based care, and nursing homes. It utilizes smart medical devices and cloud computing services along with core Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to sense patients' vital body parameters, monitor health conditions and generate multivariate data to support just-in-time health services. Mostly, this large amount of data is analyzed in centralized servers. Anomaly Detection (AD) in a centralized healthcare ecosystem is often plagued by significant delays in response time with high performance overhead. Moreover, there are inherent privacy issues associated with sending patients' personal health data to a centralized server, which may also introduce several security threats to the AD model, such as possibility of data poisoning. To overcome these issues with centralized AD models, here we propose a Federated Learning (FL) based AD model which utilizes edge cloudlets to run AD models locally without sharing patients' data. Since existing FL approaches perform aggregation on a single server which restricts the scope of FL, in this paper, we introduce a hierarchical FL that allows aggregation at different levels enabling multi-party collaboration. We introduce a novel disease-based grouping mechanism where different AD models are grouped based on specific types of diseases. Furthermore, we develop a new Federated Time Distributed (FEDTIMEDIS) Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) approach to train the AD model. We present a Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) use case to demonstrate our model, and illustrate a proof-of-concept implementation using Digital Twin (DT) and edge cloudlets."

According to World Health Organization (WHO), in Pakistan, cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are leading cause of deaths that amount to nearly 200,000 deaths annually. This results in high mortality rates all over Pakistan. To uplift the current architecture of healthcare in Pakistan, it is vital to develop a sustainable solution for continuous health monitoring and arrest anomalous physiological behavior before they become life-threatening. In the same pretext, this study proposes a working paper which aims to disseminate interim results of smart cardiac health monitoring using an amalgam of IoMT and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The primary objective of the proposed research is to integrate state-of-the-art ML classification algorithms to detect, in near real-time, abnormal human vitals like electrocardiogram(ECG), heart-rate(HR), blood pressure(BP), etc. As network latency is critical to this application, therefore, to improve overall Quality of Service (QoS) of the system, we propose to fuse Edge Intelligence interfaced with multiple IoMT enabled bio-sensors. These sensors will form a body area sensor network(BSN) that records cardiac-related human vitals. In our preliminary research, that is presented in this paper, we trained several machine learning algorithms on the MIMIC-III clinical data-set and reviewed their performance. Among the 7 tested supervised classification algorithms, Random-Forest achieved the highest accuracy of 95% on the test set.

On the other hand, it is faced with two main challenges: First, high communication cost, and second, low model quality due to imbalanced or nonindependent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. In this article, we propose FedVAE, an FL framework based on variational autoencoder (VAE) for remote patient monitoring. FedVAE contains two lightweight VAEs: one for projecting data onto a lower dimensional space with similar distribution so as to alleviate the issues of excessive communication overhead and slow convergence rate caused by non-IID data, and the other for shunning training bias due to imbalanced data distribution through generating minority class samples. In general, the proposed FedVAE can improve the overall performance of FL models while consuming only a small amount of communication bandwidth. The experimental results show that the area under the curve (AUC) value of FedVAE can reach 0.9937, which is even higher than that of the traditional centralized model (0.9931).

One typical advantage of DT is that it can be used to not only virtually replicate a system’s detailed operations but also analyze the current condition, predict the future behavior, and refine the control optimization. Although DT has been widely implemented in various fields, such as smart manufacturing and transportation, its conventional paradigm is limited to embody non-living entities, e.g., robots and vehicles. When adopted in human-centric systems, a novel concept, called human digital twin (HDT) has thus been proposed. Particularly, HDT allows in silico representation of individual human body with the ability to dynamically reflect molecular status, physiological status, emotional and psychological status, as well as lifestyle evolutions. These prompt the expected application of HDT in personalized healthcare (PH), which can facilitate the remote monitoring, diagnosis, prescription, surgery and rehabilitation, and hence significantly alleviate the heavy burden on the traditional healthcare system. However, despite the large potential, HDT faces substantial research challenges in different aspects, and becomes an increasingly popular topic recently.

We investigate user re-identification risk in a corpus of such data collected to observe the interplay between behavior, physiology, and well-being of healthcare workers in their daily life. We then develop a user anonymization approach that preserves well-being information (i.e., anxiety), but eliminates user identify (ID) information. We formulate this via an auto-encoder that learns a transformed version of the original feature set in an adversarial manner so that it minimizes the anxiety estimation loss and maximizes the user classification loss. Results indicate that the original features bear a large user re-identification risk, while also having a good ability to classify a user’s anxiety. After removing the most prone features to user re-identification from the original feature set, the user classification accuracy decreases, while the anxiety classification performance is preserved. The final features transformed via the auto-encoder further reduce evidence of user ID and preserve anxiety classification ability. Findings from this study can contribute to the design privacy-aware bio-behavioral models that can be used for responsible ambulatory monitoring in healthcare and beyond."

Incorporating semantics in scene understanding has led to a deep understanding of human-centric actions. Therefore, in this research work, we propose a semantic HOI recognition system based on multi-vision sensors.

It is remarkably intricate to diagnose HD with disparate symptoms or features. With the augmentation in popularity of smart wearable gadgets, a chance to render an Internet of Things (IoT) solution has turned out to be more. Unfortunately, the survival rates are low for the people suffering from sudden heart attacks. Consequently, a patient monitoring scheme intended for heart patients utilizing IoT centered Deep Learning Modified Neural Network (DLMNN) is proposed to assist in the HD diagnosis, and medication is given accordingly. This proposed technique is executed via `3' steps: I) Authentication, ii) Encryption, and iii) Classification. First, by utilizing the substitution cipher (SC) together with the SHA-512, the heart patient of the specific hospital is authenticated. Subsequently, the wearable IoT sensor device, which is fixed to the patient's body, concurrently transmits the sensor data to the cloud. This sensor data is encrypted and securely transmitted to the cloud utilizing the PDH-AES technique. After that, the encrypted data is finally decrypted, and by employing the DLMNN classifier, the classification is done. The classified outcomes comprise `2'types of data: i) normal and ii) abnormal. It denotes the patient's heart condition and if the outcome is abnormal, an alert text is passed to the physician for treating the patient. The investigational outcomes are estimated and the DLMNN for HD diagnosis shows improvement as compared to existing algorithms. Additionally, the proposed PDH-AES used in support of secure data transmission results in the highest level of security i.e. 95.87%, and it is achieved in the lowest time for encryption along with decryption when weighted against the existent AES."

As people get older, multimorbidity—the simultaneous occurrence of many chronic conditions becomes more common. Health systems around the world struggle to adapt to the great range of physical and mental abilities of older people and to encourage good trajectories of healthy aging from an early age. The abilities of an older person can change quickly—in some circumstances, over the course of hours. Care systems struggle to adapt rapidly enough to meet a person's changing demands. As a result of the impending lack of healthcare workers qualified to provide for senior citizens, adopting elder-friendly technologies may level the playing field in the industry.

The neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) requires accurate, real-time monitoring of newborn infants' vital health parameters. One of the challenges encountered by the majority of hospitals is the lack of systems that can track real-time health parameters and notify doctors and parents to indicate any neonatal critical conditions. This research article presents a framework that incorporates IoT, fog, deep learning technologies, Blockchain, and decentralized cloud for NICU newborn health monitoring. The development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain technologies provides wide opportunities for enhancing the data management of neonatal intensive care units. By integrating IoT devices comprising wearable sensors and smart monitors the system gets real-time data on vital signs like heart rate, temperature, blood oxygen levels, and breathing rate. Fog computing is used for the instantaneous analysis of critical data, and an efficient deep learning algorithm will be implemented at the fog layer to classify data into either critical or non-critical data. Since fog has limited resources, a private blockchain is used to store critical data. The critical data is stored temporarily on a private blockchain and permanently on a decentralized cloud."

Traditional security measures are unable to protect data from harmful attackers. Patients' privacy may be endangered as a result of eavesdropping, and the diagnosis of life-threatening diseases may be delayed as a result of IoMT device malfunction caused by attacks such as Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Blockchain has emerged as a possible answer to these problems. The benefits of adopting blockchain based into the healthcare ecosystem include decentralisation, dependability, efficiency, security, and privacy, to name a few. Biometric systems have been rapidly gaining traction in a variety of industries in recent years, and they continue to provide enhanced security for access control systems. In comparison to traditional procedures, security methods based on biometric features give more trustworthiness while requiring less processing.

Massive data collected by medical and healthcare monitoring sensors in the IoMT involves sensitive patient information. It brings some security challenges to validate the legitimacy of participating entities and protect patient data privacy. A certificateless signcryption (CLSC) scheme combines encryption and signature that can offer authenticity, confidentiality, and unforgeability, providing a viable solution to the data privacy issue of the IoMT. However, existing CLSC schemes fail to meet confidentiality or unforgeability, or require expensive computation overhead to perform pairing operations. This article first presents a new CLSC scheme for secure data transmission and better smart services in IoMT, which replaces the signature part with the Schnorr signature. We then give a thorough security proof under the random oracle model. Besides, we elaborately evaluate the performance and security of some existing solutions with our solution. Finally, the experiment results indicate that our solution can achieve a better balance between security and performance than some existing schemes. Therefore, in terms of feasibility, our scheme is more suitable for the IoMT scenario."

The technology has use cases in any industry that generates and transfers data. In a use case such as cryptocurrency the blockchain is used to manage transactions from peer-to-peer in a way that does not allow for that transaction's data to be manipulated by one of the involved parties or a third party. This is a valuable process that other industries could leverage. One such industry that could benefit from applying blockchain technology for a multitude of cases is the healthcare industry. Primary care doctors could be connected to a blockchain system that allowed them to access patient data and securely monitor the respective patient, pharmaceutical companies could increase their products validity in the marketplace with individual product tracking, and the insurance industry could trust all the information about a client. All of these are possible use cases for blockchain in the healthcare industry. Currently, the healthcare industry is not leveraging the blockchain at scale.

IoT-based healthcare applications are employed in the medical centers to provide continuous health monitoring of a patient. However, recent smart medical devices have limited resources to handle the huge amount of healthcare data. IoMT faces several challenging issues, like security, privacy, anonymity, and interoperability. In data aggregation and communication, the privacy and security of medical information is a demanding task. Therefore, we proposed a suitable scheme to overcome the limitations of existing research studies. This paper presents an Efficient and Secure Data Transmission and Aggregation (ESDTA) scheme to enhance aggregation efficiency and data security. Our proposed work provides secure data aggregation and data forwarding of healthcare parameter values by employing the Secure Message Aggregation (SMA) algorithm and Secure Message Decryption (SMD) algorithm at the Mobile Node (MN) and Fog Node (FN), respectively. From a security perspective, the proposed scheme preserves the data integrity and also protect against several security threats like data fabrication and replay attack. The proposed scenario is simulated through simulation tool NS 2.35. The simulation results prove that aggregation at the MN effectively reduces transmission and communication costs. Furthermore, the effective computation at the FN minimizes the storage and computational cost at the cloud server. Thus, the analysis of the proposed scheme shows the supremacy of our proposed work.

The ability to connect devices and collect data from them has the potential to transform the way it monitors and treat patients. However, the security and privacy of this data is a major concern.

The SMP protocol uses a combination of trust, cryptographic, and machine learning techniques to provide security and privacy for data in transit. The SMP protocol has been designed to work with the smart health care monitoring system to provide a secure and private communication channel between devices in the system. The SMP protocol is an improvement over the existing security and privacy protocols for medical data.

However, there is a risk of incorrect diagnosis when data is tampered with from the cloud or a hospital due to third-party storage services. Most of the existing systems use an owner-centric data integrity verification mechanism, which is not computationally feasible for lightweight wearable-sensor systems because of limited computing capacity and privacy leakage issues. In this regard, we design a 2-step Privacy-Preserving Multidimensional Data Stream (PPMDS) approach based on a cloudlet framework with an Uncertain Data-integrity Optimization (UDO) model and Sparse-Centric SVM (SCS) model. The UDO model enhances health data security with an adaptive cryptosystem called Cloudlet- Nonsquare Encryption Secret Transmission (C-NEST) strategy by avoiding medical disputes during data streaming based on novel signature and key generation strategies. The SCS model effectively classifies incoming queries for easy access to data by solving scalability issues. The cloudlet server measures data integrity and authentication factors to optimize third-party verification burden and computational cost. The simulation outcomes show that the proposed system optimizes average data leakage error rate by 27%, query response time and average data transmission time are reduced by 31%, and average communication-computation cost are reduced by 61% when measured against state-of-the-art approaches."

However, due to their strict computational, energy and physical constraints, conventional security protocols are not directly applicable to IMDs. Custom-tailored schemes have been proposed instead which, however, fail to cover the full spectrum of security features that modern IMDs and their ecosystems so critically require. In this paper we propose IMDfence, a security protocol for IMD ecosystems that provides a comprehensive yet practical security portfolio, which includes availability, non-repudiation, access control, entity authentication, remote monitoring and system scalability. The protocol also allows emergency access that results in the graceful degradation of offered services without compromising security and patient safety. The performance of the security protocol as well as its feasibility and impact on modern IMDs are extensively analyzed and evaluated. We find that IMDfence achieves the above security requirements at a mere less than 7% increase in total IMD energy consumption, and less than 14 ms and 9 kB increase in system delay and memory footprint, respectively."

Telemedicine platforms can be employed in this field, to reduce the number of hospital admissions and check-ups and to improve the communication between parents/caregivers and the hospital staff. The aim of the AIR CARDIO project is to evaluate the impact, efficiency and effectiveness of a home telemonitoring system for children with congenital heart disease. The vital signs (i.e. ECG, heart rate, body temperature, body weight and oxygen saturation) are collected by some biomedical sensors and sent to a smart-hub. The smart-hub proceeds then to the synchronization with the e-Health care center, enabling the doctors to evaluate the patient’s parameters. Some questionnaires are also provided to parents/caregivers through the application, for the evaluation of the effects of the system on quality of life. In the clinical trial, which lasts 12 months, 45 patients are recruited from the U.O.C. Paediatric and Adult Congenital Cardiology - Monasterio Foundation. Preliminary results highlight suitability of the sensors selected for children and good usability of the smart-hub technology."

The concept of the framework is a breakthrough in the state of medical, scientific and technological art, aimed at engaging patients in the treatment plan and supporting interaction with healthcare professionals. The proposed platform is able to support a new paradigm for the management of patients with COPD, by integrating clinical data and parameters monitored in daily life using Artificial Intelligence algorithms. Therefore, the doctor is provided with a dynamic picture of the disease and its impact on lifestyle and vice versa, and can thus plan more personalized diagnostics, therapeutics, and social interventions. This strategy allows for a more effective organization of access to outpatient care and therefore a reduction of emergencies and hospitalizations because exacerbations of the disease can be better prevented and monitored. Hence, it can result in improvements in patients' quality of life and lower costs for the healthcare system."

Although mHealth can improve patients' quality of health by offering outpatient real-time health monitoring systems instead of being stuck in the hospital all the time to monitor chronic diseases. The major challenge in adopting mHealth is data security and privacy. The health data routed on the internet from the patient monitoring device to the health center for remote monitoring is vulnerable to confidentiality attacks. To handle this issue, we present an authentication scheme based on non-interactive zero-knowledge proof (NIZKP), which issues certificates and authenticates monitoring devices each time performing transactions without revealing sensitive information. Our authentication scheme provides a high level of security with a low computational cost, which is lightweight for WBANs."

The healthcare industry is one significant field of research where the concept has been adopted. Health services are extraordinarily expensive for the individuals who need them, and this is particularly true in developing nations. As a consequence, this research is an effort to address a contemporary healthcare issue in society. The creation of a remote healthcare system was the project’s principal goal. There are three primary components to it. The first step involved employing sensors for detecting the patient’s vital signs, the second involved transmitting the data to cloud storage, and the final step involved making the detected information available for enabling remote visuals. A doctor or caretaker can remotely access the data and track a patient’s health improvement from a location other than the hospital. The Internet of Things (IoT) principles have been widely applied to connect the available medical resources and provide patients with intelligent, dependable, and efficient healthcare. Among the ideas that can harness the benefits of the IoT to enhance the sufferer’s lifestyle is health monitoring for dynamic and supported living. We have provided an IoT system that has been specially designed for smart healthcare in this project. The proposal’s goal was to develop a Remote Health Monitoring System that could be created using readily accessible local sensors in order to keep costs low if it were to be mass produced. As a result, the presented architecture gathers sensor data using an Arduino microcontroller and transmits it to the cloud for processing and analysis before being made available for remote viewing. In the event of any emergencies, corrective actions depending on the evaluated data can be communicated back to the doctor or guardian by email and SMS notifications."

Such individuals require continuous monitoring to ensure the stability of their condition and prevent complications. However, traditional methods of patient monitoring can be invasive, time-consuming, and often result in patients feeling limited in their daily activities. The development of intelligent monitoring systems based on Internet of Things technologies has the potential to revolutionize the way chronic illness is managed. These systems can be integrated with wearable/portable devices and other sensors to track vital signs in real-time. This information can then be transmitted to healthcare providers for review, allowing for early detection of any changes or potential issues. The benefits of such systems are numerous. They provide patients with increased freedom and mobility, as they no longer need to visit a healthcare facility for regular check-ups. They also reduce the workload for healthcare providers, freeing up time for more critical cases. Furthermore, they can result in cost savings for healthcare systems by reducing the need for hospitalization. This work introduces the SMART CARE project that aims to develop an integrated monitoring system consisting of hardware and software components that can make the various phases of managing a patient with chronic heart failure (prevention, diagnosis, therapy, follow-up) more efficient.

Thanks to these platforms, it is possible to assist patients remotely, being continuously monitored according to personalized care plans as if they were at the hospital. The characteristics of telemedicine platforms resulted extremely useful when Covid-19 pandemic broke out. Intense monitoring of patients at home, social distancing, and resource rationalization provided great help to medical personnel and healthcare systems. This novel disease, however, has posed new challenges, given by the quicker evolution of a patient's clinical status with respect to chronic diseases. In particular, the updates of the care plan performed remotely by doctors need to be immediately delivered to monitoring kits located at the patient’s home, in order to adjust the monitoring plan of the target patient. Since this update is a critical operation, acknowledgment strategies are required to guarantee feedbacks upon delivery. Immediate updates can be achieved via a push notification system. In this paper, we present a push notification system based on HiveMQ Community Edition message broker, that provides end-to-end positive (ACK) and negative (NACK) acknowledgments, strict authentication, and authorization of users and messages, security, data consistency, and privacy. The realized system has been integrated and tested in the E@syCare telemedicine platform certified as a medical device, but it can be easily adopted by any other telemedicine solutions, as long as they can perform web service requests to the authentication server and integrate HiveMQ client library in their software components."

Although, these technologies have increased the treatment’s precision but the growing number and the complexity of IoT healthcare devices are impacting accuracy along with several other challenges. Moreover, the use of different programming languages, operating platforms and data management methodologies are creating restrictions in safe exchange, integration and reuse of information across different applications. However, with the advent of the semantic web, the semantic technologies are growing in healthcare systems due to the capability of machine interpretation and processing by overcoming the restriction of languages and data heterogeneity. The most common shortcoming in the existing systems are the context-awareness and quality of services and the absence of rich patient ontology; leading towards low accuracy of results. To this aim, this paper provides a smart health framework, consisting on the collection and processing of IoT data (related to patient conditions and context). The framework is supported by the patient ontology along with SWRL rules for better decision making that consider different features (context-awareness and quality of services) differently that results in the improved accuracy.

BIoTHR refers to the proposed scheme on the private blockchain-assisted EHR management using IoT. Specifically, new blockchain and swarm exchange infrastructures are suggested as a backbone of the proposed scheme to ensure secure and reliable data transmission and timely monitoring of data sent across IoT networks. An autonomous encryption-decryption mechanism is also utilized, along with a dynamic and modular server assistance technology to deploy EHR transmission in a secure manner. Moreover, several swarm-listen, announcement, peer open and peer closing algorithms are incorporated to employ the actual power of pervasive EHR transmission for better e-healthcare service provisioning.

Especially in the field of medicine, where each patient is often asked to undergo many different examinations within one diagnosis or treatment. Each examination can help in the diagnosis or prediction of further disease progression. Furthermore, all produced data from these examinations must be stored somewhere and available to various medical practitioners for analysis who may be in geographically diverse locations. The current medical climate leans towards remote patient monitoring and AI-assisted diagnosis. To make this possible, medical data should ideally be secured and made accessible to many medical practitioners, which makes them prone to malicious entities. Medical information has inherent value to malicious entities due to its privacy-sensitive nature in a variety of ways. Furthermore, if access to data is distributively made available to AI algorithms (particularly neural networks) for further analysis/diagnosis, the danger to the data may increase (e.g., model poisoning with fake data introduction). In this paper, we propose a federated learning approach that uses decentralized learning with blockchain-based security and a proposition that accompanies that training intelligent systems using distributed and locally-stored data for the use of all patients.

Subsequently, we design an efficient parameter aggregation algorithm for distributed medical institutions to generate a new global model, and the total amount of data transmitted by N nodes is only $2/N$ times that of traditional algorithm. In addition, data security among different medical institutions is enhanced by adding artificial noise to the edge model.

It was used Enhanced Mayfly Clustering-based Q Learner Routing (EMCQLR) and Exponential Key-based Elliptical Curve Cryptography (EKECC) techniques. In EMCQLR, Enhanced Mayfly optimization Algorithm (EMOA) was used to select the Cluster Head (CH) for data collection from the nodes and form clusters of IoT medical sensors. This paper proposes a new approach called EMOA with Active Elite Approach (EMOA-AEA) to deal with the issues of slow convergence speed and the tendency of EMOA to fall into local optimum. The EMOA-AEA algorithm establishes a definite area around the most optimal mayfly in the present population, which is used to identify the top-performing CH. This region’s search radius is then adjusted as needed. Elite mayflies are subsequently produced within this designated zone, and if their fitness level surpasses that of the most exceptional mayfly, the finest cluster head from these new elite mayflies is selected to replace the current population’s top mayfly. After the selection of cluster head, Path-Weighted Q Reinforcement Learning (PWQRL) is used for data routing. At last, EKECC algorithm encrypts the medical records to provide data security. The experimental outcomes prove that the EMOA-AEA method surpasses the existing method in terms of network lifetime, average energy consumption, and throughput."

However, eminent challenges in automating the resources man-agement of Big Data pipelines across the Computing Continuum remain. The resource management and adaptation for Big Data pipelines across the Computing Continuum require significant research effort, as the current data processing pipelines are dynamic. In contrast, traditional resource management strategies are static, leading to inefficient pipeline scheduling and overly complex process deployment. To address these needs, we propose in this work a scheduling and adaptation approach implemented as a software tool to lower the technological barriers to the management of Big Data pipelines over the Computing Continuum. The approach separates the static scheduling from the run-time execution, em-powering domain experts with little infrastructure and software knowledge to take an active part in the Big Data pipeline adaptation.

To address this, we present a novel security architecture for IoMT that relies on ciphertext policy attributebased encryption (CP-ABE). The architecture applies a dynamic access structure for the encryption in accordance with the status of the medical data collected by IoMT devices. We define some new components mainly hosted on the IoMT gateways in order to encrypt and decrypt the medical data in the architecture. An IoMT use case is presented to show how our proposed architecture supports dynamic encryption in ehealthcare systems."

Pitner,A Real time Healthcare Tracking System based on Blockchain Application,,"Smart health systems have the potential to improve the life and the provided health quality. Since the collaborative working is important in healthcare, the integration of Blockchain for the distribution of real-time patient health becomes more and more important because non-authorized access can result in health risks or private information disclosure. Many Blockchain healthcare applications have been proposed to manage the patient information, however, there is still a lack of providing a smart real-time healthcare monitoring and tracking system. This paper therefore proposes a Real-Time Healthcare system (RTH-Care) based on Blockchain technology that supports the life cycle of a patient in the healthcare system. In particular, we improve the quality of the healthcare system by ensuring a consensus around tests and information about the patients and by centralizing the prescription system. Furthermore, we collect patient health data by integrating medical IoT devices. Subsequently, we provide a data access control to restrict access to the granted persons. The performance analysis of the implementation of RTH-Care with the Hyperledger Fabric tool is showing promising results. An analysis of the communication failures is discussed by using Hyperledger Caliper. Indeed, the obtained results show that our solution is reliable and scalable in terms of the number of transactions per second processed by the network, and the average latency measurements."

Security is expected as a crucial requirement also of future sixth-generation (6G) networks, which represent a valuable means to favor the definitive development of eHealth, hitherto hindered by the insufficient adequacy of technologies. In particular, device-to-device (D2D) has already emerged in previous generations of cellular networks as a promising solution to enable fast and reliable data exchange between devices, and it is expected to be an enabling technology of forthcoming 6G networks as well. However, the security of D2D communication in eHealth is a major concern due to the possibility of unauthorized access and data breaches. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an authentication protocol to secure D2D communications established to support the development of eHealth multimedia applications in 6G-oriented networks.

Zeadally,GaRuDa: A Blockchain-Based Delivery Scheme Using Drones for Healthcare 5.0 Applications,,"Over the years, the healthcare industry has transformed from being hospital-centric to patient-centric. This shift is mainly due to the convergence of emergent technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT)-based healthcare, fifth generation (5G)-assisted networking, and data-driven analytics through artificial intelligence. The convergence, referred to as Healthcare 5.0, has improved healthcare services to support real-time analytics, user mobility, remote monitoring, and personalized user experience through decentralized applications. However, the medical supply chain systems and delivery operations among healthcare stakeholders suffer from limitations of harsh environmental conditions due to restricted zones, rough terrains, war-prone areas, poor road conditions, congested traffic, and remote locations. Thus, the Internet of Drones (IoD) is deployed in Healthcare 5.0 supply chains to streamline and expedite the medical delivery process through open channels (i.e. the Internet). However, the Internet is an open channel that is prone to malicious activities which can violate the privacy and confidentiality of patient data. Blockchain is a promising technology that can handle the security and reliability of drone delivery among untrusted open channels. Motivated by the aforementioned facts, we propose GaRuDa, a blockchain-based drone delivery scheme for Healthcare 5.0 applications. The proposed scheme integrates IoD and blockchain through 5G-enabled tactile Internet to facilitate low-latency responsive delivery of medical supplies that can be chronologically monitored and tracked among different stakeholders. We compared the proposed scheme with the traditional medical delivery scheme with payment gateways to demonstrate its effectiveness in terms of data storage, computation, and communication costs. The simulation results obtained show that the average transaction cost has been reduced by ≈ 44.56 percent, and 5G tactile Internet has a reduced latency of 0.051 ms compared to 18.3 ms in 4G LTE service. The average communication overheads have reduced by ≈ 67.34 percent compared to traditional 4G LTE and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing channels, which indicates the scheme's viability."

Bhat,Healthcare 5.0: A Study on Improving Personalized Care,,"Medicine has been chiefly a reactionary profession throughout history. Even today, one has to wait until diseases have manifested before attempting to treat or cure them. And because the genetic and environmental components that contribute to major diseases like Cancer, Alzheimer’s and cardiovascular diseases are not fully understandable, our efforts to treat them are often haphazard, unpredictable, and inefficient. As a result, the drugs and therapies developed are evaluated on large groups of people and given based on statical averages. And because of the genetic variances, they function for some patients but not for others. Every prescription medicine now on the market only works for half of the people who take it. Based on each patient’s unique genetic composition and environment circumstances, personalized medicine is a critical milestone to be attained to address this issue. Artificial intelligence and blockchain have recently been innovations in the healthcare industry. Furthermore, blockchain can control patient data privacy among participants. It uses asymmetric cryptography to secure transactions between users without the need for any intermediary or a trusted third party, thanks to smart contracts. On the other hand, Artificial intelligence provides intellect and decision-making capabilities for robots similar to humans. This study also identifies and analyses open research problems associated with blockchain and artificial intelligence in personalized medicine."

J,VitalLink: NodeMCU IoT Solution for Vital Signs Surveillance,,"This research study proposes the development of comprehensive vital sign surveillance designed for real-time patient assessment. The system integrates multiple sensors, including the LM35 temperature sensor, Heartbeat Rate (HBR) and Blood Oxygen (SpO2) Sensor, DHT11 humidity and temperature sensor, OLED display, and gyroscope sensor, to provide a holistic approach to vital signs. The LM35 sensor is employed for accurate temperature measurement, providing crucial data for monitoring the patient's thermal status. This information is essential for detecting fever or abnormal temperature variations, aiding in the early identification of potential health issues. The HBR and SpO2 sensor plays a vital role in cardiovascular vital signs. The system can assess the patient's cardiac and respiratory well-being by measuring the heart rate and blood oxygen levels. Abnormalities in these parameters can trigger timely alerts, enabling swift medical intervention. The DHT11 sensor enhances the system's capabilities by monitoring ambient temperature and humidity. This additional environmental data contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the patient's surroundings, ensuring that external factors are considered in the health assessment process. Integrating an OLED display serves as an intuitive user interface, providing real-time feedback on the measured parameters. This ensures that patients and healthcare providers can easily interpret and respond to the health data presented by the system. The display can showcase temperature, humidity, heart rate, blood oxygen levels, and other relevant information in a user-friendly format. Furthermore, the gyroscope sensor adds a layer of sophistication to vital sign surveillance by enabling the assessment of body movement and posture. This feature is particularly beneficial for patients with mobility issues or those prone to falls. The gyroscope data can be analyzed to detect sudden movements or abnormal postures, triggering alerts to caregivers or healthcare professionals. The system is designed for user convenience, ensuring ease of use and portability. Wireless connectivity options can be incorporated, allowing data to be transmitted to a centralized monitoring platform or a mobile application. This enables remote monitoring, facilitating timely interventions and improving patient outcomes.

Since these precious data are susceptible to various security attacks, continuous monitoring of the system's compliance and identification of security risks in IoT data propagation is essential through potentially several layers of applications. This paper pinpoints how security-aware data provenance graphs can support compliance checking and risk estimation by including sufficient information on security controls and other security-relevant evidence. Real-time analysis of these security evidence to enable a step-wise validation and providing the evidence of this validation to end-users is currently not possible with the available data. This paper analyzes the security concerns in different phases of data propagation in a designed IoT-health scenario and promotes step-wise validation of security evidence. It proposes a system model with a novel protocol that documents and verifies evidence for security controls for data-object relations in data provenance graphs to assist compliance checking of security regulation of healthcare systems. With this regard, this paper discusses the proposed system model design with the requirements for technical safeguards of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Based on the verification output at each phase, the proposed protocol reports this chain of verification by creating certain security tokens.

It provides better medical identification to claim the features namely trustworthy, efficient, and resourceful. Moreover, the telecare services automate the remote healthcare monitoring process to ease professional workloads. Importantly, it is conceived to be more timesaving, economical, and easy healthcare access. Cloud-Based Medical Healthcare (CBMH) system is a standard platform that gives its support to the patients for emergency treatment from the medical experts over Internet communication. Since the medical records are very sensitive, security protection is much necessitated. In addition, patient anonymity should be well preserved. In 2016, Chiou et al. proposed a mutual authentication protocol for the Telecare Medical Information System (TMIS) using Cloud Environment (CE). They claim that their protocol satisfies patient anonymity. However, this paper proves that the Chiou et al. scheme is not only completely insecure against the patient anonymity, health-report revelation, health-report forgery, report confidentiality, and non-repudiation but also fails to validate the service access against verifiability, undeniability and unforgeability. In order to provide better mutual authenticity, this paper suggests the framework of smart service authentication to cross-examine the common secret session key among the communication entities. In order to examine the security properties, formal and informal verification was carried out. Lastly, to prove the security and performance efficiency of a system, the proposed SSA framework was implemented using FPGA and Moteiv TMote Sky-Mote. A proposed smart service authentication (SSA) framework is presented to ensure better data security between the patients and the physicians. The formal and informal security analysis proves the significance of the SSA framework model to withstand the security attacks such as health-report forgery, health-report revelation, server-spoofing etc. As a result, it is claimed that it can be well suited for TMIS."

In IoT-enabled Wireless Medical Sensor Network (WMSN), the smart sensing devices share remote patient monitoring data towards central repositories. During medical data aggregation and transmission, security is mandatory to guard against intruders. The main problem in existing base schemes is that complex multiplication operations are used for batch key creation. These schemes are computationally expensive and require huge memory space at the aggregator node (AN). This paper presents a lightweight Secure Aggregation and Transmission Scheme (SATS) for secure and lightweight data computation and transmission. SATS provides a lightweight XOR operation for obtaining batch keys instead of the expensive multiplication operation. Furthermore, the AN Receiving Message Algorithm (ARMA) is presented at the AN to aggregate data generated by sensor nodes. The Receiving Message Extractor (RME) algorithm is presented to decrypt the message and perform batch verification at the Fog-Server. SATS protects against several security threats such as denial of service attacks, the man in the middle attack, and reply attacks. The proposed SATS is simulated by using simulation tool NS 2.35. The results show that SATS provides lightweight data transmission by reducing computation and communication costs.The computation cost of the SATS scheme is 14%, 23% and 59% at AN, and at Fog-Node 6.5%, 21.5% and 51%, and Communication cost 6%, 3%, and 4% at Sensor Node, and at AN 6%, 9%, and 12% better than PPDAS, IDAP, and ASAS respectively.

The increasing prevalence of HF and inpatient HF hospitalization has a considerable burden on healthcare cost and utilization. The recognition that hemodynamic changes in pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and left atrial pressure precede the signs and symptoms of HF has led to interest in hemodynamic guided HF therapy as an approach to allow earlier intervention during a heart failure decompensation. Remote patient monitoring (RPM) utilizing telecommunication, cardiac implantable electronic device parameters and implantable hemodynamic monitors (IHM) have largely failed to demonstrate favorable outcomes in multicenter trials. However, one positive randomized clinical trial testing the CardioMEMS device (followed by Food and Drug Administration approval) has generated renewed interest in PAP monitoring in the HF population to decrease hospitalization and improve quality of life. The COVID-19 pandemic has also stirred a resurgence in the utilization of telehealth to which RPM using IHM may be complementary. The cost effectiveness of these monitors continues to be a matter of debate. Future iterations of devices aim to be smaller, less burdensome for the patient, less dependent on patient compliance, and less cumbersome for health care providers with the integration of artificial intelligence coupled with sophisticated data management and interpretation tools. Currently, use of IHM may be considered in advanced heart failure patients with the support of structured programs."

This shift is evident as healthcare providers and patients alike are becoming increasingly accepting of wearable-driven tools, as they enable continuous health monitoring outside of traditional clinical settings. Equally, the ubiquitous nature of smartphones, now more than mere communication tools, is being harnessed to serve as pivotal health monitoring instruments. Their added sensing capabilities with Internet of Things (IoT) driven connectivity enable a (relatively) seamless transition from conventional health practices to a more interconnected, digital age. However, this evolving landscape is not without its challenges, with concerns surrounding data privacy, security, and ensuring equitable access to digital advances.

The purpose of this review is to describe the current use of telehealth, mobile applications and wearable devices in inflammatory bowel disease and potential future applications. RECENT FINDINGS: Telemedicine was increasingly used during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic. Virtual consultations allowed clinical care to continue despite pandemic-related restrictions without compromising the quality of care for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It also benefits patients who would not have access to care due to financial or geographical barriers. Mobile applications allow patients with IBD to record disease activity among other metrics, allowing for earlier healthcare provider intervention. Wearable devices are increasingly being explored to monitor physiological indicators of disease activity and flare. SUMMARY: Telehealth and remote patient monitoring has been successfully integrated into the care of IBD patients. The advantages of these modalities include better access to specialist care and remote noninvasive disease monitoring. Careful consideration must be given to patient privacy, data protection and equitable access. These modalities have enormous potential to improve patient care through accurate consistent data collection and even the prediction of disease activity."

It is not a matter of ""if"" but ""when"" we will face the next pandemic, and how we leverage technology and data management effectively to create flexible ecosystems that facilitate collaboration, equitable care, and innovation will determine its severity and scale. The aim of this review is to address emerging challenges that came to light during the pandemic in health care and innovations that enabled us to adapt and continue to care for patients. The pandemic highlighted the need for seismic shifts in care paradigms and technology with considerations related to the digital divide and health literacy for digital health interventions to reach full potential and improve health outcomes. We discuss advances in telemedicine, remote patient monitoring, and emerging wearable technologies. Despite the promise of digital health, we emphasise the importance of addressing its limitations, including interpretation challenges, accuracy of findings, and artificial intelligence-driven algorithms. We summarise the most recent recommendation of the Virtual Care Task Force to scaling virtual medical services in Canada. Finally, we propose a model for optimal implementation of health digital innovations with 5 tenets including data management, data security, digital biomarkers, useful artificial intelligence, and clinical integration."

Our analysis of health privacy laws indicates that most US patients may have little access to their own digital health data in the United States under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Privacy Rule, whereas the EU General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act grant greater access to device-collected data. Our normative analysis argues for consistently granting patients access to the raw data collected by their implantable devices. CONTEXT: Millions of life-sustaining implantable devices collect and relay massive amounts of digital health data, increasingly by using user-downloaded smartphone applications to facilitate data relay to clinicians via manufacturer servers. Whether patients have either legal or normative claims to data collected by these devices, particularly in the raw, granular format beyond that summarized in their medical records, remains incompletely explored. METHODS: Using pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) as a clinical model, we outline the clinical ecosystem of data collection, relay, retrieval, and documentation. We consider the legal implications of US and European privacy regulations for patient access to either summary or raw device data. Lastly, we evaluate ethical arguments for or against providing patients access to data beyond the summaries presented in medical records. FINDINGS: Our analysis of applicable health privacy laws indicates that US patients may have little access to their raw data collected and held by device manufacturers in the United States under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Privacy Rule, whereas the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) grants greater access to device-collected data when the processing of personal data falls under the GDPR's territorial scope. The California Consumer Privacy Act, the ""little sister"" of the GDPR, also grants greater rights to California residents. By contrast, our normative analysis argues for consistently granting patients access to the raw data collected by their implantable devices. Smartphone applications are increasingly involved in the collection, relay, retrieval, and documentation of these data. Therefore, we argue that smartphone user agreements are an emerging but potentially underutilized opportunity for clarifying both legal and ethical claims for device-derived data. CONCLUSIONS: Current health privacy legislation incompletely supports patients' normative claims for access to digital health data."

The need for further investigation, monitoring and therapeutic management are advancing practical issues which had not been identified for consideration prior to the pandemic. Using the marketing assessment, we identified the needs of the patients and evaluated the future steps necessary in the short term to meet them. The research found progress made via telemedicine in monitoring and conducting minor decisions (like up-titrating the doses of different medication regimens) in patients with several cardiovascular diseases (heart failure, atrial fibrillation, high blood pressure), as there is a worldwide trend to develop new telemonitoring biosensors and devices based on implantable delivered transcatheter. The worldwide telemedicine trend encourages a switch from small and hesitating steps to a more consistent assessment of the patients, based on high technology and Interventional Cardiology. Cardiovascular telemedicine, although made a sustainable effort in managing patients' health, has many obstacles to overcome before meeting all their needs. Data security, confidentiality and reimbursement are the top priorities in developing remote Cardiology. The regulatory institutions need to play an integrative role in leading the way for defining the framework of future telemedicine activities. The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak with all its tragedy served to reinforce the message that telemedicine services can be life-saving for cardiovascular patients. Once the Covid-19 era will fade away, telemedicine is likely to remain a complementary service of standard care. There is still room to improve the remote identification and investigation of heart disease, provide an accurate diagnosis and therapeutic regimen, and update regulations and guidelines to the new realities of technological progress in the field."

METHODS: We performed an international multi-centre survey study in three MND clinics in The Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Australia. The survey was co-developed by investigators and patients with MND, and sent to patients by e-mail or postal-mail. The main topics included: patients' attitude towards remote care, participating in decentralized clinical trials, and preferences for and concerns with digital technology use. RESULTS: In total, 332 patients with MND participated. A majority of patients indicated they would be happy to self-monitor their health from home (69%), be remotely monitored by a multidisciplinary care team (75%), and would be willing to participate in clinical trials from home (65%). Patients considered respiratory function and muscle strength most valuable for home-monitoring. The majority of patients considered the use of at least three devices/apps (75%) once a week (61%) to be acceptable for home-monitoring. Fifteen percent of patients indicated they would not wish to perform home-measurements; reporting concerns about the burden and distress of home-monitoring, privacy and data security. CONCLUSION: Most patients with MND exhibited a positive attitude toward the use of digital technology in both care and clinical trial settings. A subgroup of patients reported concerns with home-monitoring, which should be addressed in order to improve widespread adoption of remote digital technology in clinical MND care."

Several factors contribute to this vulnerability including traditional risk factors such as age, gender, life style and comorbidities, and non-traditional ones as part of dialysis-induced systemic stress. In this context, it appears of utmost importance to bring a closer attention to CVD monitoring in caring for CKD5D patients to ensure early and appropriate intervention for improving their outcomes. Interestingly, new home-used, self-operated, connected medical devices offer convenient and new tools for monitoring in a fully automated and ambulatory mode CKD5D patients during the interdialytic period. Sensoring devices are installed with WiFi or Bluetooth. Some devices are also available in a cellular version such as the Withings Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) solution. These devices analyze the data and upload the results to Withings HDS (Hybrid data security) platform servers. Data visualization can be viewed by the patient using the Withings Health Mate application on a smartphone, or with a web interface. Health Care Professionals (HCP) can also visualize patient data via the Withings web-based RPM interface. In this narrative essay, we analyze the clinical potential of pervasive wearable sensors for monitoring ambulatory dialysis patients and provide an assessment of such toolkit digital medical health devices currently available on the market. These devices offer a fully automated, unobtrusive and remote monitoring of main vital functions in ambulatory subjects. These unique features provide a multidimensional assessment of ambulatory CKD5D patients covering most physiologic functionalities, detecting unexpected disorders (i.e., volume overload, arrhythmias, sleep disorders) and allowing physicians to judge patient's response to treatment and recommendations. In the future, the wider availability of such pervasive health sensing and digital technology to monitor patients at an affordable cost price will improve the personalized management of CKD5D patients, so potentially resulting in improvements in patient quality of life and survival."

Data-driven tools and novel technologies have the capability to address these shortcomings, but insights from all stakeholders in the care continuum remain lacking. A structured online questionnaire was given to respondents (n = 1432) in nine global geographies to investigate attitudes to the use of data and novel technologies in the management of vascular disease. Patients with coronary or peripheral artery disease (n = 961), physicians responsible for their care (n = 345), and administrators/healthcare leaders with responsibility for commissioning/procuring cardiovascular services (n = 126) were included. Narrative themes arising from the survey included patients' desire for more personalized healthcare, shared decision-making, and improved communication. Patients, administrators, and physicians perceived and experienced deficiencies in continuity of care, and all acknowledged the potential for data-driven techniques and novel technologies to address some of these shortcomings. Further, physicians and administrators saw the 'upstream' segment of the care journey-before diagnosis, at point of diagnosis, and when determining treatment-as key to enabling tangible improvements in patient experience and outcomes. Finally, despite acceptance that data sharing is critical to the success of such interventions, there remains persistent issues related to trust and transparency. The current fragmented care continuum could be improved and streamlined through the adoption of advanced data analytics and novel technologies, including diagnostic and monitoring techniques. Such an approach could enable the refocusing of healthcare from intermittent contacts and intervention-only focus to a more holistic patient view."

With a growing body of supportive clinical studies, advances in digital inhaler sensors and platforms, greater support from payers and healthcare organizations, significant growth with these technologies is expected. While all digital (smart) inhalers record adherence, these are distinguished by their compatibility with commercial inhalers, capabilities to guide inhaler technique, use of patient-reported outcomes, and user-friendliness for both the healthcare professional (HCP) and patient. Due to the complexity and novelty of employing digital inhalers, collaboration with multiple entities within health systems is necessary and a well-planned integration is needed. For HCPs and patients, cybersecurity and privacy are critical, it will require review by each healthcare organization. In the US, some payers reimburse for remote monitoring using digital inhalers, but reimbursement is currently unavailable in other countries. There are several models for remote patient care, as employing an active, ongoing digital interface between the HCP and patient or they may choose to only review data at clinical encounters. Personalization of therapies and feedback are key to success. While digital inhaler malfunction uncommonly occurs, patient attrition over a year is significant. Some patients will be challenged to use digital platforms or have the necessary technology. Additional research is needed to address cost-effectiveness, in vivo accuracy of inspiratory measurement capable devices, ability to teach inhaler technique, their application for monitoring lung function, and lastly real-world adoption and implementation in routine clinical practice."

This study conducted an overview on the opportunities, the perspectives, and the problems related to the integration of TD with AI. The methodology of this review, following a standardized checklist, was based on: (I) a search of PubMed and Scopus and (II) an eligibility assessment, using parameters with five levels of score. The outcome highlighted that applications of this integration have been identified in various skin pathologies and in quality control, both in eHealth and mHealth. Many of these applications are based on Apps used by citizens in mHealth for self-care with new opportunities but also open questions. A generalized enthusiasm has been registered regarding the opportunities and general perspectives on improving the quality of care, optimizing the healthcare processes, minimizing costs, reducing the stress in the healthcare facilities, and in making citizens, now at the center, more satisfied. However, critical issues have emerged related to: (a) the need to improve the process of diffusion of the Apps in the hands of citizens, with better design, validation, standardization, and cybersecurity; (b) the need for better attention paid to medico-legal and ethical issues; and (c) the need for the stabilization of international and national regulations.

Recent technical breakthroughs potentially offer continuous, reliable, sensitive, and objective remote monitoring solutions for healthcare. Wearables can be useful for evaluating falls, fatigue, sedentary behavior, exercise, and sleep quality in people with MS (PwMS). OBJECTIVE: This scoping review of relevant literature explores studies investigating the perceptions of patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs) about the use of wearable technologies in the management of MS. METHODS: The Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for scoping reviews was used. The search strategy was applied to the databases, MEDLINE via Ovid, Embase, APA PsycInfo, and CINAHL. Further searches were performed in IEEE, Scopus, and Web of Science. The review considered studies reporting quantitative or qualitative data on perceptions and experiences of PwMS and HCPs concerning wearables' usability, satisfaction, barriers, and facilitators. RESULTS: 10 studies were included in this review. Wearables' usefulness and accessibility, ease of use, awareness, and motivational tool potential were patient-perceived facilitators of use. Barriers related to anxiety and frustration, complexity, and the design of wearables. Perceived usefulness and system requirements are identified as facilitators of using wearables by HCPs, while data security concerns and fears of increased workload and limited effectiveness in the care plan are identified as barriers to use wearables. CONCLUSIONS: This review contributes to our understanding of the benefits of wearable technologies in MS by exploring perceptions of both PwMS and HCPs. The scoping review provided a broad overview of facilitators and barriers to wearable use in MS. There is a need for further studies underlined with sound theoretical frameworks to provide a robust evidence-base for the optimal use of wearables to empower healthcare users and providers."

Although mHealth could be used to facilitate the tracking of health changes during pregnancy, challenges remain in data collection compliance and technology engagement among pregnant women. Understanding the interests, preferences, and requirements of pregnant women and those of clinicians is needed when designing and introducing mHealth solutions for supporting pregnant women's monitoring of health and risk factors throughout their pregnancy journey. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand clinicians' and pregnant women's perceptions on the potential use of mHealth, including factors that may influence their engagement with mHealth technologies and the implications for technology design and implementation. METHODS: A qualitative study using semistructured interviews was conducted with 4 pregnant women, 4 postnatal women, and 13 clinicians working in perinatal care. RESULTS: Clinicians perceived the potential benefit of mHealth in supporting different levels of health and well-being monitoring, risk assessment, and care provision in pregnancy care. Most pregnant and postnatal female participants were open to the use of wearables and health monitoring devices and were more likely to use these technologies if they knew that clinicians were monitoring their data. Although it was acknowledged that some pregnancy-related medical conditions are suitable for an mHealth model of remote monitoring, the clinical and technical challenges in the introduction of mHealth for pregnancy care were also identified. Incorporating appropriate health and well-being measures, intelligently detecting any abnormalities, and providing tailored information for pregnant women were the critical aspects, whereas usability and data privacy were among the main concerns of the participants. Moreover, this study highlighted the challenges of engaging pregnant women in longitudinal mHealth monitoring, the additional work required for clinicians to monitor the data, and the need for an evidence-based technical solution. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical, technical, and practical factors associated with the use of mHealth to monitor health and well-being in pregnant women need to be considered during the design and feasibility evaluation stages. Technical solutions and appropriate strategies for motivating pregnant women are critical to supporting their long-term data collection compliance and engagement with mHealth technology during pregnancy."

This topic is very important, as telemedicine and mHealth, when applied to dermatology, could improve both the quality of healthcare for citizens and the workflow in the health domain. The proposed study was centered on the last three years. We conducted an overview on the opportunities, the perspectives, and the problems involved in TD integration with mHealth. The methodology of the narrative review was based on: (I) a search of PubMed and Scopus and (II) an eligibility assessment, using properly proposed parameters. The outcome of the study showed that during the COVID-19 pandemic, TD integration with mHealth advanced rapidly. This integration enabled the monitoring of dermatological problems and facilitated remote specialist visits, reducing face-to-face interactions. AI and mobile apps have empowered citizens to take an active role in their healthcare. This differs from other imaging sectors where information exchange is limited to professionals. The opportunities for TD in mHealth include improving service quality, streamlining healthcare processes, reducing costs, and providing more accessible care. It can be applied to various conditions, such as (but not limited to) acne, vitiligo, psoriasis, and skin cancers. Integration with AI and augmented reality (AR), as well as the use of wearable sensors, are anticipated as future developments. However, integrating TD with mHealth also brings about problems and challenges related to regulations, ethics, cybersecurity, data privacy, and device management.

While several studies have addressed the issue of governance of big data in clinical research from the legal or ethical perspectives, the viewpoint of local research ethics committee (REC) members is underrepresented in the current literature. The aim of this study is therefore to find which specific ethical challenges are raised by RECs in the context of a large European study on remote monitoring in all syndromic stages of Alzheimer's disease, and what gaps remain. METHODS: Documents describing the REC review process at 10 sites in 9 European countries from the project Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse-Alzheimer's Disease (RADAR-AD) were collected and translated. Main themes emerging in the documents were identified using a qualitative analysis approach. RESULTS: Four main themes emerged after analysis: data management, participant's wellbeing, methodological issues, and the issue of defining the regulatory category of RMTs. Review processes differed across sites: process duration varied from 71 to 423 days, some RECs did not raise any issues, whereas others raised up to 35 concerns, and the approval of a data protection officer was needed in half of the sites. DISCUSSION: The differences in the ethics review process of the same study protocol across different local settings suggest that a multi-site study would benefit from a harmonization in research ethics governance processes. More specifically, some best practices could be included in ethical reviews across institutional and national contexts, such as the opinion of an institutional data protection officer, patient advisory board reviews of the protocol and plans for how ethical reflection is embedded within the study."

An effective system for monitoring patients can improve healthcare delivery by avoiding in-person contacts, enabling early-detection of severe cases, and remotely assessing patients' status. Internet of Things (IoT) technologies have been used for monitoring patients' health with wireless wearable sensors in different scenarios and medical conditions, such as noncommunicable and infectious diseases. Combining IoT-related technologies with early-warning scores (EWS) commonly utilized in infirmaries has the potential to enhance health services delivery significantly. Specifically, the NEWS-2 has been showing remarkable results in detecting the health deterioration of COVID-19 patients. Although the literature presents several approaches for remote monitoring, none of these studies proposes a customized, complete, and integrated architecture that uses an effective early-detection mechanism for COVID-19 and that is flexible enough to be used in hospital wards and at home. Therefore, this article's objective is to present a comprehensive IoT-based conceptual architecture that addresses the key requirements of scalability, interoperability, network dynamics, context discovery, reliability, and privacy in the context of remote health monitoring of COVID-19 patients in hospitals and at home. Since remote monitoring of patients at home (essential during a pandemic) can engender trust issues regarding secure and ethical data collection, a consent management module was incorporated into our architecture to provide transparency and ensure data privacy. Further, the article details mechanisms for supporting a configurable and adaptable scoring system embedded in wearable devices to increase usefulness and flexibility for health care professions working with EWS."

OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the publicly available information from the FDA on all recently approved medical devices used in JITIs to (1) assess how they operate to deliver JITIs and (2) appraise the evidence supporting their performance and clinical effectiveness. EVIDENCE REVIEW: Two reviewers systematically searched the Premarket Notifications (510(k)), Premarket Approvals, De Novo, and Humanitarian Device Exemption databases from January 2019 to December 2021 for all entries associated with devices that monitored patients' data over time to personalize the delivery of interventions to treat, prevent, or mitigate health conditions or events. They assessed whether the product summaries (1) enabled an understanding of how the device operated to deliver a JITI (eg, the nature, type, and frequency of the monitoring, the nature of the decision algorithm, and the nature and intended receiver of the intervention); (2) informed about the performance and effectiveness of the JITI; and (3) included information on data security and ownership. FINDINGS: In total, 38 devices were included in this review. These were mainly intended for cardiac conditions (12 [31.6%]), diabetes (10 [26.3%]), and neurological diseases (4 [10.5%]). Monitoring devices ranged from wearable (18 of 28 [64.4%]; eg, smartwatches) to implanted sensors (6 of 28 [21.4%]; eg, inserted electrocardiographic sensors). Only 10 of 38 product summaries (26.3%) allowed a full understanding of how the device operated to deliver a JITI. Similarly, only 12 of 28 (42.9%), 12 of 36 (33.3%), and 5 of 38 (13.2%) reported the assessment of the performance of the monitoring device, assessment of the decision algorithm, and results of clinical studies assessing the effectiveness of the JITI, respectively. Finally, 14 of 36 product summaries (38.9%) included some information on data security, but none included information on data ownership. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: The results of this systematic review suggest that the information publicly available in the FDA databases on the performance and effectiveness of digital medical devices used in JITIs is heterogeneous."

Due to high costs and long waiting times for hospital admission, coupled with technological advances, several centers have developed and implemented video-EEG monitoring in the patient's home (home video-EEG telemetry [HVET]). Here, we review the history and current status of three general approaches to HVET: (1) supervised HVET, which entails setting up video-EEG in the patient's home with daily visiting technologist support; (2) mobile HVET (also termed ambulatory video-EEG), which entails attaching electrodes in a health care facility, supplying the patient and carers with the hardware and instructions, and then asking the patient and carer to set up recording at home without technologist support; and (3) cloud-based HVET, which adds to either of the previous models continuous streaming of video-EEG from the home to the health care provider, with the option to review data in near real time, troubleshoot hardware remotely, and interact remotely with the patient. Our experience shows that HVET can be highly cost-effective and is well received by patients. We note limitations related to long-term electrode attachment and correct camera placing while the patient is unsupervised at home, and concerns related to regulations regarding data privacy for cloud services. We believe that HVET opens significant new opportunities for research, especially in the field of understanding the many influences in seizure occurrence. We speculate that in the future HVET may merge into innovative new multisensor approaches to continuously monitoring people with epilepsy."

To maximise the use of wearable devices in practice, it is important that they are usable by, and offer value to, all stakeholders. Although previous research has explored participants' opinions of devices, to date, limited studies have explored the experiences and opinions of the researchers who use and implement them. Researchers offer a unique insight into wearable devices as they may have access to multiple devices and cohorts, and thus gain a thorough understanding as to how and where this area needs to progress. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the experiences and opinions of researchers from academic, industry and clinical contexts, in the use of wearable devices to measure gait and physical activity. METHODS: Twenty professionals with experience using wearable devices in research were recruited from academic, industry and clinical backgrounds. Independent, semi-structured interviews were conducted, audio-recorded and transcribed. Transcribed texts were analysed using inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Five themes were identified: (1) The positives and negatives of using wearable devices in research, (2) The routine implementation of wearable devices into research and clinical practice, (3) The importance of compromise in protocols, (4) Securing good quality data, and (5) A paradigm shift. Researchers overwhelmingly supported the use of wearable sensor technology due to the insights that they may provide. Though barriers remain, researchers were pragmatic towards these, believing that there is a paradigm shift happening in this area of research that ultimately requires mistakes and significant volumes of further research to allow it to progress. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple barriers to the use of wearable devices in research and clinical practice remain, including data management and clear clinical utility. However, researchers strongly believe that the potential benefit of these devices to support and create new clinical insights for patient care, is greater than any current barrier. Multi-disciplinary research integrating the expertise of both academia, industry and clinicians is a fundamental necessity to further develop wearable devices and protocols that match the varied needs of all stakeholders."

The integration of innovative technologies, such as the Internet of Things, wearable technologies, artificial intelligence, and ambient-assisted living applications, represents a valuable solution for this scope. Designing such an integrated system requires addressing several aspects (eg, equipment selection, data management, analytics, costs, and users' needs) and involving different areas of expertise (eg, medical science, service design, biomedical and computer engineering). OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is 2-fold; we aimed to design the functionalities of a smart health platform addressing 5 chronic conditions prevalent in the older population (ie, hearing loss, cardiovascular diseases, cognitive impairments, mental health problems, and balance disorders) by considering both older adults' and clinicians' perspectives and to evaluate the identified smart health platform functionalities with a small group of older adults. METHODS: Overall, 24 older adults (aged >65 years) and 118 clinicians were interviewed through focus group activities and web-based questionnaires to elicit the smart health platform requirements. Considering the elicited requirements, the main functionalities of smart health platform were designed. Then, a focus group involving 6 older adults was conducted to evaluate the proposed solution in terms of usefulness, credibility, desirability, and learnability. RESULTS: Eight main functionalities were identified and assessed-cognitive training and hearing training (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 6/6, 100%; learnability: 6/6, 100%), monitoring of physiological parameters (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 6/6, 100%; learnability: 5/6, 83%), physical training (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 5/6, 83%; learnability: 2/6, 33%), psychoeducational intervention (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 4/6, 67%; learnability: 2/6, 33%), mood monitoring (usefulness: 4/6, 67%; credibility: 4/6, 67%; desirability: 3/6, 50%; learnability: 5/6, 50%), diet plan (usefulness: 5/6, 83%; credibility: 4/6, 67%; desirability: 1/6, 17%; learnability: 2/6, 33%), and environment monitoring and adjustment (usefulness: 1/6, 17%; credibility: 1/6, 17%; desirability: 0/6, 0%; learnability: 0/6, 0%). Most of them were highly appreciated by older participants, with the only exception being environment monitoring and adjustment. The results showed that the proposed functionalities met the needs and expectations of users (eg, improved self-management of patients' disease and enhanced patient safety). However, some aspects need to be addressed (eg, technical and privacy issues). CONCLUSIONS: The presented smart health platform functionalities seem to be able to meet older adults' needs and desires to enhance their self-awareness and self-management of their medical condition, encourage healthy and independent living, and provide evidence-based support for clinicians' decision-making. Further research with a larger and more heterogeneous pool of stakeholders in terms of demographics and clinical conditions is needed to assess system acceptability and overall user experience in free-living conditions."

Recent advancements in information technology and blockchain technologyhave revolutionized electronic healthcare research and industry. The innovation of miniaturizedhealthcare sensors for monitoring patient vital signs has improved and secured the human healthcaresystem. The increase in portable health devices has enhanced the quality of health-monitoringstatus both at an activity/fitness level for self-health tracking and at a medical level, providing moredata to clinicians with potential for earlier diagnosis and guidance of treatment. When sharingpersonal medical information, data security and comfort are essential requirements for interactionwith and collection of electronic medical records. However, it is hard for current systems to meetthese requirements because they have inconsistent security policies and access control structures.The new solutions should be directed towards improving data access, and should be managed bythe government in terms of privacy and security requirements to ensure the reliability of data formedical purposes. Blockchain paves the way for a revolution in the traditional pharmaceuticalindustry and benefits from unique features such as privacy and transparency of data. In this paper,we propose a novel platform for monitoring patient vital signs using smart contracts based onblockchain. The proposed system is designed and developed using hyperledger fabric, which isan enterprise-distributed ledger framework for developing blockchain-based applications. Thisapproach provides several benefits to the patients, such as an extensive, immutable history log, andglobal access to medical information from anywhere at any time. The Libelium e-Health toolkitis used to acquire physiological data. The performance of the designed and developed system isevaluated in terms of transaction per second, transaction latency, and resource utilization usinga standard benchmark tool known as Hyperledger Caliper. It is found that the proposed systemoutperforms the traditional health care system for monitoring patient data."

These requirements are fulfilled by portable (wearable) patient devices, with low consumption, which transmit data wirelessly, at a short distance, to a mobile communication device (GSM) and through it, to a remote end recipient - doctor, medical center or a hospital server. The data transfer technology requires the monitored person to perform a sequence of actions, such as: selecting the appropriate application on the mobile phone, establishing a connection between the patient module and the phone, recording the data in the phone's memory, starting the data transfer from the phone to the final receiver. Practice shows that often this sequence of activities is difficult for elderly people and especially for visually impaired people, which as a result compromises the remote monitoring process. In this paper are presented an approach and conceptual implementation of a system for remote monitoring of cardiac activity, using the most popular way of remote connectivity - voice (sound) communication. In addition to the ease of use, this type of communication does not require special data protection, due to the lack of RF interfaces for short-distance data transmission. The presented results of laboratory studies, as well as conducted tests under medical supervision of patients in a cardiology clinic, confirm the workability of the proposed approach for remote monitoring of patients by audio conversion of the ECG signal."

The proliferation of smartphones and wearable devices enables convenient access to health monitoring tools, educational resources, and communication with healthcare providers. mHealth interventions encompass mobile apps, wearables, and telehealth services that empower users to monitor vital signs, adhere to medication, and adopt healthier lifestyles. Their effectiveness hinges on user engagement, leveraging behavioral science principles and gamification strategies. While mHealth offers advantages such as personalized support and increased reach, it faces challenges pertaining to data privacy, security concerns, and resistance from healthcare providers. Robust encryption and adherence to regulations like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) are crucial for safeguarding sensitive health data. Integrating mHealth into clinical workflows can enhance healthcare delivery, but organizational adjustments are necessary. The future of mHealth is closely intertwined with artificial intelligence (AI), enabling remote monitoring, predictive algorithms, and data-driven insights. Tech giants are incorporating advanced health-tracking capabilities into their devices, paving the way for personalized wellness approaches. However, mHealth grapples with ethical dilemmas surrounding data ownership, privacy breaches, and inadvertent data capture. Despite its potential, mHealth necessitates a concerted effort to overcome obstacles and ensure ethical, secure, and practical implementation. Addressing technical challenges, fostering standardization, and promoting equitable access are pivotal for unlocking the transformative impact of mHealth on cardiovascular health and reducing the global burden of CVD."

Telehealth prevalence and use increased during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, familiarity with and use of telehealth and health-related mobile applications (apps) by persons with epilepsy remain unknown. Methods: We investigated telehealth use, demographics, and clinical variables within the multicenter Epi2020 cross-sectional study. Between October and December 2020, adults with epilepsy completed a validated questionnaire, including individual questions regarding knowledge and use of apps and telehealth. Results: Of 476 included individuals (58.2% women; mean age 40.2 ± 15.4 years), 41.6% reported using health-related apps. Health apps were used more frequently (pedometer 32.1%, exercise app 17.6%) than medical apps (health insurance 15.1%, menstrual apps 12.2%) or apps designed for epilepsy (medication reminders 10.3%, seizure calendars 4.6%). Few used seizure detectors (i.e., apps as medical devices 1.9%) or mobile health devices (fitness bracelet 11.3%). A majority (60.9%) had heard the term telehealth, 78.6% of whom had a positive view. However, only 28.6% had a concrete idea of telehealth, and only 16.6% reported personal experience with telehealth. A majority (55%) would attend a teleconsultation follow-up, and 41.2% would in a medical emergency. Data privacy and availability were considered equally important by 50.8%, 21.8% considered data privacy more important, and 20.2% considered data availability more important. Current health-related app use was independently associated with younger age (p = 0.003), higher education (p < 0.001), and subjective COVID-19-related challenges (p = 0.002). Persistent seizure occurrence (vs. seizure freedom ≥12 months) did not affect willingness to use teleconsultations on multivariable logistic regression analysis. Conclusions: Despite positive telehealth views, few persons with epilepsy in Germany are familiar with specific apps or services. Socioeconomic factors influence telehealth use more than baseline epilepsy characteristics. Telehealth education and services should target socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals to reduce the digital care gap.

IoMT integrates medical devices for real-time data analysis and transmission but faces challenges in data security and interoperability. This research identifies a significant gap in the existing literature regarding a comprehensive ontology for vulnerabilities in medical IoT devices. This paper proposes a fundamental domain ontology named MIoT (Medical Internet of Things) ontology, focusing on cybersecurity in IoMT (Internet of Medical Things), particularly in remote patient monitoring settings. This research will refer to similar-looking acronyms, IoMT and MIoT ontology. It is important to distinguish between the two. IoMT is a collection of various medical devices and their applications within the research domain. On the other hand, MIoT ontology refers to the proposed ontology that defines various concepts, roles, and individuals. MIoT ontology utilizes the knowledge engineering methodology outlined in Ontology Development 101, along with the structured life cycle, and establishes semantic interoperability among medical devices to secure IoMT assets from vulnerabilities and cyberattacks. By defining key concepts and relationships, it becomes easier to understand and analyze the complex network of information within the IoMT. The MIoT ontology captures essential key terms and security-related entities for future extensions. A conceptual model is derived from the MIoT ontology and validated through a case study. Furthermore, this paper outlines a roadmap for future research, highlighting potential impacts on security automation in healthcare applications."

Similar to the European General Data Protection Regulation, in Brazil, the Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados established rules and guidelines for the processing of personal data, including those used for patient care, such as those captured by smartwatches. Thus, in any telemonitoring scenario, there is a need to comply with rules and regulations, making this issue a challenge to overcome. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to build a digital solution model for capturing data from wearable devices and making them available in a safe and agile manner for clinical and research use, following current laws. METHODS: A functional model was built following the Brazilian Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados (2018), where data captured by smartwatches can be transmitted anonymously over the Internet of Things and be identified later within the hospital. A total of 80 volunteers were selected for a 24-week follow-up clinical trial divided into 2 groups, one group with a previous diagnosis of COVID-19 and a control group without a previous diagnosis of COVID-19, to measure the synchronization rate of the platform with the devices and the accuracy and precision of the smartwatch in out-of-hospital conditions to simulate remote monitoring at home. RESULTS: In a 35-week clinical trial, >11.2 million records were collected with no system downtime; 66% of continuous beats per minute were synchronized within 24 hours (79% within 2 days and 91% within a week). In the limit of agreement analysis, the mean differences in oxygen saturation, diastolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure, and heart rate were -1.280% (SD 5.679%), -1.399 (SD 19.112) mm Hg, -1.536 (SD 24.244) mm Hg, and 0.566 (SD 3.114) beats per minute, respectively. Furthermore, there was no difference in the 2 study groups in terms of data analysis (neither using the smartwatch nor the gold-standard devices), but it is worth mentioning that all volunteers in the COVID-19 group were already cured of the infection and were highly functional in their daily work life. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the results obtained, considering the validation conditions of accuracy and precision and simulating an extrahospital use environment, the functional model built in this study is capable of capturing data from the smartwatch and anonymously providing it to health care services, where they can be treated according to the legislation and be used to support clinical decisions during remote monitoring."

With an aging global population, innovative approaches to HF evaluation and management are needed to cope with the worsening HF epidemic. The aim of the Real-Life Multimarker Monitoring in Patients with Heart Failure (REALIsM-HF) study (NCT03507439) is to evaluate a composite instrument comprising remote, real-time, activity-monitoring devices combined with daily electronic patient-reported outcome (ePRO) items in patients who have been hospitalized for HF and are undergoing standard HF assessment (e.g., 6-min walking distance [6MWD], blood biomarkers, Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire [KCCQ], and echocardiography). METHODS: REALIsM-HF is an ongoing, 12-week, observational study enrolling 80-100 patients aged ≥45 years with HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF; EF ≥45%) or reduced EF (HFrEF; EF ≤35%). Statistical analyses will include examining the association between data from wearables (the AVIVO(©) mobile patient management patch or VitalPatch(©) biosensor, and the DynaPort MoveMonitor(©)), daily ePROs, and conventional HF metrics (e.g., serum/plasma biomarkers, 6MWD, KCCQ, and echocardiographic parameters). The feasibility of and patient compliance with at-home devices will be documented, and the data captured for the purpose of establishing reference values in patients with HFpEF or HFrEF will be summarized. CONCLUSIONS: The REALIsM-HF study is to evaluate the longitudinal daily activity profiles of patients with HF and correlate these with changes in serum/plasma biomarker profiles, symptoms, quality of life, and cardiac function and morphology to inform the use of wearable activity monitors for developing novel therapies and managing patients."

Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has eased the situation to a great extent, also COVID-19 has motivated scientists to make new 'Smart' healthcare system focusing towards early diagnosis, prevention of spread, education and treatment and facilitate living in the new normal. This review aims to identify the role of IoMT applications in improving healthcare system and to analyze the status of research demonstrating effectiveness of IoMT benefits to the patient and healthcare system along with a brief insight into technologies supplementing IoMT and challenges faced in developing a smart healthcare system. An internet-based search in PUBMED, Google Scholar and IEEE Library for english language publications using relevant terms resulted in 987 articles. After screening title, abstract, and content related to IoMT in healthcare and excluding duplicate articles, 135 articles published in journal with impact factor ≥1 were eligible for inclusion.

In this paper, we present a novel methodology for categorizing AIoMT devices through the application of decentralized processing, referred to as ""Federated Learning"" (FL). Our approach involves deploying a system on standard IoT devices and labeled IoMT devices for training purposes and attribute extraction. Through this process, we extract and map the interconnected attributes from a global federated cum aggression server. The aim of this terminology is to extract interdependent devices via federated learning, ensuring data privacy and adherence to operational policies. Consequently, a global training dataset repository is coordinated to establish a centralized indexing and synchronization knowledge repository. The categorization process employs generic labels for devices transmitting medical data through regular communication channels. We evaluate our proposed methodology across a variety of IoT, IoMT, and AIoMT devices, demonstrating effective classification and labeling.

2024 Aug 8,Technology and health care : official journal of the European Society for Engineering and Medicine,10.3233/THC-240790 [doi],Anjikumar T; Chakravarthy ASN,Secure data communication in WSHN using EXP-MD5 and DHSK-ECC.,Netherlands,"BACKGROUND: In the Healthcare (HC) sector, the usage of Wireless Sensor Healthcare Networks (WSHN) is attaining specific importance. The sensor device is implanted into the patient's body, and the sensed health information of patients is transformed via data aggregating devices like mobile devices, cameras, and so on, to the doctors. Thus, the early signs of diseases are identified, and remote monitoring of the patient's health is carried out by the physician on time. This aids in improving the health condition of the people and reduces the severity of disorders. But, the security gap in HC remains unresolved, despite various advantages. OBJECTIVE: This work proposes secured data communication in WSHN using Exponential Message Digest5 (EXP-MD5) and Diffie Hellman Secret Key-based Elliptic Curve Cryptography (DHSK-ECC) techniques. METHODS: Primarily, the patient registers their details in the Hospital Cloud Server (HCS). With hospital ID and patient ID, public and private keys are generated during registration. Afterward, by utilizing the Navie Shuffling (NS) technique, nCr combinations are created and shuffled. After shuffling, any of the randomly selected combinations are encoded utilizing the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) code. For patient authentication, the ASCII code is further converted into a Quick Response(QR) code. Upon successful registration, the patient logs in to HCS. The patient can book for doctor's appointment if the login details are verified with those of the registered details. On consulting the doctor at the pre-informed time, the digital signature is created utilizing the Universal Unique Salt-based Digital Signature Algorithm (UUS-DSA) for authenticating the patient details. Further, for providing accessibility to all the authorized patients, the registered patients on HCS are considered as nodes. Then, an authorized path is created using the EXP-MD5 technique to protect each individual patient's details. The patient's IoT data is sensed, followed by authorized path creation. The data is encrypted via the DHSK-ECC algorithm for secure data transmission. Lastly, all the information is stored in HCS, so that the patient's health condition is regularly monitored by the doctor and the needy advice is suggested to the patients in the future. Also, hash matching is carried out when the doctor needs to access data. RESULTS: The proposed technique's efficacy is validated by the performance analysis in comparison with other conventional techniques. CONCLUSION: In this proposed research, the authentication is performed in multiple scenarios to enhance data security and user privacy. The patient details are authenticated during registration and verification to access the online consultation only by the authorized person. Further, the patient health information is encrypted in the proposed work after consultation so that the intrusion of medical records by malicious users and data tampering is prevented. Also, the sensed data gathered from patients are transferred to the HCS by creating the authorized path, which further enhances the security of patient data. Thus, the data communication of the WSHN is well-secured in this work through multi-level authentication and improved cryptography techniques."

Despite unwavering levels of cooperation among academia, industry, and policy makers, it can still take years to bring a life-saving product to market. There are some obvious limitations, including lack of blinding or masking and small sample size, which render the results less applicable to the real world. Traditional randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are lengthy, expensive, and have a low success rate. There is a growing acknowledgement that the current process no longer fully meets the growing healthcare needs. Advances in technology coupled with proliferation of telehealth modalities, sensors, wearable and connected devices have paved the way for a new paradigm. Virtual randomized controlled trials (vRCTs) have the potential to drastically shorten the clinical trial cycle while maximizing patient-centricity, compliance, and recruitment. This new approach can inform clinical trials in real time and with a holistic view of a patient's health. This paper provides an overview of virtual clinical trials, addressing critical issues, including regulatory compliance, data security, privacy, and ownership."

The feasibility characteristics for wrist-worn biosensors are poorly described for post-COVID conditions and rural populations. METHODS: We prospectively recruited patients in rural communities who were enrolled in an at-home rehabilitation program for post-COVID conditions. They were asked to wear a FitBit Charge 2 device and biosensor parameters were analyzed [e.g. heart rate, sleep, and activity]. Electronic patient reported outcome measures [E-PROMS] for mental [bi-weekly] and physical [daily] symptoms were collected using SMS text or email [per patient preference]. Exit surveys and interviews evaluated the patient experience. RESULTS: Ten patients were observed for an average of 58 days and half [N = 5] were monitored for 8 weeks or more. Five patients [50%] had been hospitalized with COVID [mean stay = 41 days] and 4 [36%] had required mechanical ventilation. As baseline, patients had moderate to severe levels of anxiety, depression, and stress; fatigue and shortness of breath were the most prevalent physical symptoms. Four patients [40%] already owned a smartwatch. In total, 575 patient days of patient monitoring occurred across 10 patients. Biosensor data was usable for 91.3% of study hours and surveys were completed 82.1% and 78.7% of the time for physical and mental symptoms, respectively. Positive correlations were observed between stress and resting heart rate [r = 0.360, p<0.01], stress and daily steps [r = 0.335, p<0.01], and anxiety and daily steps [r = 0.289, p<0.01]. There was a trend toward negative correlation between sleep time and physical symptom burden [r = -0.211, p = 0.05]. Patients reported an overall positive experience and identified the potential for wearable devices to improve medical safety and access to care. Concerns around data privacy/security were infrequent. CONCLUSIONS: We report excellent feasibility characteristics for wrist-worn biosensors and e-PROMS as a possible substrate for multi-modal disease tracking in post-COVID conditions. Adapting consumer-grade wearables for medical use and scalable remote patient monitoring holds great potential."

The Collaborative Aging Research Using Technology (CART) initiative was introduced to establish a digital technology research platform that could widely assess activity in the homes of diverse cohorts of older adults and detect meaningful change longitudinally. This paper reports on the built end-to-end design of the CART platform, its functionality, and the resulting research capabilities. METHODS: CART platform development followed a principled design process aiming for scalability, use case flexibility, longevity, and data privacy protection while allowing sharability. The platform, comprising ambient technology, wearables, and other sensors, was deployed in participants' homes to provide continuous, long-term (months to years), and ecologically valid data. Data gathered from CART homes were sent securely to a research server for analysis and future data sharing. RESULTS: The CART system was created, iteratively tested, and deployed to 232 homes representing four diverse cohorts (African American, Latinx, low-income, and predominantly rural-residing veterans) of older adults (n = 301) across the USA. Multiple measurements of wellness such as cognition (e.g., mean daily computer use time = 160-169 min), physical mobility (e.g., mean daily transitions between rooms = 96-155), sleep (e.g., mean nightly sleep duration = 6.3-7.4 h), and level of social engagement (e.g., reports of overnight visitors = 15-45%) were collected across cohorts. CONCLUSION: The CART initiative resulted in a minimally obtrusive digital health-enabled system that met the design principles while allowing for data capture over extended periods and can be widely used by the research community. The ability to monitor and manage health digitally within the homes of older adults is an important alternative to in-person assessments in many research contexts. Further advances will come with wider, shared use of the CART system in additional settings, within different disease contexts, and by diverse research teams."

This article presents a novel architecture that integrates PUF, blockchain, and Tangle for Security-by-Design (SbD) of healthcare cyber-physical systems (H-CPSs). Healthcare systems around the world have undergone massive technological transformation and have seen growing adoption with the advancement of Internet-of-Medical Things (IoMT). The technological transformation of healthcare systems to telemedicine, e-health, connected health, and remote health is being made possible with the sophisticated integration of IoMT with machine learning, big data, artificial intelligence (AI), and other technologies. As healthcare systems are becoming more accessible and advanced, security and privacy have become pivotal for the smooth integration and functioning of various systems in H-CPSs. In this work, we present a novel approach that integrates PUF with IOTA Tangle and blockchain and works by storing the PUF keys of a patient's Body Area Network (BAN) inside blockchain to access, store, and share globally. Each patient has a network of smart wearables and a gateway to obtain the physiological sensor data securely. To facilitate communication among various stakeholders in healthcare systems, IOTA Tangle's Masked Authentication Messaging (MAM) communication protocol has been used, which securely enables patients to communicate, share, and store data on Tangle. The MAM channel works in the restricted mode in the proposed architecture, which can be accessed using the patient's gateway PUF key. Furthermore, the successful verification of PUF enables patients to securely send and share physiological sensor data from various wearable and implantable medical devices embedded with PUF. Finally, healthcare system entities like physicians, hospital admin networks, and remote monitoring systems can securely establish communication with patients using MAM and retrieve the patient's BAN PUF keys from the blockchain securely. Our experimental analysis shows that the proposed approach successfully integrates three security primitives, PUF, blockchain, and Tangle, providing decentralized access control and security in H-CPS with minimal energy requirements, data storage, and response time."

The advent of IoT-based wearable and multimedia sensors has prevented millions of mishapsthrough seamless and systematic monitoring. An IoT-based monitoring system is composed of several sensor devices to measure vital signs, fall detection, energy consumption, and visual recognition. As the data collected by the sensors are transmitted to cloud storage through the Internet, data security is a major concern when transmitting data from remote locations. To improve data security and prediction accuracy, in this study, we proposed a smart and secure multimedia IoT monitoring system for smart homes backed up by smart grid supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA). The proposed system employs state-of-the-art IoT microcontrollers and hardware devices and integrates them in a manner that significantly affects the accuracy and speed of the entire system. Furthermore, the information gathered from IoT is securely transferred through private channels and stored on the cloud, which can be accessed authentically and reliably using an information system built into an IoT application. The output was extensively compared in terms of power consumption and delivery ratio, which were based on the values collected with sequence numbers. The comparative analysis demonstrated that the proposed approach provides increased prediction accuracy and better security. Hence, the proposed powerefficient prototype model monitors the entire smart home environment in real time and serves as an early warning system for critical situations."

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to characterize clinical correlates associated with HR change in the subacute period among patients recovering from AMI. METHODS: HR measurements were collected from 91 patients (4447 HR recordings) enrolled in the MiCORE study using the Apple Watch and Corrie smartphone application. Mixed regression models were used to estimate the associations of patient-level characteristics during hospital admission with HR changes over 30 days postdischarge. RESULTS: The mean daily HR at admission was 78.0 beats per minute (bpm) (95% confidence interval 76.1 to 79.8), declining 0.2 bpm/day (-0.3 to -0.1) under a linear model of HR change. History of coronary artery bypass graft, history of depression, or being discharged on anticoagulants was associated with a higher admission HR. Having a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), or hyperlipidemia was associated with a slower decrease in HR over time, but not with HR during admission. CONCLUSION: While a declining HR was observed in AMI patients over 30 days postdischarge, patients with hypertension, T2DM, or hyperlipidemia showed a slower decrease in HR relative to their counterparts. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using wearables to model the recovery process of patients with AMI and represents a first step in helping pinpoint patients vulnerable to decompensation."

Recently several wearable gadgets are used frequently and become popular in health monitoring systems. In the monitoring system, Biomedical Sensor Nodes (BSN) are used to sense the physiological parameters of the patients and transmitted to the coordinator or Base Station (BS) via the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) frameworks for further analysis. BSNs are energy-constrained and the most amount of energy is consumed due to their information transmissions. Therefore, a key research problem is to reduce energy consumption and communication costs. Moreover, patient data, transmitted over the insecure channel may lead to security threats. Therefore, ensuring data privacy and integrity is another challenging issue. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient and secure health monitoring system to reduce the energy consumption and communication cost of the monitoring system. On the other hand, it also provides secured data transmission by incorporating a Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) based lightweight security mechanism. Extensive simulation results reveal that the proposed scheme achieved improved performance in terms of network lifetime by 27%, average End-to-end delay by 18%, and average network throughput by 23%. In conclusion, our proposed algorithms prove to be a feasible solution for securing and extending the IoMT network lifetime. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

Telehealth prevalence and use increased during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, familiarity with and use of telehealth and health-related mobile applications (apps) by persons with epilepsy remain unknown. Methods: We investigated telehealth use, demographics, and clinical variables within the multicenter Epi2020 cross-sectional study. Between October and December 2020, adults with epilepsy completed a validated questionnaire, including individual questions regarding knowledge and use of apps and telehealth. Results: Of 476 included individuals (58.2% women; mean age 40.2 ± 15.4 years), 41.6% reported using health-related apps. Health apps were used more frequently (pedometer 32.1%, exercise app 17.6%) than medical apps (health insurance 15.1%, menstrual apps 12.2%) or apps designed for epilepsy (medication reminders 10.3%, seizure calendars 4.6%). Few used seizure detectors (i.e., apps as medical devices 1.9%) or mobile health devices (fitness bracelet 11.3%). A majority (60.9%) had heard the term telehealth, 78.6% of whom had a positive view. However, only 28.6% had a concrete idea of telehealth, and only 16.6% reported personal experience with telehealth. A majority (55%) would attend a teleconsultation follow-up, and 41.2% would in a medical emergency. Data privacy and availability were considered equally important by 50.8%, 21.8% considered data privacy more important, and 20.2% considered data availability more important. Current health-related app use was independently associated with younger age (p = 0.003), higher education (p < 0.001), and subjective COVID-19-related challenges (p = 0.002). Persistent seizure occurrence (vs. seizure freedom ≥12 months) did not affect willingness to use teleconsultations on multivariable logistic regression analysis. Conclusions: Despite positive telehealth views, few persons with epilepsy in Germany are familiar with specific apps or services. Socioeconomic factors influence telehealth use more than baseline epilepsy characteristics. Telehealth education and services should target socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals to reduce the digital care gap.

By using this method, the research seeks to improve real-time data processing, minimize latency, maximize resource use, and improve security in healthcare monitoring by retaining confidential data closer to its source. The goal of the study is to show how this strategy might result in healthcare monitoring systems that are more effective and efficient, especially when quick decisions and great data security are required. The proposed technique dynamically offloads computation tasks to fog nodes based on real-time network conditions, resource availability, and task characteristics. It emphasizes the achievement of superior performance metrics including the shortest job completion time, lowest energy consumption, and minimal cost compared to existing task offloading methods within healthcare contexts. The technique notably achieves a reduction of up to 31.1% in task completion time, 66.67% in energy consumption, and 20% in execution time ratio compared to existing task offloading methods in healthcare contexts. Additionally, it improves response time by 40%, demonstrating superior performance metrics. It conducts a thorough assessment of the proposed technique’s effectiveness through key performance indicators such as Task Completion Time, Energy Consumption, Execution Time Ratio, and Response Time Analysis. Finally, a detailed comparative analysis against established techniques enriches the discussion, providing valuable insights into the superiority of the proposed technique. ©EverScience Publications."

These requirements are fulfilled by portable (wearable) patient devices, with low consumption, which transmit data wirelessly, at a short distance, to a mobile communication device (GSM) and through it, to a remote end recipient - doctor, medical center or a hospital server. The data transfer technology requires the monitored person to perform a sequence of actions, such as: selecting the appropriate application on the mobile phone, establishing a connection between the patient module and the phone, recording the data in the phone's memory, starting the data transfer from the phone to the final receiver. Practice shows that often this sequence of activities is difficult for elderly people and especially for visually impaired people, which as a result compromises the remote monitoring process. In this paper are presented an approach and conceptual implementation of a system for remote monitoring of cardiac activity, using the most popular way of remote connectivity - voice (sound) communication. In addition to the ease of use, this type of communication does not require special data protection, due to the lack of RF interfaces for short-distance data transmission.

Healthcare providers are increasingly utilizing wearable technologies to expedite the process of diagnosis and treatment. The healthcare and research fields have been substantially impacted by emerging technologies. On the other hand, there are legitimate worries regarding the security of data transfers and transaction recording upon using these technologies. Healthcare departments need easy data interchange for interoperability. Protecting data security and integrity is crucial when exchanging information with authorized parties. In many existing solutions, patients’ sensitive data is collected and stored in smart healthcare systems. Scalability, breach or unauthorized access to this data can compromise privacy. The adoption of blockchain technology is one way to safeguard patient privacy in healthcare. Also, by facilitating the safe and secure exchange of data, blockchain technology is revolutionizing the healthcare industry by making traditional methods of diagnosis and treatment more reliable. However, blockchain has serious problems with its highly limited scalability. This article suggests a new method “SHORTBLOCKS” depending on blockchain technology for the safe administration and analysis of data. To circumvent the security-scalability issue and achieve high throughput, this study employs the newly introduced protocol “SHORTBLOCKS”, which extends blockchain concept to a direct acyclic graph of blocks. The proposed system uses both a private and a public blockchain that are created on the new protocol. In order to analyze patient health data, a system using smart contracts and a private blockchain is built. The system logs the occurrence to the public blockchain in the case that the smart contract raises an alarm due to an unusual reading.

Wearable Internet of Things (IoT) devices can reliably measure patients' heart rhythms by producing electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Due to their non-invasive nature, ECG signals have been frequently employed to detect arrhythmias. The manual procedure, however, takes a long time and is prone to error. Utilizing deep learning models for early automatic identification of cardiac arrhythmias is a preferable approach that will improve diagnosis and therapy. Though ECG analysis using cloud-based methods can perform satisfactorily, they still suffer from security issues. It is essential to provide secure data transmission and storage for IoT medical data because of its significant development in the healthcare system. So, this paper proposes a secure arrhythmia classification system with the help of effective encryption and a deep learning (DL) system. The proposed method mainly involved two phases: ECG signal transmission and arrhythmia disease classification. In the ECG signal transmission phase, the patient's ECG data collected through the IoT sensors is encrypted using the optimal key-based elgamal elliptic curve cryptography (OKEGECC) mechanism, and the encrypted data is securely transmitted to the cloud. After that, in the arrhythmia disease classification phase, the system collects the data from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology-Beth Israel Hospital (MIT-BIH) database to perform training. The collected data is preprocessed by applying the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to improve the quality of the ECG data. Next, the feature extraction is carried out by deformable attention-centered residual network 50 (DARNet-50), and finally, the classification is performed using butterfly-optimized Bi-directional long short-term memory (BOBLSTM). The experimental outcomes showed that the proposed system achieves 99.76% accuracy, which is better than the existing related schemes.  © 2024 - IOS Press. All rights reserved."

Similar to the European General Data Protection Regulation, in Brazil, the Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados established rules and guidelines for the processing of personal data, including those used for patient care, such as those captured by smartwatches. Thus, in any telemonitoring scenario, there is a need to comply with rules and regulations, making this issue a challenge to overcome. Objective: This study aimed to build a digital solution model for capturing data from wearable devices and making them available in a safe and agile manner for clinical and research use, following current laws. Methods: A functional model was built following the Brazilian Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados (2018), where data captured by smartwatches can be transmitted anonymously over the Internet of Things and be identified later within the hospital. A total of 80 volunteers were selected for a 24-week follow-up clinical trial divided into 2 groups, one group with a previous diagnosis of COVID-19 and a control group without a previous diagnosis of COVID-19, to measure the synchronization rate of the platform with the devices and the accuracy and precision of the smartwatch in out-of-hospital conditions to simulate remote monitoring at home. Results: In a 35-week clinical trial, >11.2 million records were collected with no system downtime; 66% of continuous beats per minute were synchronized within 24 hours (79% within 2 days and 91% within a week). In the limit of agreement analysis, the mean differences in oxygen saturation, diastolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure, and heart rate were -1.280% (SD 5.679%), -1.399 (SD 19.112) mm Hg, -1.536 (SD 24.244) mm Hg, and 0.566 (SD 3.114) beats per minute, respectively. Furthermore, there was no difference in the 2 study groups in terms of data analysis (neither using the smartwatch nor the gold-standard devices), but it is worth mentioning that all volunteers in the COVID-19 group were already cured of the infection and were highly functional in their daily work life. Conclusions: On the basis of the results obtained, considering the validation conditions of accuracy and precision and simulating an extrahospital use environment, the functional model built in this study is capable of capturing data from the smartwatch and anonymously providing it to health care services, where they can be treated according to the legislation and be used to support clinical decisions during remote monitoring. © JMIR Formative Research.All rights reserved."

However, the transmission of medical text data is extremely vulnerable to security and privacy assaults due to the open nature of the underlying communication medium. Therefore, a certificate-less aggregation-based signature system has been proposed as a solution to the issue by using elliptic curve public key cryptography (ECC) which allows for a highly effective technique.

The technological transformation of healthcare systems to telemedicine, e-health, connected health, and remote health is being made possible with the sophisticated integration of IoMT with machine learning, big data, artificial intelligence (AI), and other technologies. As healthcare systems are becoming more accessible and advanced, security and privacy have become pivotal for the smooth integration and functioning of various systems in H-CPSs. In this work, we present a novel approach that integrates PUF with IOTA Tangle and blockchain and works by storing the PUF keys of a patient’s Body Area Network (BAN) inside blockchain to access, store, and share globally. Each patient has a network of smart wearables and a gateway to obtain the physiological sensor data securely. To facilitate communication among various stakeholders in healthcare systems, IOTA Tangle’s Masked Authentication Messaging (MAM) communication protocol has been used, which securely enables patients to communicate, share, and store data on Tangle. The MAM channel works in the restricted mode in the proposed architecture, which can be accessed using the patient’s gateway PUF key. Furthermore, the successful verification of PUF enables patients to securely send and share physiological sensor data from various wearable and implantable medical devices embedded with PUF. Finally, healthcare system entities like physicians, hospital admin networks, and remote monitoring systems can securely establish communication with patients using MAM and retrieve the patient’s BAN PUF keys from the blockchain securely.

The feasibility characteristics for wrist-worn biosensors are poorly described for post-COVID conditions and rural populations. Methods We prospectively recruited patients in rural communities who were enrolled in an at-home rehabilitation program for post-COVID conditions. They were asked to wear a FitBit Charge 2 device and biosensor parameters were analyzed [e.g. heart rate, sleep, and activity]. Electronic patient reported outcome measures [E-PROMS] for mental [bi-weekly] and physical [daily] symptoms were collected using SMS text or email [per patient preference]. Exit surveys and interviews evaluated the patient experience. Results Ten patients were observed for an average of 58 days and half [N = 5] were monitored for 8 weeks or more. Five patients [50%] had been hospitalized with COVID [mean stay = 41 days] and 4 [36%] had required mechanical ventilation. As baseline, patients had moderate to severe levels of anxiety, depression, and stress; fatigue and shortness of breath were the most prevalent physical symptoms.

Intense monitoring of patients at home, social distancing, and resource rationalization provided great help to medical personnel and healthcare systems. This novel disease, however, has posed new challenges, given by the quicker evolution of a patient's clinical status with respect to chronic diseases. In particular, the updates of the care plan performed remotely by doctors need to be immediately delivered to monitoring kits located at the patient's home, in order to adjust the monitoring plan of the target patient.

Many countries have postponed their public screening programs and are fighting to maintain balance between essential health care and COVID-19 pandemic.

IoT based wearable devices collect data and send them to the cloud via IoT Gateway. Further, the data are analyzed by AI to raise alerts at times of emergencies like a sudden drop-in pulse rate etc. AI needs a large database for training and processing. This threatens the patient’s data security and privacy. To overcome this threat, an encryption algorithm can be used. When it comes to remote healthcare, monitoring of cardio vascular muscles is the most important of all. This can be done by an electrocardiogram (ECG). These ECG signals are transmitted in case of emergency and are stored in remote servers. The ECG signals are unique in nature and they can be used in biometric devices which attract hackers. To avoid the intruders, the data is encrypted and transmitted. In this paper, we provide a lightweight cellular automaton (CA) based encryption algorithm to suit limited power and low memory devices.

Besides sensing, a number of solutions for e-textile garments have also integrated wireless interfaces, allowing sensing data to be transmitted, and also inbuilt capacitive touch sensors, allowing users to provide instructions. While this has provided a new level of sensing that can result in unprecedented applications, there has been little attention placed around on-body edge computing for e-textiles. This study focuses on the need for a noninvasive and remote health-monitoring solution with inbuilt on-body edge computing, and how enabling such sensing and computing capabilities in a fabric environment can act as a new method for healthcare monitoring through the use of embedded computing intelligence in smart garments. Facilitating computing in e-textiles can result in a new form of on-body edge computing, where sensor information is processed very close to the body before being transmitted to an external device or wireless access point. This form of computing can provide new security and data privacy capabilities and, at the same time, provide opportunities for new energy-harvesting mechanisms to process the data through the garment. This study proposes this concept through embroidered programmable logic arrays (PLAs) integrated into e-textiles. In the same way that PLAs have programmable logic circuits by interconnecting different AND, NOT, and OR gates, we propose e-textile–based gates that are sewn into a garment and connected through conductive thread stitching. Two designs are proposed, and this includes single- and multi-layered PLAs. Experimental validations have been conducted at the individual gates and the entire PLA circuits to determine the voltage utilization and logic computing reliability. The multilayered PLA garment superseded the single-layered garment with higher levels of accuracy in the yielded results due to the enhanced design layout, which reduces the potential for short circuits and errors occurring. Our proposed approach can usher in a new form of on-body edge computing for e-textile garments for future wearable technologies, and, in particular, with the current pandemic that requires noninvasive remote health-monitoring applications.

The protocol also allows emergency access that results in the graceful degradation of offered services without compromising security and patient safety. The performance of the security protocol as well as its feasibility and impact on modern IMDs are extensively analyzed and evaluated.

This emerging technology has not only relieved the burden of hospital resources, but also paved the way for efficient monitoring and management of patients. According to World Health Organization (WHO), in Pakistan, cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are leading cause of deaths that amount to nearly 200,000 deaths annually. This results in high mortality rates all over Pakistan. To uplift the current architecture of healthcare in Pakistan, it is vital to develop a sustainable solution for continuous health monitoring and arrest anomalous physiological behavior before they become life-threatening. In the same pretext, this study proposes a working paper which aims to disseminate interim results of smart cardiac health monitoring using an amalgam of IoMT and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The primary objective of the proposed research is to integrate state-of-the-art ML classification algorithms to detect, in near real-time, abnormal human vitals like electrocardiogram(ECG), heart-rate(HR), blood pressure(BP), etc. As network latency is critical to this application, therefore, to improve overall Quality of Service (QoS) of the system, we propose to fuse Edge Intelligence interfaced with multiple IoMT enabled bio-sensors. These sensors will form a body area sensor network(BSN) that records cardiac-related human vitals. In our preliminary research, that is presented in this paper, we trained several machine learning algorithms on the MIMIC-III clinical data-set and reviewed their performance. Among the 7 tested supervised classification algorithms, Random-Forest achieved the highest accuracy of 95% on the test set.

These devices are widely used to ensure remote patient monitoring. The current implementation is based on a client/server architecture. This raises several challenges regarding security and privacy that make healthcare systems more susceptible to several attacks. Therefore, health data are subject to strict regulatory and security requirements. To overcome these challenges and comply with security regulations, the adoption of a distributed architecture is a necessity. Due to its distributed nature and its security promises, Blockchain has a large interest as a sophisticated technology to solve the security challenges in IoT-based systems. Motivated by these factors, this work proposes BlockMedCare, a secure healthcare system that integrates IoT with Blockchain. The system is designed to support remote patient monitoring, especially when it comes to chronic diseases that require regular monitoring. We took into consideration three main parameters: security, scalability, and processing time. The security is ensured by using the re-encryption proxy combined with Blockchain to store hash data. Smart contracts are used for access control. To ensure Blockchain scalability, an off-chain database based on IPFS is used to store data. To speed up the data storage process, we use an Ethereum Blockchain-based proof of authority. As a use case, we applied the system to diabetes management and showed the execution results based on the system interfaces. The experimental system has demonstrated a good improvement of healthcare systems in terms of security face to the existing methods. © 2022"

To deal with these existing issues, we propose a decentralized, efficient, and privacy-enhanced federated edge learning system called DEEP-FEL, which enables medical devices in different institutions to collaboratively train a global model without raw data mutual exchange. Firstly, we design a hierarchical ring topology to alleviate centralization of the conventional training framework, and formulate the ring construction as an optimization problem, which can be solved by an efficient heuristic algorithm. Subsequently, we design an efficient parameter aggregation algorithm for distributed medical institutions to generate a new global model, and the total amount of data transmitted by N nodes is only 2/N times that of traditional algorithm. In addition, data security among different medical institutions is enhanced by adding artificial noise to the edge model.

For instance, recent human activity recognition (HAR) research has explored using wearable devices in applications such as remote monitoring of patients, detection of gait abnormalities, and cognitive disease identification. However, data collection poses a major challenge in developing HAR systems, especially because of the need to store data at a central location. This raises privacy concerns and makes continuous data collection difficult and expensive due to the high cost of transferring data from a user's wearable device to a central repository. Considering this, we explore the adoption of federated learning (FL) as a potential solution to address the privacy and cost issues associated with data collection in HAR. More specifically, we investigate the performance and behavioral differences between FL and deep learning (DL) HAR models, under various conditions relevant to real-world deployments. Namely, we explore the differences between the two types of models when (i) using data from different sensor placements, (ii) having access to users with data from heterogeneous sensor placements, (iii) considering bandwidth efficiency, and (iv) dealing with data with incorrect labels. Our results show that FL models suffer from a consistent performance deficit in comparison to their DL counterparts, but achieve these results with much better bandwidth efficiency. Furthermore, we observe that FL models exhibit very similar responses to those of DL models when exposed to data from heterogeneous sensor placements. Finally, we show that the FL models are more robust to data with incorrect labels than their centralized DL counterparts.  © 2013 IEEE."

The recognition of human activities from IoT is an important building block in this context. While the analysis of the generated datastream can have many benefits from a health point of view, it can also lead to privacy threats by exposing highly sensitive information. In this article, we propose a framework that relies on machine learning to efficiently recognise the user activity, useful for personal healthcare monitoring, while limiting the risk of users re-identification from biometric patterns characterizing each individual. To achieve that, we show that features in temporal domain are useful to discriminate user activity while features in frequency domain lead to distinguish the user identity. We then design a novel protection mechanism processing the raw signal on the user's smartphone to select relevant features for activity recognition and normalise features sensitive to re-identification. These unlinkable features are then transferred to the application server. We extensively evaluate our framework with reference datasets: Results show an accurate activity recognition (87%) while limiting the re-identification rate (33%).

These remote data sources consist of physiological processes, such as treatment progress, patient monitoring, and consultation. The main purpose of IoHT platform is to intervene independently from geographically remote areas by providing low-cost preventive or active healthcare services. Several low-power biomedical sensors with limited computing capabilities provide IoHT's communication, integration, computation, and interoperability. However, IoHT transfers IoT data via IP-centric Internet, which has implications for security and privacy. To address this issue, in this paper, we suggest using named data networking (NDN), a future Internet model that is well suited for mobile patients and caregivers. As the IoHT contains a lot of personal information about a user's physical condition, which can be detrimental to users' finances and health if leaked, therefore, data protection is important in the IoHT. Experts and scholars have researched this area, but the reconstruction of existing schemes could be further improved. Also, doing computing-intensive tasks leads to slower response times, which further worsens the performance of IoHT. We are trying to resolve such an error, so a new NDN-based certificateless signcryption scheme is proposed for IoHT using the security hardness of the hyperelliptic curve cryptosystem. Security analysis and comparisons with existing schemes show the viability of the designed scheme. The final results confirm that the designed scheme provides better security with minimal computational and communicational resources.

Also, enabled by technological advancements and electronics miniaturization, wearable health device (WHD) applications are expected to grow exponentially. This, in turn, may make 4P medicine (predictive, precise, preventive and personalized) a more attainable goal within dialysis patient care. This article discusses different use cases where WHD could be of relevance for dialysis patient care, i.e. measurement of heart rate, arrhythmia detection, blood pressure, hyperkalaemia, fluid overload and physical activity. After adequate validation of the different WHD in this specific population, data obtained from WHD could form part of a body area network (BAN), which could serve different purposes such as feedback on actionable parameters like physical inactivity, fluid overload, danger signalling or event prediction. For a BAN to become clinical reality, not only must technical issues, cybersecurity and data privacy be addressed, but also adequate models based on artificial intelligence and mathematical analysis need to be developed for signal optimization, data representation, data reliability labelling and interpretation. Moreover, the potential of WHD and BAN can only be fulfilled if they are part of a transformative healthcare system with a shared responsibility between patients, healthcare providers and the payors, using a step-up approach that may include digital assistants and dedicated 'digital clinics'.

Remote monitoring technologies (RMTs), such as smartphone applications, wearables, and home-based sensors, can change these periodic subjective assessments to more frequent, or even continuous, objective monitoring. The aim of the RADAR-AD study is to assess the accuracy and validity of RMTs in measuring functional decline in a real-world environment across preclinical-to-moderate stages of AD compared to standard clinical rating scales. Methods: This study includes three tiers. For the main study, we will include participants (n = 220) with preclinical AD, prodromal AD, mild-to-moderate AD, and healthy controls, classified by MMSE and CDR score, from clinical sites equally distributed over 13 European countries. Participants will undergo extensive neuropsychological testing and physical examination.

In the first sub-study, fixed sensors will be installed in the homes of a representative sub-sample of 40 participants. In the second sub-study, 10 participants will stay in a smart home for 1 week. The primary outcome of this study is the difference in functional domain profiles assessed using RMTs between the four study groups. The four participant groups will be compared for each RMT outcome measure separately. Each RMT outcome will be compared to a standard clinical test which measures the same functional or cognitive domain. Finally, multivariate prediction models will be developed. Data collection and privacy are important aspects of the project, which will be managed using the RADAR-base data platform running on specifically designed biomedical research computing infrastructure. Results: First results are expected to be disseminated in 2022. Conclusion: Our study is well placed to evaluate the clinical utility of RMT assessments. Leveraging modern-day technology may deliver new and improved methods for accurately monitoring functional decline in all stages of AD.

Materials and Methods: During April 2021, an extensive search for articles for Internet of Medical Things (IoMTs), medical devices, Internet of Things (IoTs) with biosensors either in title or in keywords was done using PubMed, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, and Web of Science databases. Studies were categorized into two types: those evaluating the clinical outcomes of IoMTs and those evaluating the technological basis of IoMTs. Results: IoMT architecture was reviewed under four headings: sensors, IoT gateway/framework, machine learning, and reporting tools. IoMT classification based on place of usage (body centric IoMTs, hospital IoMTs with point of care kiosks, and ubiquitous IoMTs), based on the system-wise application (cardiovascular, renal, pulmonary, endocrine, medication) and based on outcomes (fitness-alone IoMTs, clinical grading and monitoring IoMTs, and remote patient monitoring IoMTs) is proposed.

This has increased the need for remote memory clinics, we therefore review the literature, current practices and guidelines on organizing such remote memory clinics, focusing on assessment of cognition, function and other relevant measurements, proposing a novel pathway based on three levels of complexity: simple telephone or video-based interviews and testing using available tests (Level 1), digitized and validated methods based on standard pen-and-paper tests and scales (Level 2), and finally fully digitized cognitive batteries and remote measurement technologies (RMTs, Level 3). Pros and cons of these strategies are discussed. Remotely collected data negates the need for frail patients or carers to commute to clinic and offers valuable insights into progression over time, as well as treatment responses to therapeutic interventions, providing a more realistic and contextualized environment for data-collection. Notwithstanding several challenges related to internet access, computer skills, limited evidence base and regulatory and data protection issues, digital biomarkers collected remotely have significant potential for diagnosis and symptom management in older adults and we propose a framework and pathway for how technologies can be implemented to support remote memory clinics. These platforms are also well-placed for administration of digital cognitive training and other interventions. The individual, societal and public/private costs of COVID-19 are high and will continue to rise for some time but the challenges the pandemic has placed on memory services also provides an opportunity to embrace novel approaches. Remote memory clinics’ financial, logistical, clinical and practical benefits have been highlighted by COVID-19, supporting their use to not only be maintained when social distancing legislation is lifted but to be devoted extra resources and attention to fully potentiate this valuable arm of clinical assessment and care. © Copyright © 2020 Owens, Ballard, Beigi, Kalafatis, Brooker, Lavelle, Brønnick, Sauer, Boddington, Velayudhan and Aarsland."

With a growing body of supportive clinical studies, advances in digital inhaler sensors and platforms, greater support from payers and healthcare organizations, significant growth with these technologies is expected. While all digital (smart) inhalers record adherence, these are distinguished by their compatibility with commercial inhalers, capabilities to guide inhaler technique, use of patient-reported outcomes, and user-friendliness for both the healthcare professional (HCP) and patient. Due to the complexity and novelty of employing digital inhalers, collaboration with multiple entities within health systems is necessary and a well-planned integration is needed. For HCPs and patients, cybersecurity and privacy are critical, it will require review by each healthcare organization. In the US, some payers reimburse for remote monitoring using digital inhalers, but reimbursement is currently unavailable in other countries. There are several models for remote patient care, as employing an active, ongoing digital interface between the HCP and patient or they may choose to only review data at clinical encounters. Personalization of therapies and feedback are key to success. While digital inhaler malfunction uncommonly occurs, patient attrition over a year is significant. Some patients will be challenged to use digital platforms or have the necessary technology.

Our analysis of health privacy laws indicates that most US patients may have little access to their own digital health data in the United States under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Privacy Rule, whereas the EU General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act grant greater access to device-collected data. Our normative analysis argues for consistently granting patients access to the raw data collected by their implantable devices. Context: Millions of life-sustaining implantable devices collect and relay massive amounts of digital health data, increasingly by using user-downloaded smartphone applications to facilitate data relay to clinicians via manufacturer servers. Whether patients have either legal or normative claims to data collected by these devices, particularly in the raw, granular format beyond that summarized in their medical records, remains incompletely explored. Methods: Using pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) as a clinical model, we outline the clinical ecosystem of data collection, relay, retrieval, and documentation. We consider the legal implications of US and European privacy regulations for patient access to either summary or raw device data. Lastly, we evaluate ethical arguments for or against providing patients access to data beyond the summaries presented in medical records. Findings: Our analysis of applicable health privacy laws indicates that US patients may have little access to their raw data collected and held by device manufacturers in the United States under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Privacy Rule, whereas the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) grants greater access to device-collected data when the processing of personal data falls under the GDPR's territorial scope. The California Consumer Privacy Act, the “little sister” of the GDPR, also grants greater rights to California residents. By contrast, our normative analysis argues for consistently granting patients access to the raw data collected by their implantable devices. Smartphone applications are increasingly involved in the collection, relay, retrieval, and documentation of these data. Therefore, we argue that smartphone user agreements are an emerging but potentially underutilized opportunity for clarifying both legal and ethical claims for device-derived data.

Sensitive data privacy can be achieved by anonymization in order to avoid the security risks, because remote monitoring are requested for the recordings of vital signs and sensitive personal information, such as name, address, telephone, date of birth, social insurance number, health status data, diagnosis results, and treatment schemas. The values of vital signs are useful in statistics for predictive modeling in order to understand and anticipate the behaviors of diseases.

The integration of innovative technologies, such as the Internet of Things, wearable technologies, artificial intelligence, and ambient-assisted living applications, represents a valuable solution for this scope. Designing such an integrated system requires addressing several aspects (eg, equipment selection, data management, analytics, costs, and users'needs) and involving different areas of expertise (eg, medical science, service design, biomedical and computer engineering). Objective: The objective of this study is 2-fold; we aimed to design the functionalities of a smart health platform addressing 5 chronic conditions prevalent in the older population (ie, hearing loss, cardiovascular diseases, cognitive impairments, mental health problems, and balance disorders) by considering both older adults'and clinicians' perspectives and to evaluate the identified smart health platform functionalities with a small group of older adults. Methods: Overall, 24 older adults (aged >65 years) and 118 clinicians were interviewed through focus group activities and web-based questionnaires to elicit the smart health platform requirements. Considering the elicited requirements, the main functionalities of smart health platform were designed. Then, a focus group involving 6 older adults was conducted to evaluate the proposed solution in terms of usefulness, credibility, desirability, and learnability. Results: Eight main functionalities were identified and assessed-cognitive training and hearing training (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 6/6, 100%; learnability: 6/6, 100%), monitoring of physiological parameters (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 6/6, 100%; learnability: 5/6, 83%), physical training (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 5/6, 83%; learnability: 2/6, 33%), psychoeducational intervention (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 4/6, 67%; learnability: 2/6, 33%), mood monitoring (usefulness: 4/6, 67%; credibility: 4/6, 67%; desirability: 3/6, 50%; learnability: 5/6, 50%), diet plan (usefulness: 5/6, 83%; credibility: 4/6, 67%; desirability: 1/6, 17%; learnability: 2/6, 33%), and environment monitoring and adjustment (usefulness: 1/6, 17%; credibility: 1/6, 17%; desirability: 0/6, 0%; learnability: 0/6, 0%). Most of them were highly appreciated by older participants, with the only exception being environment monitoring and adjustment. The results showed that the proposed functionalities met the needs and expectations of users (eg, improved self-management of patients' disease and enhanced patient safety). However, some aspects need to be addressed (eg, technical and privacy issues). Conclusions: The presented smart health platform functionalities seem to be able to meet older adults' needs and desires to enhance their self-awareness and self-management of their medical condition, encourage healthy and independent living, and provide evidence-based support for clinicians' decision-making. Further research with a larger and more heterogeneous pool of stakeholders in terms of demographics and clinical conditions is needed to assess system acceptability and overall user experience in free-living conditions. © 2022 JMIR Publications Inc..

Although mHealth could be used to facilitate the tracking of health changes during pregnancy, challenges remain in data collection compliance and technology engagement among pregnant women. Understanding the interests, preferences, and requirements of pregnant women and those of clinicians is needed when designing and introducing mHealth solutions for supporting pregnant women’s monitoring of health and risk factors throughout their pregnancy journey. Objective: This study aims to understand clinicians’ and pregnant women’s perceptions on the potential use of mHealth, including factors that may influence their engagement with mHealth technologies and the implications for technology design and implementation. Methods: A qualitative study using semistructured interviews was conducted with 4 pregnant women, 4 postnatal women, and 13 clinicians working in perinatal care. Results: Clinicians perceived the potential benefit of mHealth in supporting different levels of health and well-being monitoring, risk assessment, and care provision in pregnancy care. Most pregnant and postnatal female participants were open to the use of wearables and health monitoring devices and were more likely to use these technologies if they knew that clinicians were monitoring their data. Although it was acknowledged that some pregnancy-related medical conditions are suitable for an mHealth model of remote monitoring, the clinical and technical challenges in the introduction of mHealth for pregnancy care were also identified. Incorporating appropriate health and well-being measures, intelligently detecting any abnormalities, and providing tailored information for pregnant women were the critical aspects, whereas usability and data privacy were among the main concerns of the participants.

The medical Internet of Things (MIoT) can be applied to wearable devices, remote diagnosis, mobile medical treatment, and remote monitoring. There is a large amount of medical information in the databases of various medical institutions. Nevertheless, due to the particularity of medical data, it is extremely related to personal privacy, and the data cannot be shared, resulting in data islands. Federated learning (FL), as a distributed collaborative artificial intelligence method, provides a solution. However, FL also involves multiple security and privacy issues. This paper proposes an adaptive Differential Privacy Federated Learning Medical IoT (DPFL-MIoT) model. Specifically, when the user updates the model locally, we propose a differential privacy federated learning deep neural network with adaptive gradient descent (DPFLAGD-DNN) algorithm, which can adaptively add noise to the model parameters according to the characteristics and gradient of the training data. Since privacy leaks often occur in downlink, we present differential privacy federated learning (DP-FL) algorithm where adaptive noise is added to the parameters when the server distributes the parameters. Our method effectively reduces the addition of unnecessary noise, and at the same time, the model has a good effect.

To maximise the use of wearable devices in practice, it is important that they are usable by, and offer value to, all stakeholders. Although previous research has explored participants’ opinions of devices, to date, limited studies have explored the experiences and opinions of the researchers who use and implement them. Researchers offer a unique insight into wearable devices as they may have access to multiple devices and cohorts, and thus gain a thorough understanding as to how and where this area needs to progress. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the experiences and opinions of researchers from academic, industry and clinical contexts, in the use of wearable devices to measure gait and physical activity. Methods: Twenty professionals with experience using wearable devices in research were recruited from academic, industry and clinical backgrounds. Independent, semi-structured interviews were conducted, audio-recorded and transcribed. Transcribed texts were analysed using inductive thematic analysis. Results: Five themes were identified: (1) The positives and negatives of using wearable devices in research, (2) The routine implementation of wearable devices into research and clinical practice, (3) The importance of compromise in protocols, (4) Securing good quality data, and (5) A paradigm shift. Researchers overwhelmingly supported the use of wearable sensor technology due to the insights that they may provide. Though barriers remain, researchers were pragmatic towards these, believing that there is a paradigm shift happening in this area of research that ultimately requires mistakes and significant volumes of further research to allow it to progress. Conclusions: Multiple barriers to the use of wearable devices in research and clinical practice remain, including data management and clear clinical utility. However, researchers strongly believe that the potential benefit of these devices to support and create new clinical insights for patient care, is greater than any current barrier. Multi-disciplinary research integrating the expertise of both academia, industry and clinicians is a fundamental necessity to further develop wearable devices and protocols that match the varied needs of all stakeholders. © 2021, The Author(s)."

The purpose of this review is to describe the current use of telehealth, mobile applications and wearable devices in inflammatory bowel disease and potential future applications. Recent findings Telemedicine was increasingly used during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic. Virtual consultations allowed clinical care to continue despite pandemic-related restrictions without compromising the quality of care for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It also benefits patients who would not have access to care due to financial or geographical barriers. Mobile applications allow patients with IBD to record disease activity among other metrics, allowing for earlier healthcare provider intervention. Wearable devices are increasingly being explored to monitor physiological indicators of disease activity and flare. Summary Telehealth and remote patient monitoring has been successfully integrated into the care of IBD patients. The advantages of these modalities include better access to specialist care and remote noninvasive disease monitoring. Careful consideration must be given to patient privacy, data protection and equitable access. These modalities have enormous potential to improve patient care through accurate consistent data collection and even the prediction of disease activity. Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

As mobile health (mHealth) technology gains universal leverage and popularity, it is becoming more user-friendly for older adults and an adjunct to manage CVD risk and improve overall cardiovascular health. With the rapid advances in mHealth technology and increasing technological engagement of older adults, a comprehensive understanding of the current literature and knowledge of gaps and barriers surrounding the impact of mHealth on secondary CVD prevention is essential. After a systematic review of the literature, 26 studies that used mHealth for secondary CVD prevention focusing on lifestyle behavior change and medication adherence in cohorts with a mean age of ≥60 years were identified. Improvements in health behaviors and medication adherence were observed, particularly when there was a short message service (ie, texting) component involved. Although mobile technologies are becoming more mainstream and are starting to blend more seamlessly with standard health care, there are still distinct barriers that limit implementation particularly in older adults, including affordability, usability, privacy, and security issues. Furthermore, studies on the type of mHealth that is the most effective for older adults with longer study duration are essential as the field continues to grow. As our population ages, identifying and implementing effective, widely accepted, cost-effective, and time-efficient mHealth interventions to improve CVD health in a vulnerable demographic group should be a top health priority. © 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

In health sector, also a lot of research work is going on to transform the traditional health sector into a digital health sector with the help of these new technologies. And the biggest step toward this transformation in health care is remote patient monitoring (RPM). Remote patient monitoring (RPM) is the most powerful tool to observe the patients effectively at any time. RPM allows the healthcare providers to get the real-time monitoring of the patients with the help of sensors, wearable devices, smart phones, etc. Data is a new fuel of twenty-first century, with the implementation of different new technologies in various fields the legitimate concern of data security and privacy of the users is also arise which has to be resolved for maintain the trust of the users. And this research acknowledges this concern seriously and efficiently. The objective of this research is to enhance the security of the data of patients with the help of RSA by preventing the malicious data infusion in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) used in remote patient monitoring architecture, to maintain the integrity and authenticity of data by en-route filtering using RSA and to enhance the efficiency of overall system by minimum use of energy with the help of AODV protocol.

Wearables provides a low-cost and technologically advanced approach to measure sleep over time in free-living conditions, with miniaturized sensors, wireless data transfer protocols, mobile- and cloud-based platform for data management and visualization, and easy integration with other services. The unprecedented amount of data generated by CST has the potential to improve our understanding of sleep and its disorders in natural settings, providing insight into the relationship between sleep, behavior, and health. In parallel with the growing utilization of telemedicine, remote patient monitoring is becoming increasingly relevant in medicine and therefore, the use of CST will likely augment the diagnosis and management of sleep disorders. The ownership of CST by the patient, as opposed to the health system, allows for sleep tracking to take place prior to and between patient-provider interactions, which could transform the current framework of sleep medicine care delivery. Additionally, the use of CST alongside the recording of other health-metrics with digital tools (e.g., blood pressure cuffs, scales, glucometers, mobile apps for symptoms tracking) may ultimately reveal the interactions between sleep and patient comorbidities (e.g., hypertension, diabetes) in ambulatory settings. Despite this potential, CST is largely unregulated and has yet-unsolved intrinsic limitations inherent to a consumer-oriented product. For example, CST lacks major requirements of traditional clinical/research tools, including transparency in the algorithms used, control of, and access to raw data. The scientific community has been actively examining the performance of CST, considering these limitations, and continues to provide guidance on how to move forward with CST in basic and clinical sleep research.

In a short period, real-time applications for healthcare monitoring produce a huge amount of data. Data is to be bursting in the case of critical applications; hence there is a greater need to enable reliable communication methods that ensure energy efficiency. A large amount of data results in high data transmission, network congestion, and latency, which in turn cause a hop increment between the IoT and cloud servers, and thus data might be unprocessed and insufficient for end-users. Since Fog computing is a distributed intermediate layer between the edge network and the cloud environment, latency can be reduced to a remarkable level, and the reliable communication can be achieved with the help of fog computing on IoT assisted wearable sensor platform. This research proposes a dynamic model for analysis and the Heuristic Hybrid Time Slot Fuzzy-Allocation Algorithm (HHTSF-AA), which improves health monitoring by indulging IoT assisted wearable sensor platform. Fog computing assisted wearable sensor platform is the most suitable and reliable platform for robust life-critical applications that are likely not to be delayed in communication.

We performed semi-structured interviews of patients, clinicians, and device clinic technicians involved in clinical remote monitoring of cardiovascular implantable devices at our institution. Twenty-eight interviews comprised of 15 patients and 13 clinicians were conducted from October 2019 through February 2020. Interview transcripts were analyzed using a mixed inductive and deductive approach. Perspectives among clinicians and patients varied regarding familiarity, educational experiences, and preferences regarding how remote monitoring data are handled. Three key domains emerged including knowledge and understanding, managing alerts, and cost transparency. Within these domains, key findings includedvery limited understanding of how remote monitoring functions and how alerts in particular are handled. These knowledge deficits (both patients and providers) appeared to arise in part from different equipment and platforms among manufacturers, the complexity of the technology, and lack of formalized education in remote monitoring. However, interviewees expressed generally high levels of trust in the technology and care systems supporting remote monitoring. Few respondents described concerns around cybersecurity, but patients in particular did raise concerns about cost transparency and frequent billing. In conclusion, conflicting perceptions around remote monitoring persist and indicate important knowledge gaps despite high trust in the care pathway.

Recent advancements in information technology and blockchain technology have revolutionized electronic healthcare research and industry. The innovation of miniaturized healthcare sensors for monitoring patient vital signs has improved and secured the human healthcare system. The increase in portable health devices has enhanced the quality of health-monitoring status both at an activity/fitness level for self-health tracking and at a medical level, providing more data to clinicians with potential for earlier diagnosis and guidance of treatment. When sharing personal medical information, data security and comfort are essential requirements for interaction with and collection of electronic medical records. However, it is hard for current systems to meet these requirements because they have inconsistent security policies and access control structures. The new solutions should be directed towards improving data access, and should be managed by the government in terms of privacy and security requirements to ensure the reliability of data for medical purposes. Blockchain paves the way for a revolution in the traditional pharmaceutical industry and benefits from unique features such as privacy and transparency of data. In this paper, we propose a novel platform for monitoring patient vital signs using smart contracts based on blockchain. The proposed system is designed and developed using hyperledger fabric, which is an enterprise-distributed ledger framework for developing blockchain-based applications. This approach provides several benefits to the patients, such as an extensive, immutable history log, and global access to medical information from anywhere at any time. The Libelium e-Health toolkit is used to acquire physiological data.

Interestingly, no review of attitudes toward telemedicine among older adults has been performed. This is likely to be the group most affected by both cancer and the increasing use of technology in health care. Objective: We aimed to map research on the acceptance of telemedicine among older adults who are cancer patients. Methods: We conducted a scoping review. PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were systematically searched from inception to September 2020. Articles were included if the study population had a mean or median age ≥65 years, with cancer diagnoses and if the study assessed patients’ acceptance of a telemedicine intervention. Quantitative, qualitative, and mixed method studies were included. Results: Out of a total of 887 articles that were identified, 19 were included in the review. Interventions were delivered via telephone, videoconference, web portal, mobile app, wearable technology, and text messaging and included teleconsultation, monitoring and follow-up, psychosocial support and nursing care, and prompts. The most often cited facilitating factor was convenience. Other facilitators included an increase in telemedicine care accessibility, previous positive experiences of telemedicine, appropriate technical knowledge and support, decreased cost, physician recommendations, and privacy conferred by the telemedicine intervention. Barriers include a preference for conventional care along with negative perceptions of telemedicine, concerns about technical difficulties, and confidentiality concerns in the adoption of telemedicine. Conclusions: None of the studies explored the ability of tailored interventions to address facilitators and barriers of the acceptance of telemedicine in order to increase its adoption by older adults. Facilitators and barriers will likely differ across different cultural contexts and by type of telemedicine; however, this is a gap in current knowledge. In-depth studies are necessary to determine if interventions could potentially address the barriers identified in this review, to increase acceptability. © 2022 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has eased the situation to a great extent, also COVID-19 has motivated scientists to make new ‘Smart’ healthcare system focusing towards early diagnosis, prevention of spread, education and treatment and facilitate living in the new normal. This review aims to identify the role of IoMT applications in improving healthcare system and to analyze the status of research demonstrating effectiveness of IoMT benefits to the patient and healthcare system along with a brief insight into technologies supplementing IoMT and challenges faced in developing a smart healthcare system. An internet-based search in PUBMED, Google Scholar and IEEE Library for english language publications using relevant terms resulted in 987 articles. After screening title, abstract, and content related to IoMT in healthcare and excluding duplicate articles, 135 articles published in journal with impact factor ≥1 were eligible for inclusion. Also relevant articles from the references of the selected articles were considered. The habituation of IoMT and related technology has resolved several difficulties using remote monitoring, telemedicine, robotics, sensors etc. However mass adoption seems challenging due to factors like privacy and security of data, management of large amount of data, scalability and upgradation etc. Although ample knowledge has been compiled and exchanged, this structured systematic review will help the healthcare practitioners, policymakers/decision makers, scientists and researchers to gauge the applicability of IoMT in healthcare more efficiently. © 2021 Craniofacial Research Foundation"

The ECMO device used was the SP-200 (Terumo Corp.) because initially its information could not be directly acquired for remote monitoring. In addition, the data management system (DMS) is a software that runs on a tablet PC and can collectively manage and display device information. Therefore, we used the screen output of a tablet PC running DMS to acquire the device information of SP-200 with OCR.A Raspberry Pi 4 Model B was used to capture the laptop PC display output that displayed a DMS image and read the device information with OCR. The captured image was then processed with Raspberry Pi into an image suitable for OCR. By reading with OCR, it was possible to acquire device information from a device from which it was initially not possible to directly do so.  © 2022 IEEE."

It utilizes smart medical devices and cloud computing services along with core Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to sense patients' vital body parameters, monitor health conditions and generate multivariate data to support just-in-time health services. Mostly, this large amount of data is analyzed in centralized servers. Anomaly Detection (AD) in a centralized healthcare ecosystem is often plagued by significant delays in response time with high performance overhead. Moreover, there are inherent privacy issues associated with sending patients' personal health data to a centralized server, which may also introduce several security threats to the AD model, such as possibility of data poisoning. To overcome these issues with centralized AD models, here we propose a Federated Learning (FL) based AD model which utilizes edge cloudlets to run AD models locally without sharing patients' data. Since existing FL approaches perform aggregation on a single server which restricts the scope of FL, in this paper, we introduce a hierarchical FL that allows aggregation at different levels enabling multi-party collaboration. We introduce a novel disease-based grouping mechanism where different AD models are grouped based on specific types of diseases. Furthermore, we develop a new Federated Time Distributed (FEDTIMEDIS) Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) approach to train the AD model. We present a Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) use case to demonstrate our model, and illustrate a proof-of-concept implementation using Digital Twin (DT) and edge cloudlets.  © 2021 IEEE."

The need for further investigation, monitoring and therapeutic management are advancing practical issues which had not been identified for consideration prior to the pandemic. Using the marketing assessment, we identified the needs of the patients and evaluated the future steps necessary in the short term to meet them. The research found progress made via telemedicine in monitoring and conducting minor decisions (like up-titrating the doses of different medication regimens) in patients with several cardiovascular diseases (heart failure, atrial fibrillation, high blood pressure), as there is a worldwide trend to develop new telemonitoring biosensors and devices based on implantable delivered transcatheter. The worldwide telemedicine trend encourages a switch from small and hesitating steps to a more consistent assessment of the patients, based on high technology and Interventional Cardiology. Cardiovascular telemedicine, although made a sustainable effort in managing patients' health, has many obstacles to overcome before meeting all their needs. Data security, confidentiality and reimbursement are the top priorities in developing remote Cardiology. The regulatory institutions need to play an integrative role in leading the way for defining the framework of future telemedicine activities. The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak with all its tragedy served to reinforce the message that telemedicine services can be life-saving for cardiovascular patients. Once the Covid-19 era will fade away, telemedicine is likely to remain a complementary service of standard care. There is still room to improve the remote identification and investigation of heart disease, provide an accurate diagnosis and therapeutic regimen, and update regulations and guidelines to the new realities of technological progress in the field.

An effective system for monitoring patients can improve healthcare delivery by avoiding in-person contacts, enabling early-detection of severe cases, and remotely assessing patients’ status. Internet of Things (IoT) technologies have been used for monitoring patients’ health with wireless wearable sensors in different scenarios and medical conditions, such as noncommunicable and infectious diseases. Combining IoT-related technologies with early-warning scores (EWS) commonly utilized in infirmaries has the potential to enhance health services delivery significantly. Specifically, the NEWS-2 has been showing remarkable results in detecting the health deterioration of COVID-19 patients. Although the literature presents several approaches for remote monitoring, none of these studies proposes a customized, complete, and integrated architecture that uses an effective early-detection mechanism for COVID-19 and that is flexible enough to be used in hospital wards and at home. Therefore, this article's objective is to present a comprehensive IoT-based conceptual architecture that addresses the key requirements of scalability, interoperability, network dynamics, context discovery, reliability, and privacy in the context of remote health monitoring of COVID-19 patients in hospitals and at home. Since remote monitoring of patients at home (essential during a pandemic) can engender trust issues regarding secure and ethical data collection, a consent management module was incorporated into our architecture to provide transparency and ensure data privacy. Further, the article details mechanisms for supporting a configurable and adaptable scoring system embedded in wearable devices to increase usefulness and flexibility for health care professions working with EWS. © 2021"
