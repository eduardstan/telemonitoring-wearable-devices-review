All data was downloaded by topic on **Sept 20th, 2024**, and stored in the `/data/raw/` directory. The raw data is organized according to PRISMA’s principles of systematic, transparent, and reproducible research.

#### 3. **Screening Process**
The screening process was conducted according to PRISMA principles and included the following steps:
- **Title and Abstract Screening**: Initial screening based on the **title** and **abstract** fields. Studies that were irrelevant to healthcare or that did not address telemonitoring and wearable devices were excluded.
- **Full-Text Review**: Eligible studies that passed the initial screening were further evaluated by their full-text for inclusion based on predefined criteria.
- **Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria**: 
  - Inclusion of studies that focused on telemonitoring, wearable devices, and at least one of the refined subtopics.
  - Exclusion of studies outside healthcare or that did not discuss relevant technological, legal, or usability aspects.

#### 4. **Data Management**
- Data was stored in the `/data/raw/` folder, with subfolders for each database and subtopic.
- **Fields Used for Parsing**: The **selected**, **required**, and **optional** fields for parsing data were explicitly defined in `/code/config.py`, and all parsers adhered to these field mappings.
- Parsed data was stored in the `/data/parsed/` folder in CSV format.
- Deduplication was performed using the fields defined in `/code/config.py`, and the cleaned, deduplicated data was stored in `/data/deduplicated/`.

#### 5. **PRISMA Compliance**
