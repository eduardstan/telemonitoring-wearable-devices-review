##### Data Download Specifications
Once the queries were refined for each topic, the data was downloaded according to the following specifications:

- **PubMed**: Data was downloaded in **NBIB format** using the default PubMed settings. 
  - Search was conducted via: [PubMed Advanced Search](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/advanced/).
  
- **Embase**: Data was exported in **RIS format**, avoiding any "Embase mapping options" (e.g., without using Emtree terms).
  - Search was conducted via: [Embase Advanced Search](https://www.embase.com/#advancedSearch/default).

- **Scopus**: Data was exported in **RIS format**, including comprehensive "Citation information" and "Abstract & keywords".
  - Search was conducted via: [Scopus Advanced Search](https://www.scopus.com/search/form.uri).
  
- **IEEE Xplore**: Data was downloaded in **RIS format**, including "Citation and Abstract" details. Since IEEE Xplore limits downloads to maximum 100 records per page, the data was split into multiple files (e.g., `topic_1_100_records.ris`, `topic_101_201_records.ris`).
  - Search was conducted via: [IEEE Xplore Advanced Search](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/search/advanced).

All data was downloaded by topic on **Sept 20th, 2024**, and stored in the `/data/raw/` directory. The raw data is organized according to PRISMA’s principles of systematic, transparent, and reproducible research.

#### 3. **Screening Process**
The screening process was conducted according to PRISMA principles and included the following steps:
- **Title and Abstract Screening**: Based on the presence of the required fields defined in `/code/config.py`: 'title', 'authors', 'venue', 'doi', 'year', and 'abstract'. Records missing any of these fields were skipped.
- **Full-Text Review**: Only records with complete required fields were passed on to full-text review.
- **Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria**: 
  - Inclusion of studies that focused on telemonitoring, wearable devices, and at least one of the refined subtopics.
  - Exclusion of studies outside healthcare or that did not discuss relevant technological, legal, or usability aspects.

#### 4. **Deduplication Process**

##### Random Seed Issue:
Despite using `RANDOM_SEED` in `/code/config.py`, the random seed does not work properly for controlling the deduplication process, as confirmed by the inspection of [Dedupe’s GitHub repository](https://github.com/dedupeio/dedupe/blob/c738749049f4c0e79339afbd6eee4c5ac09eac5c/tests/test_labeler.py#L32), accessed on Sept 23rd, 2024. However, each topic has **settings** and **training** files stored in `/data/deduplicated/` along with the deduplicated CSV files. This ensures that when running the deduplication process again, active labeling of pairs will not be required, ensuring transparency and reproducibility.

##### Labeling Policy:
During the deduplication process, labeling was handled manually during active learning. The following general policy was applied: 
- If one pool (yes/no) reached 40 labeled pairs while the other pool had at least 5 records, the labeling was finished.
- If the second pool had fewer than 5 pairs, the labeling continued until at least 5 pairs were labeled for the second pool or it reached 40 pairs.
- This policy ensures a balanced labeling process while minimizing unnecessary labels.

The results of the deduplication are as follows:

- **Accessibility**: 209 deduplicated records [40/10 positive, 7/10 negative]
- **AI Methods**: 1186 deduplicated records [40/10 positive, 10/10 negative] (Dedupe removes some stop words to reduce computational overload as mentioned in this [Issue](https://github.com/dedupeio/dedupe-examples/issues/39))
- **Communication Protocols**: 76 deduplicated records [33/10 positive, 40/10 negative]
- **Data Privacy and Security**: 356 deduplicated records [40/10 positive, 7/10 negative]
- **Interoperability**: 116 deduplicated records [40/10 positive, 5/10 negative]
- **Laws and Regulations**: 144 deduplicated records [44/10 positive, 5/10 negative]
- **Usability**: 259 deduplicated records [40/10 positive, 8/10 negative]

#### 5. **Data Management**
- **Data Download**: Raw data stored in `/data/raw/`, organized by database (e.g., embase, ieee_xplore) and topic (e.g., accessiblity, ai_methods).
- **Data Parsing**: Parsed data stored in `/data/parsed/` after skipping records missing required fields. The logs keep track of the skipped records due to missing values for transparency.
- **Data Deduplication**: Deduplication data stored in `/data/deduplicated/`handled after parsing using the deduplication module. Skipped records and valid records are tracked to ensure transparency and PRISMA compliance.

#### 6. **PRISMA Compliance**
This systematic review follows the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines to ensure transparency and rigor in the review process. A PRISMA flow diagram documents the study selection process, including records retrieved, screened, and excluded.
